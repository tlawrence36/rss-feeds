      "Military historian Rick Atkinson, known for his Revolutionary War trilogy, is venturing into graphic books",
      "NEW YORK -- Prize-winning military historian Rick Atkinson, a comic book fan growing up, hadn't imagined his own work being suitable for the illustrated format.",
      "Ten Speed Graphic announced Tuesday that a graphic edition of \u201cThe British Are Coming,\u201d the first volume of Atkinson's acclaimed Revolutionary War trilogy, will be out next June, shortly before the country's 250th anniversary. Five more graphic books are planned, to be written by Nora Neus and illustrated by Federico Pietrobon, with Atkinson in close collaboration.",
      "\u201cThey are entirely amenable to my suggestions, \u2018This isn\u2019t quite right,\u2019 or \u2018I think this needs to be explained,\u2019\u201d Atkinson told The Associated Press. \u201cWith the drawings, I pointed out that John Adams, at the time the revolution began was a relatively young man. And they had made him look like the paunchy, bald John Adams of the vice presidency. And they fixed it.\u201d",
      "Atkinson, a Pulitzer Prize winner for his World War II book \u201cAn Army at Dawn,\u201d has been working on his revolutionary trilogy for a decade and published the second volume, \u201cThe Fate of the Day,\u201d this spring. Widely regarded as among the best living military historians, he was a featured commentator in Ken Burns' \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d documentary and has made numerous joint appearances with the filmmaker. He is currently working on the final book of his trilogy.",

      "The author says that he was initially skeptical about the new project. With early memories of Superman comics, he wondered how any illustrator might adapt deeply-researched books that run longer than 500 pages. But the graphic format has been used on everything from \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d to the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. Atkinson changed his mind after Ten Speed Graphic, a Penguin Random House imprint, sent him several adaptations, including of the life of Frederick Douglass and Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw that the comic books of my youth have evolved considerably and I was enthused about it,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThey said, \u2018We acknowledge this is serious history that you do. We don\u2019t intend to dumb it down. Our ambition is to widen the audience, to pitch this story of the American founding to an audience that perhaps might be intimidated by a 560 page book.'\u201d",

      "The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself",
      "NEW YORK -- The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself.",
      "Like so many Jamaican teens of his time, he moved to Kingston in the early 1960s and joined a rising musical movement that would help give voice to the country's independence from Great Britain. A decade later, he helped reggae ascend to the international stage with his starring role in the cult favorite \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d and his featured place on the film's classic soundtrack. In the years following, his songs were covered by everyone from Bruce Springsteen to UB40 and confirmed the music's power to inspire or just get you dancing.",
      "Here are a few songs that trace the arc of his career, and of reggae.",
      "Singing along to an easy, bluesy groove, Cliff had a way of sounding both relaxed and fully committed, and could make a nursery rhyme sound like an anthem: \u201cRoses are red / violets are blue / Believe me / I love you.\u201d He also joined a long popular tradition, most famously expressed in such 1970s standards as Billy Joel's \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and Springsteen's \u201cThunder Road,\u201d of offering praise to a very personal kind of beauty: \u201cAlthough you may not have such a fabulous shape / To suit the rest of the world / But you do suit me and that\u2019s all I want to know.\u201d",
      "Like Marvin Gaye's \u201cWhat's Going On\u201d and other anti-war songs, Cliff's \u201cVietnam\u201d was drawn from the horrors of those who had served overseas. \u201cVietnam\u201d was a seething, mid-tempo chant \u2014 \u201cVi-et-nam, Vi-et-nam,\u201d the very name an indictment, in this song for the death of a soldier who had written home to say he would soon be returning, only for his mother to receive a telegram the next day announcing his death.",
      "One of Cliff's many talents was looking clear-eyed at life as it is, and imagining so well what it could be \u2014 a paradise made real by the melody, the feel and lyrics of \u201cWonderful World, Beautiful People,\u201d a vision so inevitable even the likes of President Richard Nixon and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson can't get in the way. \u201cThis is our world, can\u2019t you see? / Everybody wants to live and be free.\u201d",

      "Onstage, he sometimes literally jumped for joy, but Cliff also could call out the deepest notes of despair. The somber, gospel-style \u201cMany Rivers to Cross\u201d was inspired by the racism he encountered in England in the 1960s and tells a story of displacement, longing, fatigue and gathering rage \u2014 but never defeat. \u201cI merely survive because of my pride,\u201d he tells us, a variation of the old saying that hopes dies last.",
      "Cliff\u2019s political songs were so enduring in part because they were so catchy, and because they offered hope without the promise of easy success. Kicked off by a spare horn riff, \u201cYou Can Get It If You Really Want\u201d has a lighter mood than \u201cVietnam,\u201d but just as determined a spirit. \u201cYou must try, try and try, try and try,\u201d Cliff warns. \u201cPersecution you must fear / Win or lose you got to get your share.\u201d",
      "The title track to the movie which would mark the high point of his success, \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d has a spiky, muscular rhythm, the kind you could set to the forward march of a mass protest. It\u2019s a sermon of retribution for oppressors \u2014 \u201cthe harder they fall, one and all\u201d \u2014 and of earthly rewards for those who have been robbed: \u201cSo as sure as the sun will shine / I\u2019m gonna get my share now, what\u2019s mine.\u201d",

      "A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra's doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor's death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.",
      "\u201cHe was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,\u201d Modi said on social media platform X.",
      "Often called Bollywood\u2019s \u201cHe-Man,\u201d Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India\u2019s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero \u2014 upright, patriotic and fearless \u2014 his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.",
      "Dharmendra\u2019s performance in \u201cSholay\u201d (1975) \u2014 Bollywood\u2019s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India\u2019s greatest films \u2014 earned him enduring popularity.

      "Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.",

By Friday it was playing in 4,115 North American locations and had raked in $68.6 million.

      "In a post on X Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her deep sorrow for the loss of Vanoni, whose \u201cunmistakable voice\u201d left an imprint on Italian culture for generations. \u201cItaly loses a unique artist who leaves us with an unrepeatable artistic heritage,\u201d Meloni said.",
      "Vanoni died of cardiac arrest at her Milan home, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported.",
      "Vanoni recorded more than 100 albums with sales of over 55 million copies, vaulting her to iconic status among generations of fans and earning her the moniker \u201cThe Lady of Italian Song,\u201d according to LaPresse newspaper.",
      "Born in Milan in 1937, Vanoni's first love was the theater, which culminated with performances on the Broadway stage in 1964. But her passion for music combined with what LaPresse described as a \u201chighly personal and sophisticated performing style\u201d and vast repertoire from jazz to pop led her to collaborate with some of the most important songwriters in Italy and abroad.",
      "Vanoni's partnership \u2014 and love affair \u2014 with famed Genovese singer-songwriter Gino Paoli produced the hit \u201cSenza Fine\u201d (Without End), which shot her onto the international stage in 1961.",

      "Rosal\u00eda has won over millions of music lovers for her fusions of flamenco and urban Latin beats",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- And Rosal\u00eda said, \u201cLet there be Lux.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, the global Spanish pop star loved by millions for fusing flamenco with Latin hip-hop and reggaeton, has amazed her fans with a radical shift.",
      "The singer and songwriter\u2019s new album, \u201cLux\u201d (\u201cLight\u201d in Latin), is unabashedly spiritual. Fifteen songs, sung in 13 different languages, including fragments in Latin, Arabic and Hebrew, are laden with a yearning for the divine.",
      "And it is receiving praise from on high.",
      "Xabier G\u00f3mez Garc\u00eda, bishop of Sant Feliu de Llobregat which includes Rosal\u00eda\u2019s hometown of Sant Esteve Sesrovires near Barcelona, was one of the first church leaders to laud her work in an open letter to his flock. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s grandmother regularly attends mass in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, according to the diocese.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, G\u00f3mez said that while some of her songs were \u201cprovocative,\u201d Rosal\u00eda \u201cspeaks with absolute freedom and without hang-ups about what she feels God to be, and the desire, the thirst (to know God).\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I listened to \u2018Lux\u2019 and Rosal\u00eda speaking about her the context of her album and the creative process, I found myself faced with a process and a work that transcended the musical. Here was a spiritual search through the testimonies of women of immense spiritual maturity,\u201d he said.",
      "From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, \u201cWho could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,\u201d Rosal\u00eda announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. \u201cEl mal querer (\u00a8The Bad Loving\u201d in Spanish) and \u201c Motomami \" had established Rosal\u00eda as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats.",
      "Despite \u2014 or thanks to \u2014 its diversity of styles and song forms, ranging from classical strings, snippets of electronica with a cameo by Bj\u00f6rk, a boys' choir from a thousand-year-old monastery, an aria-like song in Italian, a Portuguese fado and, of course, modern flamenco and hip-hop beats, \u201cLux\u201d is off to a powerful start among listeners. It has four songs in Spotify\u2019s Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift.",
      "Madonna has declared herself a fan of \"Lux,\" and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has lavishly called it the \u201calbum of the decade.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, 33, has said that after her success in more popular music forms, she let her long-held longing for the spiritual guide her in making \u201cLux.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, in an age that seems not to be the age of faith or certainty or truth, there is more need than ever for a faith, or a certainty, or a truth,\" she told reporters in Mexico City last month.",
      "She said that she was guided by the concept that \u201can artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda apparently has not had a revelatory \u201ccome-to-Jesus\u201d moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners.",
      "Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music.",
      "While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosal\u00eda seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. \u201cLux\u201d responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess.",

Contrast that now with her look on the \u201cLux\u201d album cover, where she is dressed in a solid white nun's veil with her arms apparently trapped inside a white top, her gaze averted.",

      "Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Culture and Education, told Spanish news agency EFE this month that Rosal\u00eda has detected a wider dissatisfaction with the secular world.",
      "\u201cWhen a creator like Rosal\u00eda speaks of spirituality,\u201d he said, \u201cit means that she captures a profound need in contemporary culture to approach spirituality, to cultivate an inner life.\u201d",
      "Among the songs about faith, Rosal\u00eda found the time to deliver tunes like \u201cLa Perla\" (\"The Pearl\" in Spanish) that dishes out scorn for a former lover.",
      "That deft mix of both high and pop culture is part of the allure of \u201cLux,\u201d said Josep Oton, professor of religious history for the ISCREB theology school in Barcelona.",
      "\u201cShe has succeeded in making popular music with very deep cultural roots,\u201d Oton told the AP. \u201cAnyone can listen to it, and people with different backgrounds can take away different things. It is pop music, but it is profound.\u201d",
      "\u201cLux\u201d can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosal\u00eda was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation.",
      "In the exhilarating \u201cReliquia\u201d (\u201cRelic\u201d in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda compares herself to female saints, listing the parts of her body and life she has left in cities around the world as relics for others\u2019 keeping. Her \u201cMio Cristo Piange Diamanti,\u201d (\"My Christ Weeps Diamonds\" in Italian), brims with the extravagant Baroque image of the jewels dripping from the eyes of the Messiah.",
      "In \u201cDivinize,\u201d Rosal\u00eda sings of the \u201cdivina buidor\u201d (\u201cdivine emptiness\u201d in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter.",
      "Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona\u2019s Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked \u201cLux\u201d for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is \u201ca minimalist\u201d sample of the mystical tradition.",
      "Cirlot said the moving \u201cLa Yugular\u201d (\u201cThe Jugular\u201d in Spanish) is rich in mystical thought because the throat, the home of the voice and the breath, is associated in many religious traditions as the body\u2019s door to the divine.",
      "But, for Cirlot, it\u2019s the entire package that makes \u201cLux\u201d so impactful.",
      "\u201cRosal\u00eda is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,\u201d Cirlot said. \u201cAnd then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\"Wicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a fresh take on the original musical's second act",
      "Are you ready for more \u201cWicked\"? \u201cWicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a bulked-up take on the music of the original \u201cWicked\u201d musical's second act, grounded in yet-again stellar vocals from Cynthia Erivo as a misunderstood but defiant Elphaba and Ariana Grande as a conflicted but changing Glinda. New songs and lyrics raise the stakes \u2014 even if the music itself is at times weighed down by the plot it helps move along, like the film it accompanies.",
      "The soundtrack opens with \u201cEvery Day More Wicked,\u201d a lengthened-version of a section of the original Act 2 opener \u201cThank Goodness\u201d with new verses about Elphaba's perceived wickedness and Glinda's presumed goodness set to bold orchestration that matches the first film's opening number, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\" Drum beats and ensemble singers are the world builders here, twisting the melody into a march.",
      "The album's first solo goes to Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible, the sorceress at the center of a propaganda campaign against Elphaba \u2014 a choice that works for the plot, but which offsets the power of Erivo and Grande's forthcoming vocals. They are introduced later, through brief interpolations of the Act 1 showstoppers \u201cThe Wizard and I\" and \u201cPopular.\" All of that makes for a dynamic film opener \u2014 but is more fractured in audio form, sans the sumptuous visuals and character reveals that tie those musical references together on screen.",
      "Fortunately, \u201cThank Goodness / I Couldn't Be Happier\u201d quickly follows, bringing Grande center-stage \u2014 and providing a rare-here opportunity for her soprano head-voice to give way to a deeper belt (her passionate tone, like other Glindas before her, turns this almost nonsensical lyric, \"There are bridges you cross you didn\u2019t know you crossed until you've crossed them,\" into a revelation). That's not the last we hear from this capital \u201cG\u201d Good, Glinda. \u201cWonderful,\u201d usually a duet between Elphaba and the Wizard of Oz, is \u2018Galinda-fied,\u2019 with Grande adding welcome harmonies \u2014 and a brief \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d interlude \u2014 to Jeff Goldblum's Wizard romp.",
      "It was always going to be hard for this album to live up to the soundtrack of the first \u201cWicked,\u201d which ended with Erivo\u2019s take on the iconic \u201cDefying Gravity\" battle cry, and saw Grande own the over-the-top glitz of \u201cPopular.\" But that grandness is replicated in key moments: In Grande's operatic soprano, in Erivo and Jonathan Bailey's sensual \u201cAs Long As You're Mine,\" in which Bailey as Fiyero manages to keep up with Erivo's beckoning vocals, and in \u201cNo Good Deed,\" the album's sonic peak.",
      "At 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the soundtrack adds over 15 minutes of music to the runtime of the original Broadway cast recording's second act. That includes two brand new songs written for the film (making them eligible for Oscar consideration), one for Erivo\u2019s Elphaba and one for Grande\u2019s Glinda. In lengthening the shorter second act into a 2 hour and 17 minute long film, director Jon M. Chu stretches some of these songs across scenes, filling them out with dialogue, additional verses from composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and additional scoring from composer John Powell. All of that is a double-edged sword (broom? wand?), at times deflating the power of the tight original tracks, at others adding felt emotional stakes ripe for satisfying listening.",
      "For example: Some of the drama of Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater and Erivo's \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d a song performed on Broadway that was also left off the original cast recording, is weakened by which pieces of the interspersed dialogue remain, and which don't, in the soundtrack version of the song. Like the Tin Man, it feels a bit piecemeal.",
      "But the new tracks are highlights, fleshing out the album. Erivo's \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d pulls on the iconic line said by Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\" providing this Oz-inspired show its take on the theme, like another Oz-inspired show, \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d found before. (\"Home,\" that show's nod to the line, was sung by Erivo at this year's Oscars ceremony). The song is the most inherently political, a timely tale of borders, defiance and community. It starts with Erivo's voice almost isolated, strings swelling behind her, and ends with the first of her transcendent vocal runs, restored to a full open note (after being cut short by the Cowardly Lion on screen) in the album.",
      "That power is felt tenfold in Erivo's take on \u201cNo Good Deed.\" The film may belong to Glinda\u2019s emotional trajectory, but it is Erivo who steals the soundtrack's climax. Drums return as the agony heard in her voice intensifies, the strings crescendoing with her final call.",
      "Glinda's emotional journey may at first be more subtle, but Grande portrays it deftly. Airy and introspective, \u201cGirl in the Bubble\u201d serves as turning point, filling in gaps about Glinda's internal reckoning. Her voice is restrained but emotional, Schwartz's lyrics straightforward with a cheese that feels earned, and thus earnest. This is Glinda after all, not Grande.",
      "Both songs boost the emotional payoff of the character\u2019s finale duet, the fan-beloved tear-jerker \u201cFor Good.\" And it's no surprise, years into their own journey with the characters, that Erivo and Grande nail the chemistry of their character's friendship.",

AI-generated music has been flooding streaming services amid the rise of song generators that instantly spit out new tunes based on prompts typed in by users without any musical knowledge.

      "Warner, which represents artists including Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa, has resolved its copyright infringement litigation against Udio, the two companies said. They've also established \u201da clear framework\" for developing Udio\u2019s licensed AI music creation service that's set to launch in 2026.",
      "They provided no financial details on their agreement, which includes Warner's recording and publishing businesses, but it will create \u201cnew revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.\"",

      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",

      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",

      "The White House is circulating a proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two more years",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is circulating a proposal that would extend subsidies to help consumers pay for coverage under the Affordable Care Act for two more years, as millions of Americans face spiking health care costs when the current tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The draft plan suggests that President Donald Trump is open to extending a provision of Obamacare as his administration and congressional Republicans search for a broader policy solution to a fight that has long flummoxed the party. The White House stresses that no plan is final until Trump announces it.",
      "The subsidies were at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 demands in the government shutdown fight that ended earlier this month. Most Democratic lawmakers had insisted on a straight extension of the tax credits, which expire at the end of the year as a condition of keeping the government open.",
      "Eligibility for the Obamacare subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people afford health care coverage, would be capped at 700% of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a White House proposal that is in draft form.",
      "The baseline tax credits that were originally part of the Affordable Care Act were capped at 400% of the federal poverty level, but that cut-off was suspended because of the temporary COVID-era credits that allowed middle- and higher-income people to benefit from subsidies too.",
      "The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their Obamacare plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans that the program has enabled fraud. One option is a requirement that everyone pay 2% of their income, or at least $5 per month, for lower-tier plans.",
      "Even as the White House\u2019s proposal remains in flux, the notion of extending any part of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement is likely to rankle conservatives who have sought to repeal and replace the law for well over a decade.",
      "\u201cUntil President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the administration\u2019s health care positions is mere speculation,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump \u201cis very much involved in these talks\u201d and that he is \u201cfocused on unveiling a health care proposal that will fix the system and will bring down costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "But there are signs that parts of the nascent White House plan could get buy-in from Democrats. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, one of eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus who voted to reopen the government earlier this month, said it \u201crepresents a starting point for serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that President Trump is putting forward any offer at all to extend the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits shows that there is a broad understanding that inaction in this regard will cause serious harm to the American people,\u201d Hassan said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve had constructive conversations with many of my Republican colleagues who I believe want to get this done,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThey understand that the vast majority of people who benefit from these tax credits live in states the President won, and that the President\u2019s own pollsters have underscored the enormous political urgency of Republicans acting.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Trump fell short in a push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, an embarrassing defeat for Republicans who had just seized control of all levers of power in Washington. The GOP has failed to coalesce around a unified health care proposal since, and the expiration of the pandemic-era subsidies gives Trump and his party an opportunity to put their own stamp on the issue.",
      "As the White House worked quietly on its plan, led by the Domestic Policy Council, key lawmakers on Capitol Hill have drafted their own proposals. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and others have proposed various ideas for redirecting the program\u2019s spending on federal subsidies into health savings accounts that enrollees could use to shop for plans or defray out-of-pocket costs. Scott's plan has been discussed with the White House multiple times since it was released Thursday, according to a person familiar not authorized to discuss the private conversations.",
      "The draft of the White House plan would allow those in lower-tier plans, such as the bronze-level or catastrophic plans, to put money into health savings accounts.",
      "It would also codify the \u201cprogram integrity rule\u201d to further help root out fraud, waste and abuse.",
      "Americans shopping for Obamacare coverage have already faced the sticker shock of price hikes, because the window for selecting next year\u2019s coverage began Nov. 1. Without congressional action, the average subsidized enrollee will face more than double their current cost in premiums next year, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",

      "With a runway of smoking-hot coals laid out before them, residents in San Pedro Manrique, Spain, steel themselves as thousands of onlookers cheer them on. The crowd roars when they walk across the fire, sometimes carrying another person on their back.",
      "Although the walkers and the crowd perform very different roles during the annual June ritual, they report similar feelings: an ineffable feeling of togetherness, as if the entire group becomes one, said Dimitris Xygalatas, a cognitive anthropologist at the University of Connecticut, who witnessed the Spanish ritual years ago as a researcher.",
      "He has experienced similar feelings in a stadium while chanting and cheering together with 30,000 fans of his hometown soccer team. Both are instances of collective effervescence, said Xygalatas, author of \u201cRituals: How Seemingly Senseless Acts Make Life Worth Living.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that feeling that happens when people engage together in a meaningful activity that sparks positive emotions. Such as when you get goose bumps at a concert, feel the rush of adrenaline in group exercise classes or get swept up in religious festivals.",
      "Recently, collective effervescence has been referred to as \u201cwe mode,\u201d and it\u2019s something that can be cultivated to improve your life, said Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford University health psychologist.",
      "\u201cWhen you are connected through shared positive emotion, expressions often act as this aerosolized joy, where you catch other people\u2019s smiles, laughter, their physical expressions,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIt becomes contagious.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe mode\u201d has also been called physiological synchrony, and McGonigal calls it \u201ccollective joy.\u201d The concept was documented more than a century ago by French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who described cultural effervescence after studying aboriginal Australian societies.",
      "Xygalatas\u2019 research has focused on measuring it in various group activities. To quantify \u201cautonomic responses,\u201d he has fitted people with heart monitors and electrodes and extracted thousands of stills from videos to analyze facial expressions.",
      "He found that people\u2019s physiological responses synchronize during exciting events. The heartbeats of sports fans who attend a game, for instance, sync up, while those of fans watching the same game on TV don\u2019t. Fans at the game also have higher levels of endorphins, which have been linked to bonding, he said.",
      "On a basic level, collective rituals involve meeting and connecting with people, which is a key to psychological well-being, Xygalatas noted.",
      "\u201cIf we all dress alike and we move alike and we feel alike, we express the same emotions that trigger mechanisms in our brain,\u201d Xygalatas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental need for synchrony.\u201d",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- After an agreement from U.N. climate talks in the Amazon that fell short of many nations' expectations, experts found some bright spots alongside weighty reasons for worry in the fight against global warming.",
      "The Associated Press asked 17 experts \u2014 diplomats, analysts, advocates and scientists \u2014 the simple question: After the talks, known as COP30, in the city of Belem, what's next?",
      "\u201cWe leave here with a clear signal, very very clear signal, that we have entered the era of implementation,\" said U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. \"As we move forward, it\u2019s about doing. It's about rolling sleeves up.\u201d",
      "Others look at the key failure of not delivering a road map to phase out coal, oil and gas \u2014 the main causes of warming. The road map had the public support of Brazil's president and more than 80 nations, but powerful opponents.",
      "\u201cThis should have been the moment. A COP in the Amazon, a president calling for a fossil fuel transition road map, the science screaming for action. But the world blinked again,'' Panama climate negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez said. \u201dThe next year will be harder on communities and ecosystems. Impacts will intensify, because emissions are not slowing down.\"",
      "Stiell pointed to seven different paragraphs in the agreements from Belem that could spur action for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fewer fossil fuels. The COP presidency highlighted 117 \u201caction agenda\u201d items mostly for business to put pledges into real-life action.",
      "That agenda includes a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation. Among the most ambitious actions is a push to raise $1 trillion for renewable electrical grids and energy storage.",
      "One specific action that Stiell and several others emphasized was a new \u201cglobal implementation accelerator,\" a voluntary and cooperative system designed to help nations that want to do more than they've previously proposed in their climate fighting plans. The emphasis is on getting money to where it's needed.",
      "\u201cIf the \u2018ambition accelerator\u2019 can help to do this, it will make a massive difference to the global warming outlook,\u201d said Bill Hare, CEO of the climate science and policy institute Climate Analytics.",
      "Because they couldn't get a consensus at the talks in Belem, the COP30 presidency promised to create two new \u201croad maps,\" one to guide the transition away from fossil fuels and another to stop deforestation. But those road maps won't have the force of something agreed upon in UN talks.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago said his office will study both areas extensively and use science and economics to come up with those plans. He said they would be tailored to different countries' needs.",
      "Do Lago also promised that his office will join with Colombia and the Netherlands to organize a special fossil fuel phaseout conference scheduled next April.",
      "\u201cIf they come with real timelines, accountability and finance, they have the potential to shape global action and hold governments to their word,\u201d said Mariana Paoli of the anti-poverty group Christian Aid. \u201cThey don\u2019t have power on their own, but they can create the structure around which real change is built.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe outcome of COP30 reminds us once again that action dependent on global consensus will never be enough to tackle the climate crisis at scale,\u201d said Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy.",
      "Yet Paoli said these conferences are not powerless. She said they are \"slow and imperfect, yet they have still moved the world forward \u2014 sometimes in unexpected ways.''",
      "\u201cOver the next year, we are likely to see continued escalation of climate impacts alongside gradual progress on climate action,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, director of PowerShift Africa. \u201cRenewable energy expansion will continue, but so will new fossil fuel investments in many parts of the world.\u201d",
      "Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research, said all forms of extreme weather and climate events will increase, hitting the most vulnerable people hardest and threatening the survival of coral reefs and the very Amazon that hosted the talks.",
      "\u201cThese are unacceptable outcomes of a solvable problem,\u201d Rockstrom said.",
      "With the United States' federal government withdrawing from climate action under President Donald Trump, states, cities and businesses are cutting emissions in a way that will allow the U.S. to reach its climate goal, said former U.S. climate envoy Trigg Talley, now a representative of America's All In.",
      "\u201cThe COPs are only one part of a wide tapestry for action on climate change,\u201d said World Resources Institute's International Climate Director David Waskow. \u201cWe need to pull all the levers at our disposal to limit global warming.\"",
      "\u201cThe giant boulder of climate action is already rolling down the hill in the right direction,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cIt already has millions of hands on it. And as each of us adds our hand too, it goes a little faster.\u201d",

      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",

      "More awareness of these rare diseases is critical, said North Carolina's Alexander, who sought out fellow patients. \u201cThat's a terrible feeling, feeling like you're alone.\u201d",
      "As for Morrill, five years later he still grieves decades of lost memories: family gatherings, a year spent studying in Scotland, the travel with his wife.",

      "Scientists say the problem is that they are often doing just the opposite by relying on preliminary studies, fringe science or just hunches to make claims, cast doubt on proven treatments or even set policy.",
      "This week, the nation's top public health agency changed its website to contradict the scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. The move shocked health experts nationwide.",
      "Dr. Daniel Jernigan, who resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August, told reporters Wednesday that Kennedy seems to be \u201cgoing from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making.\u201d",
      "It was the latest example of the Trump administration's challenge to established science.",
      "In September, the Republican president gave out medical advice based on weak or no evidence.

      "At a two-day meeting this fall, Kennedy\u2019s handpicked vaccine advisers to the CDC raised questions about vaccinating babies against hepatitis B, an inoculation long shown to reduce disease and death drastically.",
      "\u201cThe discussion that has been brought up regarding safety is not based on evidence other than case reports and anecdotes,\u201d said Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "During the country's worst year for measles in more than three decades, Kennedy cast doubt on the measles vaccine while championing unproven treatments and alleging that the unvaccinated children who died were \u201calready sick.\u201d",
      "Scientists say the process of getting medicines and vaccines to market and recommended in the United States has, until now, typically relied on gold standard science. The process is so rigorous and transparent that much of the rest of the world follows the lead of American regulators, giving the OK to treatments only after U.S. approval.",
      "The gold standard can differ because science and medicine is complicated and everything cannot be tested the same way. That term simply refers to the best possible evidence that can be gathered.",
      "\u201cIt completely depends on what question you\u2019re trying to answer,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.",
      "There are many different types of studies. The most rigorous is the randomized clinical trial.",
      "It randomly creates two groups of subjects that are identical in every way except for the drug, treatment or other question being tested. Many are \u201cblinded studies,\u201d meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is in which group. This helps eliminate bias.",
      "It is not always possible or ethical to conduct these tests. This is sometimes the case with vaccine trials, \u201cbecause we have so much data showing how safe and effective they are, it would be unethical to withhold vaccines from a particular group,\u201d said Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and founder of the Unbiased Science podcast.",
      "Studying the long-term effect of a behavior can be impossible. For example, scientists could not possibly study the long-term benefit of exercise by having one group not exercise for years.",
      "Instead, researchers must conduct observational studies, where they follow participants and track their health and behavior without manipulating any variables. Such studies helped scientists discover that fluoride reduces cavities, and later lab studies showed how fluoride strengthens tooth enamel.",
      "But the studies have limitations because they can often only prove correlation, not causation. For example, some observational studies have raised the possibility of a link between autism risk and using acetaminophen during pregnancy, but more have not found a connection. The big problem is that those kinds of studies cannot determine if the painkiller really made any difference or if it was the fever or other health problem that prompted the need for the pill.",
      "Scientists can learn even more when they see how something affects a large number of people in their daily lives.",
      "That real-world evidence can be valuable to prove how well something works \u2014 and when there are rare side effects that could never be detected in trials.",
      "Such evidence on vaccines has proved useful in both ways. Scientists now know there can be rare side effects with some vaccines and can alert doctors to be on the lookout. The data has proved that vaccines provide extraordinary protection from disease. For example, measles was eliminated in the U.S. but it still pops up among unvaccinated groups.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The World Health Organization has declared Indonesia\u2019s polio outbreak officially over, following nearly three years of intensive response efforts, officials said Friday.",
      "Indonesia has remained largely polio-free as the highly contagious disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2014. But eight years later, an outbreak emerged in the country's conservative Aceh province, prompted by a dangerous combination of consistently low routine immunization and unhealthy environmental conditions. In 2021, only 50.9% of infants born in Aceh received polio vaccination.",
      "Officials say that polio immunization rates in Aceh are well behind the rest of the country, with efforts hampered by widespread disinformation that the vaccine is incompatible with religious beliefs, among other things. The government has also been prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations since they became available.",
      "Over the next two years, cases appeared in the provinces of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, North Maluku, Central Papua, Highland Papua and South Papua, prompting the mass immunization and information drive. Nearly 60 million additional doses of polio vaccine were administered to children during the response.",
      "The last confirmed polio case was in South Papua province on June 2024. Since then, no poliovirus has been detected in children or in the environment, prompting WHO to declare the outbreak over on Wednesday.",
      "In a joint announcement on Friday, Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin credited the success to \u201cthe dedication of health workers and the commitment of parents and communities,\" while WHO's Western Pacific Regional Director Saia Ma'u Piukala called the achievement \u201ca critical step toward global eradication,\u201d while calling for continued vigilance.",

The second dose of inactivated polio vaccine rose from 1.9 million children or 63% in 2023 to 3.2 million children or 73% last year, aided by the introduction of a hexavalent vaccine which expected to reduce the number of injections children receive and accelerate the development of immunity to various diseases.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is fending off criticism from his own base as some of the environmental and anti-vaccine activists who propelled him into politics have said they want stronger action against vaccines and pharmaceutical companies",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent a recent Wednesday showered in praise from the vice president and health technology CEOs at a glitzy \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d event in Washington, designed to celebrate the health secretary\u2019s successes and the movement he has built.",
      "Yet online, a different narrative of his tenure was playing out as a small but vocal group of Kennedy\u2019s supporters and former employees assailed top Trump administration advisers, claiming they were sabotaging him and redirecting MAHA away from its original goals.",
      "\u201cMAHA is not MAHA anymore,\u201d Gray Delany, a former Department of Health and Human Services official ousted in August, said in a podcast interview that day. \u201cI\u2019m not there, but what I\u2019ve heard of what\u2019s happening today is not the MAHA that we signed up for.\u201d",
      "The criticisms, which grew loud enough that the health secretary took to social media to defend his colleagues two days later, exposed the cracks that are beginning to form within his coalition as it amasses power and broadens in scope.",
      "Several of the environmental advocates and vaccine skeptics who helped propel Kennedy into politics have become impatient with what they view as inadequate action on their priorities. They\u2019re also wary that the Health Department appears willing to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies, tech firms and other big corporations whose motives they don\u2019t trust.",
      "The fissures pose a threat to the cohesion of a movement that has given President Donald Trump an important ally and Republicans access to a new group of voters. They come as cracks have developed in Trump's own Make America Great Again movement over issues like the Epstein files and the White House's focus on global diplomacy.",
      "In the wider public, MAHA has enjoyed soaring popularity. About two-thirds of Americans said they supported the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative from the federal government, according to an Ipsos poll from June.",
      "\u201cMAHA\u2019s growth is a sign of its success,\u201d said HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon. \u201cSecretary Kennedy is leading a broad coalition to make Americans healthier, guided by transparency, accountability and measurable results. The movement\u2019s meaning hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Public health researchers say the genius that fuels Kennedy\u2019s movement \u2014 the universal appeal of making Americans healthier \u2014 can also cause conflicts by inviting competing interests.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale as old as time in politics,\u201d said Matt Motta, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health. \u201cThe bigger your tent is, the harder it can be to make everyone happy.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who helped lead the crusade against COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, has taken many steps to curtail vaccines this year. He pulled $500 million for their development, ousted and replaced every member of a federal vaccine advisory committee and pledged to overhaul a federal program for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also has repeatedly spread false and misleading information about vaccines while in office.",
      "As recently as this week, in a move that thrilled Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "But many of Kennedy's supporters in what they call the \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement say it\u2019s not enough. Some want punishments for companies that profited from vaccine and mask requirements during the pandemic. Others want mRNA-based COVID-19 shots pulled from the shelves, despite scientific consensus that they have saved millions of lives.",
      "In their attacks on the administration last week, a few MAHA influencers and two fired HHS employees suggested White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Kennedy\u2019s close adviser, Stefanie Spear, were conspiring to limit Kennedy\u2019s ability to restrict vaccines and crack down on pharmaceutical companies.",
      "Some Kennedy supporters latched on to the claims and pointed to Wiles\u2019 career history at a lobbying firm that has worked with Pfizer as evidence she\u2019s trying to undermine him. They also shared years-old social media posts from Spear criticizing Trump.",
      "Kennedy defended his colleagues in two posts on X, saying the MAHA movement has \u201cno better friend in Washington\u201d than Wiles and that Spear has become a Trump loyalist.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s focus on our extraordinary achievements to date and the monumental work that still needs to be done,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s build our coalition instead of splintering it.\u201d",
      "Since the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d slogan debuted on the campaign trail last year, Kennedy and Trump have widened the MAHA tent considerably by inviting anyone into the fold who has concerns about Americans\u2019 health, nutrition and chronic disease.",

      "Several of Kennedy\u2019s core supporters said they see the government as a deeply entrenched bureaucracy that won\u2019t be easy to reform, even as they hope he'll be able to remove toxins from food and the environment and further restrict vaccines. Kennedy, at an appearance with western governors Thursday, said he doesn't intend to take away people's access to vaccines.",

      "An early analysis suggests current vaccines may still be somewhat effective against the new version of the flu, which has been the main driver of recent infections, CDC data shows.",
      "Some scientists and medical professionals are more worried about disappointing vaccination rates, a main reason why flu hospitalizations and deaths were unusually bad during last year's flu season \u2014 one of the deadliest this century.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a really severe season,\" said Asefeh Faraz Covelli of the George Washington University School of Nursing.",
      "Last winter, the overall flu hospitalization rate was the highest seen since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Flu was the underlying or a contributing cause of more than 18,000 deaths, and one seven-day stretch early this year saw more than 1,800 deaths \u2014 the highest one-week spike in at least a decade. Child flu deaths also were far higher than usual.",
      "CDC data posted Friday showed low flu activity so far, with only one state \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 reporting moderate activity. Most of the reported infections have been in children, said the CDC's Alicia Budd, who tracks flu infections for the Atlanta-based agency.",
      "Most also have been a new version of the type A H3N2 virus that historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. That type is responsible for most flu infections so far this year, and more than half have been a new subclade K variant that is different from the strain this year's flu shots were built to fight.",

Kennedy Jr. was put in charge of the CDC and other federal health agencies. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist, has fostered uncertainty about the safety of vaccines, including flu shots that contained a preservative called thimerosal.",
      "Indeed, vaccination rates against COVID-19 clearly continue to plummet, with about 6% of children and 14% of adults up to date on their shots, according to other CDC data posted Friday. Each figure is about 3 percentage points less than it was at this point last fall.",
      "For the flu, vaccination trends are a little muddier. Some sources have suggested flu vaccinations are down. Over two million fewer flu shots were given at U.S. pharmacies through the end of October compared to last year, according to data from IQVIA, a health information and research company.",
      "But the latest CDC data indicates that for children, the vaccination rate this year is about the same as it was at this point last fall, at 34%. And the vaccination rate for adults is up a few percentage points to about 37%, according to the CDC data, which relies on survey information.",
      "It is early in the season and too early to know if the increase will be sustained or what is causing it, CDC officials said.",

      "Authorities have seized an average of nine tigers each month over the past five years, highlighting a worsening trafficking crisis",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysa -- Authorities worldwide have seized an average of nine tigers each month over the past five years, highlighting a worsening trafficking crisis that threatens the survival of one of the planet\u2019s most iconic species, according to research released Tuesday.",
      "A new report by wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC warned that criminal networks are evolving faster than conservation efforts can respond. The global wild tiger population, once around 100,000 a century ago, has now plummeted to an estimated 3,700-5,500, it said.",
      "Despite half a century of international protection, TRAFFIC's findings showed that tiger trafficking is accelerating and increasingly targeting whole animals, living or dead. Experts say the shift appears linked to captive-breeding operations, but may also reflect tigers being seized shortly after poaching or before being dismembered for their parts. Additionally, it could be driven by a rise in exotic pet ownership or demand for taxidermy, they say.",
      "The report, the sixth in TRAFFIC\u2019s Skin and Bones series examining the illegal trade in tigers, highlights stark trends. Between 2000 and mid-2025, law enforcement agencies globally recorded 2,551 seizures involving at least 3,808 tigers.",
      "In the five years from 2020 to June 2025 alone, authorities made 765 seizures, confiscating the equivalent of 573 tigers, roughly nine a month over 66 months. The worst single year was 2019, when 141 seizures were recorded, followed by 139 in 2023.",
      "Most of the seizures occurred within the 13 countries which have wild tiger populations, led by India with the world's biggest tiger population, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Among countries without tigers, a sizable number of incidents were reported by Mexico, U.S. and the United Kingdom, the report said. While enforecement has strengthened, so has trade.",
      "\u201cThis rise reflects improved enforcement efforts but also signals persistent and, in some areas, escalating criminal activity and a widespread demand for tigers and their parts,\u201d said Ramacandra Wong, senior wildlife crime analyst and co-author of the report.",
      "TRAFFIC\u2019s latest analysis reveals a dramatic shift: In the 2000s, tiger parts accounted for 90% of seized products but since 2020 that proportion has dropped to 60%, replaced by a spike in seizures of whole animal carcasses and live tigers. More than 40% of confiscations in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia now involve whole tigers.",

      "The report also documents growing \u201cspecies convergence\u201d with almost one in five tiger trafficking incidents involving other threatened wildlife \u2014 most commonly leopards, bears and pangolins.",
      "Patterns of consumption vary sharply by geography. In Mexico and the United States, demand trends toward live tigers, often for exotic pet ownership. Europe shows a stronger market for tiger derivatives used in certain traditional medicines and taxidermy for decoration. Across Asia, demand spans skins, bones, claws and whole dead animals for fashion and traditional medicine.",
      "The report said investigations should not end at the point of seizure. It said strong international cooperation is crucial, and that disruption of organized crime network along the illegal trade chain through intelligence-led, multi-agency enforcement is essential.",
      "Leigh Henry, director of wildlife conservation at the environmental charity WWF, told The Associated Press that the surge in whole-animal trafficking underscored the \u201cprominent role of captive tiger breeding facilities in feeding and perpetuating the illegal trade.\"",
      "\u201cIllegal trade remains the greatest immediate threat to wild tigers. If we don\u2019t urgently scale up investments to combat tiger trafficking \u2014 at all points along the trade chain \u2014 we absolutely face the possibility of a world without wild tigers,\u201d she said.",

      "In her announcement Monday ending temporary protection from deportation for citizens of Myanmar, also known as Burma, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited the military's plans for \u201cfree and fair elections\u201d in December and \u201csuccessful ceasefire agreements\u201d as among the reasons for her decision.",
      "\u201cThe situation in Burma has improved enough that it is safe for Burmese citizens to return home,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The military under Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing seized power from democratically-elected Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and is seeking to add a sheen of international legitimacy to its government with the upcoming elections. But with Suu Kyi in prison and her party banned, most outside observers have denounced the elections as a sham.",
      "\u201cHomeland Secretary Kristi Noem is treating those people just like her family\u2019s dog that she famously shot down in cold blood because it misbehaved \u2014 if her order is carried out, she will literally be sending them back to prisons, brutal torture, and death in Myanmar,\u201d Phil Robertson, the director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cSecretary Noem is seriously deluded if she thinks the upcoming elections in Myanmar will be even remotely free and fair, and she is just making things up when she claims non-existent ceasefires proclaimed by Myanmar\u2019s military junta will result in political progress.\u201d",
      "The military takeover sparked a national uprising with fierce fighting in many parts of the country, and pro-democracy groups and other forces have taken over large swaths of territory.",
      "The military government has stepped up activity ahead of the election to retake areas controlled by opposition forces, with airstrikes killing scores of civilians.",

      "Elias was only 15 when he died in the August 2020 explosion at the Beirut port that blasted through surrounding neighborhoods in the Lebanese capital. Since then Khoury has been among the families who have convened monthly protests calling for justice for the 218 people killed when hundreds of tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate detonated.",

The precarious situation has dissuaded many former congregants from returning to Dardghaya.",

      "Inoperable pistols gifted by FBI Director Kash Patel to senior New Zealand security officials, who had to relinquish them for destruction because they were illegal to possess, were revolvers inspired by toy Nerf guns and popular among amateur 3D-printe...",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Inoperable pistols gifted by FBI Director Kash Patel to senior New Zealand security officials, who had to relinquish them for destruction because they were illegal to possess, were revolvers inspired by toy Nerf guns and popular among amateur 3D-printed weapons hobbyists, documents obtained by The Associated Press show.",
      "The AP first reported that Patel gifted plastic 3D-printed replica revolvers as part of display stands given to New Zealand\u2019s police and spy chiefs, along with two cabinet ministers in July. Police documents released this week identified the model as the Maverick PG22, a working revolver modeled on the brightly colored toy gun of the same name.",
      "Pistols are tightly restricted under New Zealand law, requiring a permit beyond a standard gun license. Law enforcement agencies didn\u2019t say whether the officials who met with Patel held such permits, but without them they couldn\u2019t have legally kept the gifts.",
      "After the officials surrendered the revolvers, emails between police leaders and firearms specialists confirmed the gifts met the legal definition of firearms under New Zealand\u2019s strict laws. 3D-printed weapons are treated the same as other guns in New Zealand.",
      "Patel, the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit New Zealand, was in Wellington to open the FBI\u2019s first standalone office in the country. A spokesperson for Patel didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "In New Zealand, inoperable weapons are treated as functional if they could be made operable with modifications. In August, days after Patel\u2019s visit, police armory team leader Daniel Millar emailed his bosses to outline how simple it would be to make the guns operable.",
      "\u201cThese processes are very straight forward processes and require minimal skills and common \u2018handyperson\u2019 tools,\u201d Millar wrote. He added that these tools were \u201ca battery drill and a drill bit for the holes and a small screw for the firing pin.\u201d",
      "New Zealand\u2019s police union said in February that the Maverick PG22 was among the most common 3D-printed guns seized by officers. Millar wrote that his team requested to keep one of the revolvers for testing, but the police commissioner denied the request and the guns were destroyed on Sept. 25.",
      "\u201cThe first risk is that it can be made viable and it gets into the hands of the wrong person and it\u2019s used for a crime,\u201d said professor Alexander Gillespie, a lecturer on firearms regulation at New Zealand\u2019s University of Waikato. \u201cThe second risk is it just explodes because it\u2019s not actually safe. There\u2019s a reason these have been made in people\u2019s backyards instead of coming from an armory.\u201d",
      "Online instructions for making the Maverick PG22 say it \u201cdoes not feature proper modern safeties and should be used in a controlled environment.\u201d It\u2019s unclear who manufactured Patel\u2019s guns, which Millar wrote had been \u201cmanufactured to a high standard.\u201d",
      "Three top New Zealand law enforcement officials said they received the gifts on July 31. Chambers was one recipient, and the other two were Andrew Hampton, director-general of the country\u2019s human intelligence agency NZSIS, and Andrew Clark, director-general of the technical intelligence agency GCSB.",

      "One of the Ukrainian delegates at Sunday's talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Geneva, Oleksandr Bevz, said the numbers of points in the proposed settlement was reduced but he denied reports the 28-point U.S. peace plan now consisted of 19 points.",

We can confirm that it was reduced to take out points not relating to Ukraine, to exclude duplicates and for editing purposes,\" Bevz told The Associated Press, adding that some points relating solely to relations between Russia and the U.S. were excluded.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday that \u201cthe list of necessary steps to end the war can become workable\u201d after progress was made in Sunday's talks between U.S. and Ukrainian delegates in Geneva.

      "Gloria Esperanza Arriero, the director of Colombia\u2019s national immigration service, told The Associated Press on Monday that her agency is questioning nine members of the Lev Tahor sect after they were detained on Sunday during a hotel inspection.",
      "\u201cWe will likely deport them,\u201d Arriero said, \u201cbecause there are no arrest orders for them in Colombia.\"",
      "She said that the group of 17 children and nine adults arrived in Colombia during the last week of October, and were staying in a hotel in the small northwestern city of Yarumal while they searched for a rural property they could use to start up a new site in the South American country.",
      "Arriero said that there were Interpol yellow notices for five children in the group, who have American and Guatemalan passports. The notices are global alerts issued for people who have been reported as missing, or are potential victims of parental, or criminal abduction.",
      "The official said that her agency decided to act after residents informed police about the presence of members of the sect in Yarumal.",
      "\u201cThe positive thing in all of this is that we got to the children before they had a compound,\u201d Arriero said. \u201cBecause in that case, we would have required a search warrant.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- After being elected in a landslide last year, Britain\u2019s Labour Party government delivered a budget it billed as a one-off dose of tax hikes to fix the public finances, get debt down, ease the cost of living and spur economic growth.",
      "A year on, inflation remains stubbornly high, government borrowing is up and the economy is turgid. The annual budget, due on Wednesday, is expected to bring more tax hikes in pursuit of the same elusive economic boom.",

      "The government says Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will make \u201ctough but right decisions\u201d in her budget to ease the cost of living, safeguard public services and keep debt under control.",
      "She has limited room for maneuver. Britain's economy, the world's sixth-largest, has underperformed its long-run average since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the center-left Labour government elected in July 2024 has struggled to deliver promised economic growth.",
      "Like other Western economies, Britain\u2019s public finances have been squeezed by the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global tariffs. The U.K. bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.",
      "The government currently spends more than 100 billion pounds ($130 billion) a year servicing the U.K.\u2019s debt, which stands at around 95% of annual national income.",
      "Adding to pressure is the fact that Labour governments historically have had to work harder than Conservative administrations to convince businesses and the financial markets that they are economically sound.",
      "Reeves is mindful of how financial markets can react when the government\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up. The short-lived premiership of Liz Truss ended in October 2022 after her package of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets, drove down the value of the pound and sent borrowing costs soaring.",

      "The budget comes after weeks of messy mixed messaging that saw Reeves signal she would raise income tax rates \u2013 breaking a key election promise \u2013 before hastily reversing course.",
      "In a Nov. 4 speech, Reeves laid the groundwork for income tax hikes by arguing that the economy is sicker and the global outlook worse than the government knew when it took office.",
      "After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on the public finances, the government signaled it preferred a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures such as a \u201cmansion tax\u201d on expensive homes and a pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicle drivers.",

      "\u201cYou can give markets confidence, but that probably means raising taxes, which is very unpopular with voters,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you can give voters confidence by trying to minimize the impact of tax rises, but that makes markets nervous because they feel that the government doesn\u2019t have a clear fiscal plan.\u201d",
      "The budget comes as Starmer is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s office sparked a flurry of speculation earlier this month by preemptively telling news outlets that Starmer would fight any challenge to his leadership. What looked like an attempt to strengthen Starmer\u2019s authority backfired. The reports set off jitters verging on panic among Labour lawmakers, who fear the party is heading for a big defeat at the next election.",

      "One of Thursday's reports said that shoppers bought less at U.S. retailers  in September than economists expected. Another said confidence among U.S. consumers worsened  by more than expected, a second signal that the economy could potentially use the help of lower interest rates.",
      "Easier rates can boost the economy by encouraging households and companies to borrow more and investors to pay higher prices for investments than they would otherwise.",
      "A third report, meanwhile, said that inflation at the wholesale level was a touch worse in September than economists expected, but a closely tracked underlying trend was slightly better. That\u2019s important because lower interest rates can make inflation worse, and high inflation is the main deterrent that could keep the Fed from cutting rates.",
      "After taking all the data together, economists suggested the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, could be leaning toward cutting rates on Dec. 10. The Fed has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up a slowing job market.",
      "\u201cTaking a pause on rate cuts would probably do more damage to sentiment than a cut would help,\u201d according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, who also said \u201cPowell doesn\u2019t need to be the Grinch that stole Christmas.\u201d",
      "Easier interest rates can give particularly big boosts to smaller companies, because many of them need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of the smallest U.S. stocks jumped 2.1% to lead the market.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, several retailers leaped after delivering stronger profits for the summer than analysts expected.",

      "Sales rose 0.2% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, in a report delayed more than a month because of the government shutdown. Sales jumped 0.6% in July and August and 1% in June. Numerous reports on inflation, employment, spending, and growth remain delayed and the government won\u2019t likely be caught up until late December.",
      "The retail sales figures suggest that Americans pulled back a bit in September as many households are still struggling with high prices for groceries, rent, and many imported goods hit by tariffs. Still, the modest increase in spending may lift the economy\u2019s growth to a solid 3% or higher annual rate in the July-September quarter, economists forecast, after a sluggish 1.6% expansion in the first half of the year.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Tyson Foods' decision to close a beef plant that employs nearly one third of residents of Lexington, Nebraska, could devastate the small city and undermine the profits of ranchers nationwide.",
      "Closing a single slaughterhouse might not seem significant, but the Lexington plant employs roughly 3,200 people in the city of 11,000 and has the capacity to slaughter some 5,000 head of cattle a day. Tyson also plans to cut one of the two shifts at a plant in Amarillo, Texas, and eliminate 1,700 jobs there. Together those two moves will reduce beef processing capacity nationwide by 7-9%.",
      "Consumers may not see prices change much at the grocery store over the next six months because all the cattle that are now being prepared for slaughter will still be processed, potentially just at a different plant. But in the long run, beef prices may continue to climb even higher than the current record highs \u2014 caused by a variety of factors from drought to tariffs \u2014 unless American ranchers decide to raise more cattle, which they have little incentive to do.",
      "An increase in beef imports from Brazil, like President Donald Trump encouraged last week by slashing tariffs on the South American country, may help insulate consumers while ranchers and feedlots struggle with high costs and falling prices.",
      "Here's what we know about the impact of the plant closure and the changing tariffs:",
      "Clay Patton, vice president of the Lexington-area Chamber of Commerce said Monday that Tyson\u2019s announcement Friday felt like a \u201cgut punch\u201d to the community in the Platte River Valley that serves as a key link in the agricultural production chain.",
      "When it opened in 1990, the Lexington plant that Tyson later acquired revitalized and remade the formerly dwindling town by attracting thousands of immigrants to work there and nearly doubling the population.",
      "When the plant closes in January, the ripple effects will be felt throughout the community, undermining many first-generation business owners and the investment in new housing, Patton said. Tyson said it will offer Lexington workers the chance to move to take open jobs at one of its other plants if they are willing to uproot their families for jobs hundreds of miles away.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we can come through this and we\u2019ll actually become better on the other side of it,\u201d Patton said.",
      "Elmer Armijo was struck by how established the community was when he moved to Lexington last summer to lead First United Methodist Church. He described solid job security, good schools and health care systems and urban development \u2014 all in doubt now.",
      "\u201cPeople are completely worried,\u201d Armijo said. \u201cThe economy in Lexington is based in Tyson.\u201d",
      "Many local churches, Armijo\u2019s included, are already offering counseling, food pantries and gas vouchers for community members.",
      "The prospect of losing a major buyer for cattle and increasing imports from Brazil, which already accounted for 24% of the beef brought into the country this year, only adds to doubts about how profitable the U.S. cattle business might be over the next several years, making it less likely that American ranchers will commit to raising more animals.",

      "Boosting imports from Brazil has the potential to affect the market \u2014 much more than Trump's suggestion to increase imports from Argentina \u2014 since the country sends more beef to America than any other. But for steak lovers, the sky-high price of the cut isn\u2019t likely to be affected regardless, as most imports are lean trimmings that get mixed into ground beef.",
      "Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said it's hard to predict whether imports will continue to account for roughly 20% of the U.S. beef supply next year. He pointed out that Trump's tariffs have changed several times since they were announced in the spring and could quickly change again.",
      "The only constant in the equation has been that consumers have continued to buy beef even as prices soar. Tonsor said on average Americans will consume 59 pounds (27 kilograms) of beef per person this year.",
      "There has long been excess capacity in the meat business nationwide, meaning the nation\u2019s slaughterhouses could handle many more cattle than they are processing. That has only been made worse in recent years as the government has encouraged more smaller companies to open slaughterhouses to compete with Tyson and the other giants that dominate the beef business.",
      "Tyson expects to lose more than $600 million on beef production this year after already reporting $720 million of red ink in beef over the past two years.",
      "Tonsor said it was inevitable that at least one beef plant would close. Afterward, Tyson's remaining plants will be able to operate more efficiently at closer to full capacity.",

      "\u201cOur frustrations with the U.S. and South Korean governments are growing over their suspensions of radio broadcasts,\" said Lee, a defector who heads the small, nongovernmental FNK radio station. \"We're afraid that they've abandoned North Korean residents.\u201d",
      "In North Korea, all radio and TV sets are fixed to state-run channels.",
      "But defectors have testified that they modified their radios or used smuggled ones to covertly tune in to foreign broadcasts at night for news their government didn't want them to hear. That includes outside perspectives of the North's ruling Kim dynasty, more affluent and freer Western lifestyles, and success stories about defectors.",
      "But a respected academic website focused on North Korea, 38 North, assessed last month that such outside radio broadcasting toward North Korea was down by 85% after cuts made by the U.S. and South Korean governments.",
      "Two major U.S.-funded broadcasters \u2014 the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia \u2014 were forced to stop their Korean-language radio broadcasts after U.S. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order effectively dismantling the agency that oversaw or provided funding to media networks. Trump said the networks had a liberal bias or were wasteful.",
      "South Korea's liberal government led by President Lee Jae Myung halted cross-border radio broadcasts in an attempt to lower animosities with North Korea.

The Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Law reportedly imposes up to 10 years of imprisonment with hard labor on those who consume, possess or spread foreign movies and music, and up to five years on those who use unauthorized radio and TV channels.",

      "In July, South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young called radio and loudspeaker broadcasts \u201ca relic of the Cold War\" and expressed hope that their suspension would improve ties with North Korea. In response to questions posed by The Associated Press, the South Korean Defense Ministry said the suspension of its \u201cVoice of Freedom\u201d radio broadcast was designed to ease military tensions with North Korea.",

It might never get harvested, it might spoil in transit or the grocery store might reject it for being the wrong size or color. That's a big reason why some consumers are looking for less-wasteful alternatives ranging from farmers markets to delivery services for produce that didn't meet supermarket size or appearance standards.",

      "Local farmers are also likely to grow whatever works best for the area's climate and season. \u201cWhen things are in season, they need less storage time, so less electricity for cold storage,\u201d said Van Soelen Kim, who added that can also mean a smaller food bill.",
      "It\u2019s not pollution-free, because the crops still require land and water, and the food does travel some distance. But CSAs avoid many steps in the modern food supply chain.",
      "That model is challenging for consumers who want to maintain the same shopping list year-round. Shopping in-season requires more flexibility. \u201cI would encourage consumers to think, \u2019OK, year-round we want some hand fruit that\u2019s firm,'\u201d she said. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s apples, and then it\u2019s pears, and then its gonna move to kiwis, and then is gonna move to pluots.\u201d",
      "And in colder regions, she said there is still local produce. It's just more likely to be dried, frozen or canned.",
      "Kolodinsky said the oldest alternative food system is the farmers market, where vendors gather and sell directly to consumers. Growers also sell at farm stands that aren\u2019t tied to a centralized, scheduled event.",
      "Farmers markets allow consumers more flexibility to pick the produce than a typical CSA. They also offer seasonal produce and less packaging and processing than a grocery store. Many also accept payment associated with government food assistance programs.",

      "Farmers who sell to grocery stores typically have to meet high standards, Woods said. For example, there could be onions that never got big enough or the carrot that grew two roots \u2014 vegetables that are just as safe and tasty to eat. There's also surplus harvest.",

      "Van Soelen Kim said there isn't a lot of data yet on whether these services have a significantly lower climate impact. They reduce food waste, but the food might come from far away.",
      "Misfits Market refreshes its online selection weekly. Customers then fill a box of often discounted groceries that might have misprinted labels or are undersized or blemished. They are delivered via a company truck or third-party courier such as FedEx. The company's founder and CEO, Abhi Ramesh, said it minimizes emissions by having set delivery days instead of offering on-demand delivery.",
      "\u201cBy doing that, we batch all of our deliveries together. So it is one van to your ZIP code on that day. One truck that goes from our warehouse on that date,\u201d he said.",
      "Ramesh said sometimes a farmer's market or CSA is even better at offering nearby seasonal food than his company. But for a lot of the country, those services go away when the harvest season ends. \u201cAnd so your local grocery store, believe it or not, is still transporting that from California. But the difference is we\u2019re able to go and transport the food waste piece, which reduces a ton of emissions.\u201d",

In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try. Their drinks arrived via a drone buzzing through the drizzle about 30 minutes later.",

      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

      "Avian viruses are the main culprit. But another reason for turkey\u2019s higher wholesale prices has been an increase in consumer demand as other meats have gotten more expensive, Jordan said. Beef prices were up 14% in September compared to last year, for example.",

      "That\u2019s the case for Paul Nadeau, a retired consultant from Austin, Texas, who plans to smoke a turkey this week. Nadeau said he usually smokes a brisket over Thanksgiving weekend, but the beef brisket he buys would now cost more than $100. Turkey prices are also up at his local H-E-B supermarket, he said, but not by as much.",

Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "In Illinois, where most of the country\u2019s canning pumpkins are grown, dry weather actually helped pumpkins avoid diseases that are more prevalent in wet conditions, said Raghela Scavuzzo, an associate director of food systems development at the Illinois Farm Bureau and the executive director of the Illinois Specialty Growers Association.

      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation are announcing a strategic partnership",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the most storied American philanthropies is teaming up with the internet's biggest creator to instill young people with a concern for what they call the world's \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d populations.",
      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced a strategic partnership Monday. The idea is to pair Donaldson's unique ability to capture youth attention spans with the foundation's 112-year history of using its resources and technology to tackle global problems.",
      "Speaking together ahead of a Nov. 21 video shoot at MrBeast's Greenville, North Carolina, studio, the partners complimented the respective strengths they hope to exchange with each other.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life making YouTube videos. They\u2019ve spent their entire lives helping people,\" Donaldson told The Associated Press. \"Obviously, they have a team who\u2019s way more experienced than me in helping people, but being able to pull on their knowledge and wisdom is amazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want to download their brains into our team\u2019s brains,\" he added.",
      "Dr. Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the philanthropic sector has long failed to capture \u201cthe hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of young people.\u201d He said MrBeast can help them engage young people, inspire hope and communicate their work more accessibly.",
      "Most people have a natural desire to help others, according to Shah, but we teach ourselves that world problems are \u201ctoo big and too complicated\u201d to solve. He pointed to MrBeast's video in Zambia, where they provided a village with solar-powered electricity and clean water wells.",
      "\"What Jimmy\u2019s already done is show that you can change that dramatically,\u201d Shah said. \"If we can get people believing that they can make a difference through this collaboration, we will have achieved something really unique and really special.\u201d",
      "The move signals Donaldson's continued attempts to evolve an organization with sprawling interests that include an entertainment studio, food brands, his own James Patterson book deal and, most recently, a limited time theme park in Saudi Arabia. He brought on venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold as CEO last year and then hired more new executives as a series of controversies threatened his ambitions ahead of his Amazon Prime reality game show 's release.",
      "It's an unlikely marriage to some. The Rockefeller Foundation is a pillar of civil society established with wealth amassed by the 19th-century oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller during the Gilded Age whereas the 27-year-old Donaldson represents the 21st century \u201cinfluencer\u201d economy where entire media empires can emerge from content creators' viral stunts and the online buzz they generate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an influencer like MrBeast embrace the expertise of established philanthropy \u2014 of the Rockefeller Foundation, in particular \u2014 to hone the work of his platform,\u201d said Phila Engaged Giving founder Stephanie Ellis-Smith. \u201cHonestly, to me, it shows a sense of humility in his approach that I personally haven\u2019t seen before.\"",
      "Ellis-Smith, who helps wealthy donors make a bigger impact, said difficult world problems require a \u201cthoughtful approach,\u201d as well as \u201cnumbers\u201d and \u201ceyeballs.\u201d She said it\u2019s exciting to consider the possibilities of combining MrBeast\u2019s reach and \u201creal expertise.\u201d",
      "Shah acknowledged that the Rockefeller Foundation rarely does partnerships of this kind. But he said that spending time with Donaldson and his mother, as well as watching his philanthropically minded videos, communicated the YouTube megastar's \u201cpersonal commitment to philanthropy.\"",

      "\u201cWe bring innovation, a sense of purpose and a deep commitment to measuring results to those efforts. And, over time, it\u2019s literally helped hundreds of millions of people escape poverty, hunger and disease,\" Shah said. \u201cI just think Jimmy, and the enterprise he\u2019s built and the perspective that he brings, is totally consistent with that.\u201d",
      "The exact issues they plan to tackle together are still being hammered out and there is no shared grantmaking to announce yet. But Shah mentioned that the Rockefeller Foundation has a long history of combatting child hunger and noted Beast Philanthropy\u2019s video on a school meal program.",
      "Already, though, they have started working to combat child labor in the cocoa industry.",
      "Through his snack company, Feastables, Donaldson says he wants to prove that chocolate can be profitable without using child labor on cacao farms. He hopes to provide farmers with living incomes, create stable economic conditions so children can go to school instead of farms and use his YouTube channel to rally consumers around fair-trade practices.",
      "The Rockefeller Foundation has consulted MrBeast on \u201chow they should go about the case study,\u201d according to Donaldson. To that end, the two organizations say they will visit Ghana early next year to \u201clearn from one another's work in development, community-led change, and global storytelling.\u201d",

      "The philanthropic sector often gets \u201cstuck in their way of doing things,\u201d according to Giving Compass Director of Development and Philanthropic Partnerships Milan Ball, who said Monday's announcement represents a welcome change.",
      "Ball, 28, found it especially powerful given Donaldson\u2019s track record of raising millions in a single day. She suggested his videos don\u2019t just reach children \u2014 an important audience for Rockefeller given Gen Z\u2019s declining trust in institutions \u2014 but also their parents.",

      "\u201cI think the shutdown at this point is history for air travel. The airlines understand this time of year so well. They know exactly what they need to do,\u201d said Sheldon H.

      "The Weather Channel offers a Thanksgiving weekly forecast highlighting major airports and highways that could be affected by bad weather \u2014 including snow, ice and rain \u2014 along with a free online tool that shows how the weather might impact your travel route.",
      "On Tuesday, the FAA's busiest day with more than 52,000 flights scheduled, forecasters say rain could cause problems in the Pacific Northwest and for much of the eastern U.S. Airports in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C., could be impacted, according to the Weather Channel.",
      "Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, recommends starting your packing by unpacking.",
      "Check every pocket in case TSA-restricted items, like full-sized bottles, were left behind from a previous trip. This simple scan can help you get through security faster, especially when airports are crowded.",

      "Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.",
      "The Treasury Department\u2019s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a \u201c whole of government \u201d approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government \u2014 not just Homeland Security \u2014 to come up with ways to help carry out the president\u2019s hardline immigration agenda.",
      "The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver\u2019s Match Credit.",
      "The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as \u201cfederal public benefits\u201d within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.",
      "According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to back down from some tariffs is being celebrated by tea importers, who say the levies have been devastating this year",
      "NEW YORK -- A tax on tea once sparked rebellion. This time, it\u2019s just causing headaches.",
      "Importers of the prized leaves have watched costs climb, orders stall and margins shrink under the weight of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Now, even after Trump has given them a reprieve, tea traders say it won\u2019t immediately undo the damage.",
      "\u201cIt took a while to work its way through the system, these tariffs, and it will take a while for it to work its way out of the system,\u201d says Bruce Richardson, a celebrated tea master, tea historian and purveyor of teas at his shop, Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, in Danville, Kentucky. \u201cThat tariffed tea is still working its way out of our warehouses.\u201d",
      "While a handful of bigger firms are behind the biggest supermarket brands, the premium tea market is largely the work of smaller businesses, from family farms to specialty importers to a web of little tea shops, tea rooms and tea cafes across the U.S. Amid an onslaught of tariffs, they have become showcases for the levies\u2019 effects.",
      "On their shelves, selection has narrowed, with some teas now missing because they\u2019re no longer viable products to stock with steep levies on top. In their warehouses, managers are consumed with uncertainty and operational headaches, including calculating what a blend really costs, with ingredients from multiple countries on a roller coaster of tariffs. And in backrooms where the wafting scent of fresh tea permeates, owners have been forced to put off job postings, raises, advertising and other investments so they can have cash available to pay duties when their containers arrive at U.S. ports.",
      "\u201cIf I were to add up all the money I\u2019ve spent on tariffs that weren\u2019t there a year ago, it could equal a new employee,\u201d says Hartley Johnson, who owns the Mark T. Wendell Tea Company in Acton, Massachusetts.",
      "Johnson\u2019s prices used to stay static for a year or longer. He ate the tariff costs before being forced to respond. His most popular tea, a smoky Taiwanese one called Hu-Kwa, has steadily risen from $26 to $46 a pound.",
      "He knows some customers are reconsidering.",
      "\u201cWhere is that tipping point?\u201d Johnson asks. \u201cI\u2019m kind of finding that tipping point is happening now.\u201d",
      "Though Trump backed off some tariffs on agricultural products last week, many in the tea trade are wary of celebrating too soon and caution tea drinkers shouldn\u2019t either. Much of next year\u2019s supply has already been imported and tariffed and the full impact of those duties may not have fully spilled downhill.",
      "Meantime, other tariff-driven price hikes persist. All sorts of other products tea businesses import, from teapots to infusers, remain subject to levies, and costs for some American-made items, like tins for packaging, have spiked because they rely on foreign materials.",
      "\u201cThe canisters, the bamboo boxes, the matcha whisks, everything that we import, everything that we sell has been affected by tariffs,\u201d says Gilbert Tsang, owner of MEM Tea Imports in Wakefield, Massachusetts.",
      "Though globally, tea reigns supreme, imbibed more than anything but water, it has long been overshadowed by coffee in the U.S. Still, tea is entwined in American history from the very beginning, even before colonists angry with tariffs dumped tons of it in Boston Harbor.",
      "Boston may run on Dunkin\u2019 today, but it was born on tea.",
      "The 1773 revolt that became known as the Boston Tea Party rose out of the British Parliament\u2019s implementation of tea tariffs on colonists, who rejected taxation without representation in government. After an independent United States was born, one of the new government\u2019s first major acts, the Tariff Act of 1789, ironically set in law import taxes on a range of products including tea. In time, though, trade policy came to include carve-outs for many products Americans rely on but don\u2019t produce.",

      "Radio Free Europe's Hungarian service, Szabad Eur\u00f3pa, has ceased operations after the Trump administration decided to cut its funding",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The Hungarian service of Radio Free Europe, Szabad Eur\u00f3pa, ceased its operations on Friday after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump announced it would no longer fund the pro-democracy news outlet.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is funded by the U.S. government, was first established during the Cold War to provide news and information to people living within the Soviet Union and behind the Iron Curtain. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.",
      "The Hungarian service was terminated in 1993 but reintroduced in 2020 after the United States Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency, and the U.S. Congress approved its relaunching in response to Hungary's steep decline in media freedom under Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "In a statement on Thursday announcing the end of its operations, Szabad Eur\u00f3pa wrote that it had \u201cworked with dedication to provide the best of journalism and objective information to Hungarian readers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe thank you for the trust, interest and support we have received from our audience,\u201d the statement reads, adding that its articles will still be available online.",
      "The shuttering of Szabad Eur\u00f3pa came as the Trump administration has made major cuts to international broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America, as well as domestic public broadcasters PBS and NPR.",
      "Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, informed Congress in a letter earlier this month that the agency would no longer fund Szabad Eur\u00f3pa, writing that its operations in Hungary were \u201cnot aligned with U.S. national interests\u201d and that they \u201cundermined\u201d Trump's foreign policy.",

      "Since returning to power in 2010, Orb\u00e1n, a Trump ally, has overseen the construction of a massive pro-government media machine in Hungary while numerous independent newspapers and outlets have been shuttered or brought under the control of figures with close government ties.",
      "According to press watchdog Reporters Without Borders, Orb\u00e1n has used media buyouts by government-connected oligarchs to build \u201ca true media empire subject to his party\u2019s orders.\u201d The group estimates that such buyouts have given Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party control of some 80% of Hungary\u2019s media market resources. In 2021, it put Orb\u00e1n on its list of media \u201cpredators,\u201d the first European Union leader to earn the distinction.",
      "Earlier this year, Orb\u00e1n's party introduced legislation that would blacklist and fine critical media outlets that receive funding or grants from abroad.",

      "BROOKLINE, Mass. -- For the past several years, 75-year-old Miguel Laboy has smoked a joint with his coffee every morning. He tells himself he won\u2019t start tomorrow the same way, but he usually does.",
      "\u201cYou know what bothers me? To have cannabis on my mind the first thing in the morning,\u201d he said, sparking a blunt in his Brookline, Mass., apartment. \u201cI\u2019d like to get up one day and not smoke. But you see how that\u2019s going.\u201d",
      "Since legalization and commercialization, daily cannabis use has become a defining \u2014 and often invisible \u2014 part of many people\u2019s lives. High-potency vapes and concentrates now dominate the market, and doctors say they can blur the line between relief and dependence over time so that users don\u2019t notice the shift. Across the country, people who turned to cannabis for help are finding it harder to put down.",
      "Overall, alcohol remains more widely used than cannabis. But starting in 2022, the number of daily cannabis users in the U.S. surpassed that of daily drinkers \u2014 a major shift in American habits.",
      "Researchers say the rise has unfolded alongside products that contain far more THC than the marijuana of past decades, including vape oils and concentrates that can reach 80% to 95% THC. Massachusetts, like most states, sets no limit on how strong these products can be.",
      "Doctors warn that daily, high-potency use can cloud memory, disturb sleep, intensify anxiety or depression and trigger addiction in ways earlier generations didn\u2019t encounter. Many who develop cannabis use disorder say it\u2019s hard to recognize the signs because of the widespread belief that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive. Because the consequences tend to creep in gradually \u2014 brain fog, irritability, dependence \u2014 users often miss when therapeutic use shifts into compulsion.",
      "Laboy, a retired chef, began seeing a substance-use counselor after telling his doctor he felt depressed, unmotivated and increasingly isolated as his drinking and cannabis use escalated.",
      "Naltrexone helped him quit alcohol, but he hasn\u2019t found a way to quit marijuana. Unlike alcohol and opioids, there is no FDA-approved medication to treat cannabis addiction, though research is underway.",
      "Laboy, who first smoked at 18, said marijuana has long soothed symptoms tied to undiagnosed ADHD, childhood trauma and painful experiences \u2014 including cancer treatment and his son's death. Through decades in restaurant kitchens, he considered himself a \u201cfunctional pothead.\u201d",
      "Lately, though, his use has become compulsive. After retiring, he began vaping 85% THC cartridges.",
      "\u201cThese days, I carry two things in my hands: my vape and my cellular \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it, but it\u2019s the reality.\u201d",
      "Cannabis eases his anxiety and \u201csettles his spirit,\u201d but he\u2019s noticed it affects his concentration. He hopes to learn to read music, but sustaining focus at the piano has grown difficult.",
      "He\u2019s seen an addiction psychiatrist for six months, but he hasn\u2019t been able to cut back. The medical system doesn\u2019t seem equipped to help, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d Laboy said. \u201cI go to them for help, but all they say is, \u2018Try to smoke less.\u2019 I already know that \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m there.\u201d",
      "Younger users describe a similar slide \u2014 one that begins with relief and ends somewhere harder to define.",
      "Kyle, a 20-year-old Boston University student, says cannabis helps him manage panic attacks he\u2019s had since high school. He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used because he buys cannabis illegally.",
      "In the Allston apartment he shares with fraternity brothers, they have a communal bong.",
      "When he\u2019s high, Kyle feels calm \u2014 and able to process anxious thoughts and feel a sense of gratitude. But that clarity has become harder to reach when he\u2019s sober.",

      "Since Marc Buoniconti",
      "Marc Buoniconti said his father, the late NFL Hall of Famer Nick Buoniconti, explained the secret to the success of their nonprofit and its fundraising efforts simply: \u201cWe\u2019re just not good listeners.\u201d",
      "In the 40 years since Marc Buoniconti, then a college football linebacker at the Citadel, was paralyzed during a routine tackle, they have been told countless times that it was a problem that couldn\u2019t be fixed. The Buonicontis didn\u2019t listen.",
      "Instead, through the fund that bears their name, they have helped raise more than $550 million for The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, and improved the lives of millions with spinal cord and brain injuries.",
      "\u201cThe Buoniconti Fund has lasted because we\u2019re relentless,\u201d Marc Buoniconti recently told The Associated Press. \u201cWe never give up. When we see a challenge, we face it head-on and don\u2019t stop until we find a solution. It\u2019s that determination, that refusal to quit that\u2019s kept us going all these years.\u201d",
      "That drive has also led The Miami Project to expand its work beyond curing paralysis. Its research center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine now also studies neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and it is testing the brain-computer interface implant from Elon Musk\u2019s technology company Neuralink.",
      "Dr. Barth A. Green, chairman of The Miami Project, who co-founded the organization in 1985 with Nick Buoniconti, says the most surprising developments from the center have been the broadest ones.",
      "\u201cEvery operating room in the world that puts people to sleep monitors their nervous system for safety,\u201d Dr. Green said. \u201cThat was all developed at The Miami Project.\u201d",
      "Therapeutic hypothermia, where the body is cooled after an injury to protect the brain and spinal cord, is another widely used treatment developed at the center.",
      "Dr. Green said that before Buoniconti\u2019s accident he had been working on helping those who had been paralyzed for 20 years. Yet there wasn\u2019t a hub for that work until The Miami Project was established.",
      "It provided a home for him and \u201cthousands of scientists and researchers in Miami and around the world, who were equally engaged by the opportunity to change people\u2019s everyday quality of life and their opportunities to have more function and a better opportunity to be mobile and do things they never dreamt they could before.\u201d",
      "Miami Project Scientific Director W. Dalton Dietrich III said gathering those people from a variety of disciplines \u2013 neuroscientists, researchers, clinicians, biomedical engineers \u2013 into one building has led to unexpected advances.",
      "\u201cNot one particular treatment is going to cure paralysis,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve tried to look at other disciplines to bring into the project to help us achieve that goal.\u201d",
      "One new, multidisciplinary area, neuromodulation, is \u201csomething we never thought about five years ago,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an exciting area where you can stimulate these residual circuits after brain injury or spinal cord injury in patients and they start moving their limbs.\u201d",

      "Marc Buoniconti says \u201cit\u2019s hard to put into words\u201d seeing so many people rally behind him and the millions of others who have been paralyzed.",
      "\u201cWhat started as a promise to help me walk again became a mission to help millions,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery resource, every dollar, every hour given is a testament to the belief that we can change lives.\u201d",
      "Mark Dalton, chairman and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., said that belief resonated with him and made him want to get involved with The Buonicontis even before he met them.",
      "\u201cI had tremendous admiration for him as a father who was never going to give up on finding a cure for what ailed his son,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cAnd his son was a representation of millions of other people.\u201d",
      "Once he learned more about The Miami Project, Dalton said he was impressed by its science-driven approach. Its setting on a university campus was also important to the former chairman of the board of trustees at Denison and Vanderbilt universities.",

      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services.

      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",

      "Less than one-third of China's low-altitude airspace was accessible for general aviation use in 2023 and there were problems with uneven distribution and a lack of internet connectivity, Zhang, the State Information Center researcher, said in a report. The number of registered general aviation aerodromes in China, excluding private airports, was just about a tenth of those in the U.S., she said.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks will soon decide on a newly forged final deal released on Saturday that does not include a plan to wean the world from the coal, oil and gas that is heating the planet.",
      "While guidelines wanted by 80 nations for a fossil fuel phase-out are not in the document called \u201cUniting humanity in a global mobilization against climate change,\u201d the Brazilian presidency has promised it will join Colombia in coming up with an independent road map that's not needed to be approved by all 190 nations.",
      "\u201cWhile far from what's needed, the outcome in Belem is meaningful progress,\u201d said former German special climate envoy Jennifer Morgan, who is now a fellow at Tufts University.",
      "The conference leaders are aiming for an early afternoon meeting with all nations to approve the deal. Some nations could try to scuttle it if they prefer no deal to what they consider a feeble agreement, but Morgan said she doubted that any country will block the agreement. It was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago's office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weak outcome,\" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.",
      "A fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by do Lago's team that won't carry the same weight as a deal accepted by nations at the conference.",
      "In the text, instead of a transition plan away from fossil fuels, the agreement \u201cacknowledges that the global transition toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future,\u201d and says \u201cthe (2015) Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster.\u201d",
      "The annual talks this year are held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and worked through the night.",
      "Some of the biggest issues include how to distribute $300 billion a year \u2014 a sum previously agreed upon \u2014 in financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change, getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions and dealing with climate trade barriers. Poorer nations have requested a tripling of financial aid for adapting to extreme weather and other climate change harms. While that's in the deal, the deadline has been moved back five years to 2035.",
      "Also included in the agreement is the final result of the Action Agenda, which was a list of initiatives aimed at making progress on past deals. That included: a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation.",
      "Whatever deal is proposed still needs a consensus approval from what\u2019s left of the nearly 200 nations that came to the two-week conference. Some delegates, observers and others had to leave Saturday morning when the cruise ships lodging them set sail.",

      "Agreements coming out of COP30 technically have to be approved by consensus. But in the past, individual countries' objections have been overlooked by the chair in the rush to gavel everything to the end.",
      "One of the points that negotiators will highlight is language sprinkled in the document that won\u2019t be an explicit road map away from fossil fuels, but will refer back to previous agreements to maintain momentum and \"live and fight another day,\u201d said Alden Meyer, a veteran analyst for the European think-tank E3G.",

      "Researchers have completed a full accounting of water uses and losses in the Rio Grande-Bravo basin as it faces severe shortages throughout its range in the United States and Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- One of North America's longest rivers, the Rio Grande \u2014 or Rio Bravo as it's called in Mexico \u2014 has a history as deep as it is long. Indigenous people have tapped it for countless generations, and it was a key artery for Spanish conquistadors centuries ago.",
      "Today, the Rio Grande-Bravo water basin is in crisis.",
      "Research published Thursday says the situation arguably is worse than challenges facing the Colorado River, another vital lifeline for western U.S. states that have yet to chart a course for how best to manage that dwindling resource.",
      "Without rapid and large-scale action on both sides of the border, the researchers warn that unsustainable use threatens water security for millions of people who rely on the binational basin. They say more prevalent drying along the Rio Grande and persistent shortages could have catastrophic consequences for farmers, cities and ecosystems.",
      "The study done by World Wildlife Fund, Sustainable Waters and a team of university researchers provides a full accounting of the consumptive uses as well as evaporation and other losses within the Rio Grande-Bravo basin. It helps to paint the most complete \u2014 and most alarming \u2014 picture yet of why the river system is in trouble.",
      "The basin provides drinking water to 15 million people in the U.S. and Mexico and irrigates nearly 2 million acres of cropland in the two countries.",
      "The research shows only 48% of the water consumed directly or indirectly within the basin is replenished naturally. The other 52% is unsustainable, meaning reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself will be overdrawn.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty daunting, challenging reality when half of our water isn\u2019t necessarily going to be reliable for the future,\" said Brian Richter, president of Sustainable Waters and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cSo we have to really address that.\"",
      "By breaking down the balance sheet, the researchers are hopeful policymakers and regulators can determine where water use can be reduced and how to balance supply with demand.",
      "Warnings of what was to come first cropped up in the late 19th century when irrigation in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley began to dry the snowmelt-fed river, resulting in diminished flows as far south as El Paso, Texas. Now, some stretches of the river run dry for months at a time. The Big Bend area and even Albuquerque have seen dry cracked mud replace the river more often in recent years.",
      "Irrigating crops by far is the largest direct use of water in the basin at 87%, according to the study. Meanwhile, losses to evaporation and uptake by vegetation along the river account for more than half of overall consumption in the basin, a factor that can't be dismissed as reservoir storage shrinks.",
      "The irrigation season has become shorter, with canals drying up as early as June in some cases, despite a growing season in the U.S. and Mexico that typically lasts through October.",
      "In central New Mexico, farmers got a boost with summer rains. However, farmers along the Texas portion of the Pecos River and in the Rio Conchos basin of Mexico \u2014 both tributaries within the basin \u2014 did not receive any surface water supplies.",
      "\u201cA key part of this is really connecting the urban populations to what\u2019s going on out on these farms. These farmers are really struggling. A lot of them are on the brink of bankruptcy,\" Richter said, linking water shortages to shrinking farms, smaller profits and less ability to afford labor and equipment.",

      "The analysis found that between 2000-2019, water shortages contributed to the loss of 18% of farmland in the headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.",
      "With fewer farms, less water went to irrigation in the U.S. However, researchers said irrigation in the Mexican portion of the basin has increased greatly.",
      "The World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Waters are working with researchers at the University of New Mexico to survey farmers on solutions to the water crisis.",
      "Jason Casuga, the chief engineer and CEO of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, said he is not surprised by the findings and was particularly interested in the data on how much water is lost to riparian areas along the river. He talked about his crews clearing thick walls of thirsty invasive salt cedar trees, describing it as an unnatural ecosystem that stemmed from human efforts to manage the river with levees and reservoirs.",
      "While cities and farmers try to conserve, Casuga said there are few rules placed on consumption by riparian areas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re willing to accept hundreds and hundreds of acres of invasive species choking out native species. And I'm hoping a study like this will cause people to think and ask those kinds of questions because I think our bosque is worth fighting for. As a culture in New Mexico, agriculture is worth fighting for,\u201d he said.",
      "The responses to overuse and depletion are as varied as the jurisdictions through which the river flows, said Enrique Prunes, a co-author of the study and the manager of the World Wildlife Fund's Rio Grande Program.",
      "He pointed to Colorado, where water managers have threatened to shut off groundwater wells if the aquifer that supports irrigated farms cannot be stabilized. There, farmers who pump groundwater pay fees that are used to incentivize other farmers to fallow their fields.",
      "New Mexico's fallowing program is voluntary, but changes could be in store if the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on proposed settlements stemming from a long-running dispute with Texas and the federal government over management of the Rio Grande and groundwater use. New Mexico has acknowledged it will have to curb groundwater pumping.",
      "New Mexico is behind in its water deliveries to Texas under an interstate compact, while Mexico owes water to the U.S. under a 1944 binational treaty. Researchers said meeting those obligations won't get easier.",
      "Prunes said policymakers must also consider the environment when crafting solutions.",
      "\u201cRebalancing the system also means maintaining those basic functions that the river and the aquifers and the groundwater-dependent ecosystems have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the indicator of resilience to a future of less water.\u201d",

      "Meta has started notifying young Australians to download their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia\u2019s population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \u201cvideo selfie,\u201d Meta said.",

      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Failure to take reasonable steps to exclude young children could earn platforms fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($32 million).",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",

      "The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.\"",
      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "Another company, Miko, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",
      "\u201cWe are always expanding our internal testing, strengthening our filters, and introducing new capabilities that detect and block sensitive or unexpected topics,\" said CEO Sneh Vaswani. \u201cThese new features complement our existing controls that allow parents and caregivers to identify specific topics they\u2019d like to restrict from conversation.

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA unveiled close-up pictures on Wednesday of the interstellar comet that\u2019s making a quick one-and-done tour of the solar system.",
      "Discovered over the summer, the comet known as 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed object to visit our corner of the cosmos from another star. It zipped harmlessly past Mars last month.",
      "Three NASA spacecraft on and near the red planet zoomed in on the comet as it passed just 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) away, revealing a fuzzy white blob. The European Space Agency's two satellites around Mars also made observations.",
      "Other NASA spacecraft will remain on the lookout in the weeks ahead, including the Webb Space Telescope. At the same time, astronomers are aiming their ground telescopes at the approaching comet, which is about 190 million miles (307 million kilometers) from Earth. The Virtual Telescope Project's Gianluca Masi zoomed in Wednesday from Italy.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\u201cEveryone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" said NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman.",
      "The closest the comet will come to Earth is 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) in mid-December. Then it will hightail it back into interstellar space, never to return.",
      "ESA\u2019s Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won\u2019t get any of these observations back until February because Juice\u2019s main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it\u2019s near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",

Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \u201cwhich gives me goose bumps to think about,\u201d said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\u201cThat means that 3I/Atlas is not just a window into another solar system, it\u2019s a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

      "The records request concerned the July decision not to release the files.",
      "The Department of Justice is facing new scrutiny over the decision to withhold the Jeffrey Epstein files earlier this year.",
      "A federal judge on Monday ordered the DOJ to expedite processing of a Freedom of Information Act request related to the Trump administration\u2019s decision in July not to release files from the investigation of Epstein.",
      "With the DOJ already facing a Dec. 19 deadline to turn over the Epstein files, as mandated by the\u00a0Epstein Files Transparency Act, the ruling could shed light on why the Trump administration reversed course on its earlier vow to release the files. A joint FBI and DOJ memo in July concluded there was \u201cno basis to revisit the disclosure of those materials\u201d and that their review \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Progressive legal nonprofit Democracy Forward brought the lawsuit after the Justice Department \"constructively denied its expedited review request\" regarding the internal records, according to the ruling, including whether Attorney General Pam Bondi \u201cmisled the American people in representing that the \u2018client list\u2019 was on her desk and ready for review,\u201d and whether the DOJ \u201creversed course on the decision to disclose the Epstein matter case files out of a desire to cover-up the content within.\u201d Specifically, the FOIA request sought records that might show that the reported mention of Trump\u2019s name in the files prompted the reversal.",
      "Judge Tanya Chutkan \u2013 who oversaw Trump\u2019s criminal case related to his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election result \u2013 ruled on Monday that Democracy Forward demonstrated that their request was reasonably tailored to a \"matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity that affect public confidence,\u201d clearing the legal bar to order expedited processing.",
      "\u201cThe request for \u2018records reflecting all correspondence between Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey Epstein\u2019 is plainly tied to the concern discussed in the media that the Justice Department reversed its position on the disclosure of the Epstein documents only after Attorney General Bondi reportedly informed the President that his name appeared in the files,\u201d Judge Chutkan wrote.",
      "In the same ruling, Judge Chutkan partially denied Democracy Forward\u2019s request for records mentioning \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and \u201cflight logs\u201d \u2013 concluding that those terms were overbroad \u2013 but granted the bulk of their request.",

      "Burt Meyer, the inventor behind iconic toys like Rock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots, Lite-Brite, and MouseTrap, has died at age 99",
      "Burt Meyer, who invented toys like Rock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots, Lite-Brite and MouseTrap in the 1960s that delighted generations of children, has died. He was 99.",
      "Meyer\u2019s creations arrived in the postwar boom, when plastic molding and mass production transformed how American kids played. That shift opened the door for more dynamic toys, and Meyer seized the moment with designs that would stay on shelves for decades.",
      "Meyer died on Oct. 30, said Rebecca Mathis, executive director at King-Bruwaert House, a retirement community in Burr Ridge, Illinois, where he lived.",
      "Meyer succeeded by straddling two often conflicting worlds, carrying a boundless childlike imagination alongside a pragmatic understanding of machines.",
      "The idea for Lite-Brite came in 1966 when Meyer was walking in Manhattan with Marvin Glass, who owned one of the largest toy design companies at the time, and the two men passed a window display featuring hundreds of colored lights. Engineers at the company doubted that electic lights could be safely adapted for children, according to Tim Walsh, who interviewed Meyer for his 2005 book \u201cTimeless Toys.\u201d",
      "Meyer, an employee at Marvin Glass & Associates, insisted it could.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s billions of ideas out there,\u201d Walsh wrote, \u201cbut executing them into a final creative solution is often the hard part.\u201d",
      "Meyer came up with a small backlit box and black paper sheets that allowed kids to create illuminated patterns. Lite-Brite was a hit, earning spots on Time Magazine\u2019s list of 100 greatest toys and in the Strong National Museum of Play\u2019s hall of fame. New versions are still being sold.",
      "Meyer had a similar role with a design team that reimagined a bulky boxing arcade game for home use. The original concept stalled in development after a featherweight boxer died from a brain injury, making any toy that invoked the tragedy unmarketable, company leaders thought.",
      "Meyer revisited the idea with a simple shift. \u201cThis is too good to pass up,\u201d he recalled saying in a 2010 interview. \u201cLet\u2019s take it away from humanity, let\u2019s make it robots. And we won\u2019t have them fall over, we\u2019ll have something funny happen.\u201d",
      "The result was Rock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots, a small game where players control the fighters\u2019 fists by pressing buttons on joysticks. A player wins by hitting the jaw of the opposing robot, theatrically popping up the spring-loaded head.",

The company developed numerous best-sellers including Gooey Louie, where children picked boogers our of Louie\u2019s nose, and the Pretty Pretty Princess board game. His son, Steve Meyer, ran the business until 2006, according to The New York Times.",

After retiring from toy making, he moved to Downers Grove, a suburb of Chicago, where he built small planes and could be seen deftly steering them aloft from a nearby private airfield well into his 80s.",
      "In interviews, Meyer often drew parallels between aerospace engineering and toy design, saying both required ingenutity and teamwork.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re flying the airplane, use every resource that you have in there. That\u2019s why we were able to turn out so many successful products,\u201d Meyer said, crediting his success to the highly collaborative environment at Marvin Glass & Associates.",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Shut down for more than six years, part of a scenic road loop in North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park will reopen Tuesday, giving visitors a better opportunity to see wildlife and panoramic views of the rugged Badlands.",
      "The park's 21-mile (34-kilometer) loop encircles a stark landscape where the 26th president wandered as a young man in the 1880s. The area includes colorful bluffs, dramatic formations from erosion and petrified tree stumps. Visitors enjoy encountering prairie dogs, bison and wild horses on the road.",
      "Storms, the erosive landscape and aging infrastructure caused a 150-foot (45-meter) section of roadway to slump in spring 2019, with sinkholes and other problems occurring later on the road, the National Park Service said. Since then, visitors have had to turn around at a certain point, unable to see views such as Scoria Point Overlook, a vista of red rock and rolling hills.",
      "\u201cIt's a nice, scenic place. It's been missed,\u201d said Chris Kman, a local souvenir shop owner who also leads park tours.",
      "Scoria Point is one of her top spots in the park, the site of her favorite photo with her husband. A popular nature trail is nearby. The road closure later enveloped another pull-off, Badlands Overlook, with a view where \u201cthe sky goes on forever,\u201d Kman said.",
      "The road is scheduled to reopen Tuesday, U.S. Sen. John Hoeven said. Construction lasted about two and a half years on a 6-mile (10-kilometer) closed segment, ending in October.",
      "The work encompassed full road reconstruction, drainage improvements, slope reconstruction and grading, and pavement resurfacing, the Park Service said.",
      "\u201cThere's just an incredible amount of engineering that's gone into it because you're building this road on the side of these steep bluffs,\u201d said Hoeven, R-N.D.",
      "Visitors will see stone riprap, wire suspension and concrete work holding the road in place and blending into the natural terrain, he said.",

      "The closed road segment dates to the Great Depression, when the Civilian Conservation Corps developed the area that became the national park. The scenic loop was completed in 1968.",
      "The road project needed more money because of continuing failures of the soil under the road, contract bids higher than budget estimates and erosive storms, the park service said. Long winters and short summers limited construction, and rain and winter weather took a toll as well, the agency said.",
      "Fully opening the loop road means the park will be completely accessible when the nearby Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library holds its grand opening July 4. Organizers expect the library, once opened, will draw hundreds of thousands of people.",

Some research indicates that holiday meals could cost more this year, despite the president\u2019s insistence otherwise, a reminder of persistent frustration with elevated prices.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is struggling to advance a plan to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine after an earlier version faced swift criticism from European allies and even some Republicans. The U.S. military is also poised to target Venezuela with military strikes, part of an anti-drug operation that could ultimately destabilize the country's leadership.",
      "In Washington, Trump faces the possibility of a splintering Republican coalition ahead of next year's midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. Some members of his party already took the rare step of crossing the president by successfully pushing legislation to force the Justice Department to release more documents about the Jeffrey Epstein case.",

Although holiday tours are expected to continue, Trump's decision to demolish the building's East Wing to make room for a new ballroom has turned part of the White House grounds into a construction site.",

      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation are announcing a strategic partnership",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the most storied American philanthropies is teaming up with the internet's biggest creator to instill young people with a concern for what they call the world's \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d populations.",
      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced a strategic partnership Monday. The idea is to pair Donaldson's unique ability to capture youth attention spans with the foundation's 112-year history of using its resources and technology to tackle global problems.",
      "Speaking together ahead of a Nov. 21 video shoot at MrBeast's Greenville, North Carolina, studio, the partners complimented the respective strengths they hope to exchange with each other.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life making YouTube videos. They\u2019ve spent their entire lives helping people,\" Donaldson told The Associated Press. \"Obviously, they have a team who\u2019s way more experienced than me in helping people, but being able to pull on their knowledge and wisdom is amazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want to download their brains into our team\u2019s brains,\" he added.",
      "Dr. Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the philanthropic sector has long failed to capture \u201cthe hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of young people.\u201d He said MrBeast can help them engage young people, inspire hope and communicate their work more accessibly.",
      "Most people have a natural desire to help others, according to Shah, but we teach ourselves that world problems are \u201ctoo big and too complicated\u201d to solve. He pointed to MrBeast's video in Zambia, where they provided a village with solar-powered electricity and clean water wells.",
      "\"What Jimmy\u2019s already done is show that you can change that dramatically,\u201d Shah said. \"If we can get people believing that they can make a difference through this collaboration, we will have achieved something really unique and really special.\u201d",
      "The move signals Donaldson's continued attempts to evolve an organization with sprawling interests that include an entertainment studio, food brands, his own James Patterson book deal and, most recently, a limited time theme park in Saudi Arabia. He brought on venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold as CEO last year and then hired more new executives as a series of controversies threatened his ambitions ahead of his Amazon Prime reality game show 's release.",
      "It's an unlikely marriage to some. The Rockefeller Foundation is a pillar of civil society established with wealth amassed by the 19th-century oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller during the Gilded Age whereas the 27-year-old Donaldson represents the 21st century \u201cinfluencer\u201d economy where entire media empires can emerge from content creators' viral stunts and the online buzz they generate.",
      "Shah acknowledged that the Rockefeller Foundation rarely does corporate partnerships. But he said that spending time with Donaldson and his mother, as well as watching his philanthropically minded videos, communicated the YouTube megastar's \u201cpersonal commitment to philanthropy\u201d and the \u201csense of enthusiasm one can experience when you help others.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe bring innovation, a sense of purpose and a deep commitment to measuring results to those efforts. And, over time, it\u2019s literally helped hundreds of millions of people escape poverty, hunger and disease,\" Shah said. \u201cI just think Jimmy, and the enterprise he\u2019s built and the perspective that he brings, is totally consistent with that.\u201d",
      "The exact issues they plan to tackle together are still being hammered out and there is no shared grantmaking to announce yet. But Shah mentioned that the Rockefeller Foundation has a long history of combatting child hunger and noted Beast Philanthropy\u2019s video on a school meal program.",
      "Already, though, they have started working to combat child labor in the cocoa industry.",
      "Through his snack company, Feastables, Donaldson says he wants to prove that chocolate can be profitable without using child labor on cacao farms. He hopes to provide farmers with living incomes, create stable economic conditions so children can go to school instead of farms and use his YouTube channel to rally consumers around fair-trade practices.",

      "\u201cViolence is a part of America\u2019s culture,\u201d Brown said during a 1967 news conference. \u201c... America taught the black people to be violent. We will use that violence to rid ourselves of oppression, if necessary. We will be free by any means necessary.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- Viola Ford Fletcher, who as one of the last survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma spent her later years seeking justice for the deadly attack by a white mob on the thriving Black community where she lived as a child, has died. She was 111.",
      "Her grandson Ike Howard said Monday that she died surrounded by family at a Tulsa hospital. Sustained by a strong faith, she raised three children, worked as a welder in a shipyard during World War II and spent decades caring for families as a housekeeper.",

      "She was 7 years old when the two-day attack began on Tulsa\u2019s Greenwood district on May 31, 1921, after a local newspaper published a sensationalized report about a Black man accused of assaulting a white woman. As a white mob grew outside the courthouse, Black Tulsans with guns who hoped to prevent the man\u2019s lynching began showing up. White residents responded with overwhelming force. Hundreds of people were killed and homes were burned and looted, leaving over 30 city blocks decimated in the prosperous community known as Black Wall Street.",
      "\u201cI could never forget the charred remains of our once-thriving community, the smoke billowing in the air, and the terror-stricken faces of my neighbors,\u201d she wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Them Bury My Story.\u201d",
      "As her family left in a horse-drawn buggy, her eyes burned from the smoke and ash, she wrote. She described seeing piles of bodies in the streets and watching as a white man shot a Black man in the head, then fired toward her family.",
      "She told The Associated Press in an interview the year her memoir was published that fear of reprisals influenced her years of near-silence about the massacre. She wrote the book with Howard, her grandson, who said he had to persuade her to tell her story.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want history to repeat itself so we do need to educate people about what happened and try to get people to understand why you need to be made whole, why you need to be repaired,\u201d Howard told the AP in 2024. \u201cThe generational wealth that was lost, the home, all the belongings, everything was lost in one night.\u201d",
      "The attack went largely unremembered for decades. In Oklahoma, wider discussions began when the state formed a commission in 1997 to investigate the violence.",
      "Fletcher, who in 2021 testified before Congress about what she went through, joined her younger brother, Hughes Van Ellis, and another massacre survivor, Lessie Benningfield Randle, in a lawsuit seeking reparations. The Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed it in June 2024, saying their grievances did not fall within the scope of the state\u2019s public nuisance statute.",
      "\u201cFor as long as we remain in this lifetime, we will continue to shine a light on one of the darkest days in American history,\u201d Fletcher and Randle said in a statement at the time. Van Ellis had died a year earlier, at the age of 102.",

      "A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests, compounding strains on the busy local court system and an already overcrowded jail in ways that concerned officials say will last months or even years as cases play out.",
      "Since late September, hundreds of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel tied to the Memphis Safe Task Force have made traffic stops, served warrants and searched for fugitives in the city of about 610,000 people. More than 2,800 people have been arrested and more than 28,000 traffic citations have been issued, data provided by the task force and Memphis police shows.",
      "The task force, which includes National Guard troops, is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others who hope the surge reduces crime in a city that has grappled with violent crime, including nearly 300 homicides last year and nearly 400 in 2023.",
      "From 2018 to 2024, homicides in Memphis increased 33% and aggravated assaults rose 41%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crimes across the country using local law enforcement data for its Real-Time Crime Index. But AH Datalytics reported those numbers were down 20% during the first nine months of this year, even before the task force got to work.",
      "Opponents of the task force in majority-Black Memphis say it targets minorities and intimidates law-abiding Latinos, some of whom have skipped work and changed social habits, such as avoiding going to church or restaurants, fearing they will be harassed and unfairly detained. Statistics released at the end of October showed 319 arrests so far on administrative warrants, which deal with immigration-related issues.",
      "The effects have rippled beyond the streets, into the aging criminal courthouse and the troubled jail. Officials are concerned about long waits in traffic court causing people to miss work and packed criminal court dockets forcing inmates to spend extra days waiting for bail hearings.",
      "\u201cThe human cost of it is astounding,\" said Josh Spickler, executive director for Just City, a Memphis-based organization that advocates for fairness in the criminal justice system.",
      "The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has requested more judges to hear cases that could span months or years. County officials are discussing opening court at night and on weekends, a move that would help manage the caseload but cost more.",
      "Meanwhile, Shelby County Jail inmates are being moved to other facilities because of overcrowding, officials say. Inmates at jail intake are sleeping in chairs, and jail officials are asking county commissioners for funding to help address problems, such as a corrections employees shortage.",
      "These issues raise concerns from activists and officials about safety in a jail that has seen 65 deaths since 2019, according to Just City. Court case backlogs mean defendants and crime victims could spend an unfair amount of time dealing with the criminal justice system, said Steve Mulroy, the county's district attorney.",
      "\u201cThe task force deployment probably could have used more planning,\u201d said Mulroy, a Democrat whose office is cooperating with the task force. \u201cMore thought could have been put into the downstream effects of the increased arrest numbers.\u201d",
      "There were hundreds more jail bookings and bail settings during the first several weeks of the task force\u2019s operation than during the comparable period last year, an increase of about 40% in each category, according to county statistics.",
      "The jail, which has a regular capacity of 2,400, had an average daily population of 3,195 inmates in September, the most recent month when statistics were available. County officials said that number was expected to rise for October.",
      "As of mid-November, 250 overflow jail detainees were being housed at other facilities, compared with 80 in November 2024. Some of those are outside Shelby County, which makes it harder for lawyers and relatives to visit and increases the cost of bringing defendants to Memphis for hearings.",
      "In a letter to commissioners, Chief Jailer Kirk Fields has requested at least $1.5 million in emergency funds, noting that more inmates means more expenses for food, clothing, bedding and linens.",
      "One issue is whether there are enough judges to hear cases, especially after lawmakers eliminated two judgeships during last year's session.",

      "The federal agency that oversees the security of election systems was largely absent from planning before elections this month in several states",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Since it was created in 2018, the federal government's cybersecurity agency has helped warn state and local election officials about potential threats from foreign governments, showed officials how to protect polling places from attacks and gamed out how to respond to the unexpected, such as an Election Day bomb threat or sudden disinformation campaign",
      "The agency was largely absent from that space for elections this month in several states, a potential preview for the 2026 midterms. Shifting priorities of the Trump administration, staffing reductions and budget cuts have many election officials concerned about how engaged the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will be next year, when control of Congress will be at stake in those elections.",
      "Some officials say they have begun scrambling to fill the anticipated gaps.",
      "\u201cWe do not have a sense of whether we can rely on CISA for these services as we approach a big election year in 2026,\u201d said Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who until recently led the bipartisan National Association of Secretaries of State.",
      "The association's leaders sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February asking her to preserve the cybersecurity agency's core election functions. Noem, whose department oversees the agency, has yet to reply.",
      "\u201cI regret to say that months later, the letter remains very timely and relevant,\u201d Simon said.",
      "CISA, as the agency is known, was formed under the first Trump administration to help safeguard the nation's critical infrastructure, from dams and power plants to election systems. It has been undergoing a major transformation since President Donald Trump's second term began in January.",
      "Public records suggest that roughly 1,000 CISA employees have lost their jobs over the past years. The Republican administration in March cut $10 million from two cybersecurity initiatives, including one dedicated to helping state and local election officials.",
      "That was a few weeks after CISA announced it was conducting a review of its election-related work, and more than a dozen staffers who have worked on elections were placed on administrative leave. The FBI also disbanded a task force on foreign influence operations, including those that target U.S. elections.",
      "CISA is still without an official director. Trump\u2019s nomination of Sean Plankey, a cybersecurity expert in the first Trump administration, has stalled in the Senate.",
      "CISA officials did not answer questions seeking specifics about the agency's role in the recently completed elections, its plans for the 2026 election cycle or staffing levels. They said the agency remains ready to help protect election infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUnder the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, CISA is laser-focused on securing America\u2019s critical infrastructure and strengthening cyber resilience across the government and industry,\u201d said Marci McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "She said CISA would announce its future organizational plans \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d",

      "\u201cOver the past year, CISA\u2019s capacity to support elections has been significantly diminished,\" the California secretary of state\u2019s office said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"The agency has experienced major reductions in staffing, funding, and mission focus \u2014 including the elimination of personnel dedicated specifically to election security and foreign influence mitigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis shift has left election officials nationwide without the critical federal partnership they have relied on for several election cycles,\u201d according to the office.",
      "CISA alerted California officials in September that it would no longer participate in a task force that brought together federal, state and local agencies to support county election offices. California election officials and the governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services did what they could to fill the gaps and plan for various security scenarios.",
      "In Orange County, California, the registrar of voters, Bob Page, said in an email that the state offices and other county departments \u201cstepped up\u201d to support his office \u201cto fill the void left by CISA\u2019s absence.\u201d",
      "Neighboring Los Angeles County had a different experience. The registrar's office, which oversees elections, said it continues to get a range of cybersecurity services from CISA, including threat intelligence, network monitoring and security testing of its equipment, although local jurisdictions now have to cover the costs of some services that had been federally funded.",
      "Some other states that held elections this month also said they did not have coordination with CISA.",
      "Mississippi's secretary of state, who heads the national association that sent the letter to Noem, did not directly respond to a request for comment, but his office confirmed that CISA was not involved in the state\u2019s recent elections.",
      "In Pennsylvania, which held a nationally watched retention election for three state Supreme Court justices, the Department of State said it is also relied more on its own partners to ensure the elections were secure.",
      "In an email, the department said it was \u201crelying much less on CISA than it had in recent years.\u201d Instead, it has begun collaborating with the state police, the state's own homeland security department, local cybersecurity experts and other agencies.",
      "Simon, the former head of the secretary of state's association, said state and local election officials need answers about CISA\u2019s plans because officials will have to seek alternatives if the services it had been providing will not be available next year.",
      "In some cases, such as classified intelligence briefings, there are no alternatives to the federal government, he said. But there might be ways to get other services, such as testing of election equipment to see if it can be penetrated from outside.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and leaders of Philadelphia\u2019s mass transit agency said Monday that the system is fully complying with federal orders to take measures to help prevent fires in an aging electric railcar model that is heavily used in its regional rail fleet.",
      "The October order from the Federal Railroad Administration came after federal transportation authorities investigated five fires this year involving the Silverliner IV passenger railcars used by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he is sending an extra $220 million in state aid to SEPTA to help it comply with the orders. SEPTA said that, starting Monday, some of the 225 Silverliner IV cars will return to service for the first time since October.",
      "All five fires forced everyone aboard to evacuate \u2014 in one case, as many as 350 passengers \u2014 with a few minor injuries reported. One railcar was involved in two of the fires, and two other railcars were destroyed, the National Transportation Safety Board has said.",
      "SEPTA is one of the nation\u2019s largest mass transit agencies, carrying 800,000 daily riders on buses, trolleys and rail. It blames inadequate public funding for a backlog of upgrades of more than $10 billion.",
      "The recommendation comes at a time when SEPTA and major transit agencies around the U.S. are fighting for more public funding as they struggle with rising costs and lagging ridership.",
      "In its report, the NTSB was critical of SEPTA\u2019s maintenance and operating practices.",

      "The Silverliner IV rail cars represent about two-thirds of SEPTA\u2019s regional rail fleet and date back to the mid-1970s. They are SEPTA\u2019s oldest rail cars, the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is promoting efforts to work with Nigeria\u2019s government to counter violence against Christians",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration is promoting efforts to work with Nigeria's government to counter violence against Christians, signaling a broader strategy since he ordered preparations for possible military action and warned that the United States could go in \u201cguns-a-blazing\u201d to wipe out Islamic militants.",
      "A State Department official said this past week that plans involve much more than just the potential use of military force, describing an expansive approach that includes diplomatic tools, such as potential sanctions, but also assistance programs and intelligence sharing with the Nigerian government.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also met with Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser to discuss ways to stop the violence, posting photos on social media of the two of them shaking hands and smiling. It contrasted with Trump\u2019s threats this month to stop all assistance to Nigeria if its government \u201ccontinues to allow the killing of Christians.\u201d",
      "The efforts may support Trump\u2019s pledge to avoid more involvement in foreign conflicts and come as the U.S. security footprint has diminished in Africa, where military partnerships have either been scaled down or canceled. American forces likely would have to be drawn from other parts of the world for any military intervention in Nigeria.",
      "Still, the Republican president has kept up the pressure as Nigeria faced a series of attacks on schools and churches in violence that experts and residents say targets both Christians and Muslims.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really angry about it,\u201d the president said Friday when asked about the new violence on the \u201cBrian Kilmeade Show\u201d on Fox News Radio. He alleged that Nigeria's government has \u201cdone nothing\u201d and said \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Nigeria is a disgrace.\u201d",
      "The Nigerian government has rejected his claims.",
      "Following his meeting Thursday with Nigerian national security adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, Hegseth on Friday posted on social media that the Pentagon is \u201cworking aggressively with Nigeria to end the persecution of Christians by jihadist terrorists.\u201d",
      "\u201cHegseth emphasized the need for Nigeria to demonstrate commitment and take both urgent and enduring action to stop violence against Christians and conveyed the Department\u2019s desire to work by, with, and through Nigeria to deter and degrade terrorists that threaten the United States,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement.",
      "Jonathan Pratt, who leads the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, told lawmakers Thursday that \u201cpossible Department of War engagement\u201d is part of the larger plan, while the issue has been discussed by the National Security Council, an arm of the White House that advises the president on national security and foreign policy.",
      "But Pratt described a wide-ranging approach at a congressional hearing about Trump\u2019s recent designation of Nigeria as \u201ca country of particular concern\u201d over religious freedom, which opens the door for sanctions.",
      "\u201cThis would span from security to policing to economic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to look at all of these tools and have a comprehensive strategy to get the best result possible.\u201d",
      "The violence in Nigeria is far more complex than Trump has portrayed, with militant Islamist groups like Boko Haram killing both Christians and Muslims. At the same time, mainly Muslim herders and mostly Christian farmers have been fighting over land and water. Armed bandits who are motivated more by money than religion also are carrying out abductions for ransom, with schools being a popular target.",
      "In two mass abductions at schools this past week, students were kidnapped from a Catholic school Friday and others taken days earlier from a school in a Muslim-majority town. In a separate attack, gunmen killed two people at a church and abducted several worshippers.",
      "The situation has drawn increasing global attention. Rapper Nicki Minaj spoke at a U.N. event organized by the U.S., saying \u201cno group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion.\u201d",
      "If the Trump administration did decide to organize an intervention, the departure of U.S. forces from neighboring Niger and their forced eviction from a French base near Chad\u2019s capital last year have left fewer resources in the region.",

      "Addressing the violence would require programs such as economic and interfaith partnerships as well as more robust policing, Devermont said, adding that U.S. involvement would require Nigeria\u2019s cooperation.",
      "\u201cThis is not a policy of neglect by the Nigerian government \u2014 it\u2019s a problem of capacity,\u201d Devermont said. \u201cThe federal government does not want to see its citizens being killed by Boko Haram and doesn\u2019t want to see sectarian violence spiral out the way it has.\u201d",

Trump called Mamdani a \u201c100% Communist Lunatic\u201d in a social media post following the incoming mayor's election victory, and Mamdani has said Trump was attacking democracy.

    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

      "Donald Glover is opening up about a recent health scare that forced him to cancel his tour last year. At the time, he described it as an \"ailment,\" but Glover said Saturday night at a performance that a doctor told him he'd had a stroke.",
      "Glover, who performs under the moniker Childish Gambino, shared the information on stage at Tyler, the Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Los Angeles. His remarks were shared widely on social media.",
      "\"You guys voted for a 'where have I been monologue,'\" Glover, 42, said. \"I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway. I couldn't really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, 'You had a stroke.'\"",
      "Glover said he felt like he was letting everyone down, lamenting that he still hasn't been to Ireland. He also revealed that \"they found a hole\" in his heart and he had to have two surgeries.",
      "\"They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realize you have one,\" Glover said. \"You got one life, guys, and I gotta be honest, the life I've lived with you guys has been such a blessing.\"",

    "summary": "Lea Michele, the \"Glee\" star who made her Broadway debut in \"Les Miserables\" at age eight, is now back in the same Broadway theater starring in \"Chess: The Musical.\"",
    "story": [
      "In 1965, the original musical \"Funny Girl\" was playing at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre, starring someone who knew her way around a song. That same year, a guy named Joe Allen opened a place a few blocks away. It was the place to be for Broadway stars like Al Pacino and a host of others. Plus, they served a mean cheeseburger.",
      "The cheeseburgers are still there, and so are Broadway's elite. Lea Michele has been coming here since her Broadway debut in the 1990s. \"I just love this place so much,\" she said.",
      "And what would she eat? \"A burger. I mean, it's always so good, so good here, oh my God,\" she said.",
      "But when we met her at Joe Allen's, she wasn't in a burger mood, because she had a show to do. Lea Michele is currently starring in the musical \"Chess.\" In the show, she plays a brilliant strategist for two world champion chess players (played by Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher).",
      "\"Chess\" is a love triangle, a spectacle, and a chance for the stars to raise the roof at the Imperial Theatre \u2013 the same place where Michele made her Broadway debut in 1995 in \"Les Miserables,\" at the age of eight.",
      "Her parents weren't show biz people \u2013 Dad owned a deli \u2013 and before she auditioned, they had no clue their daughter could sing. \"And as we were leaving, I turned to my Mom and I was like, 'I'm gonna get this. I think I'm gonna get this,'\" Michele recalled. \"And she said, 'Things like that don't happen to people like us.'\"",
      "In this case, Mom was wrong: Michele got the part, and went on to even greater heights in the musical \"Spring Awakening,\" and later became a household name in the hit TV show \"Glee.\"",
      "She hit a few bumps along the way, among them a difficult pregnancy with her first child in 2020, and flak on social media that she acted like a diva back in the \"Glee\" days. But things looked up in 2023, when she was asked to step into the shoes of her idol Barbra Streisand, and take over a struggling revival of \"Funny Girl.\"",
      "She said, \"I think that we all grow as we get older. It's hard being in an industry where there is such a spotlight on these phases and times in your life.\"",
      "And what was the pressure like to take over \"Funny Girl\"? It was the first time that I was really sort of in the spotlight after everything that had happened to me personally,\" Michele said. \"I wanted to finally show everyone that I could play this part, and play her really well.\"",
      "Long story short, Michele killed it, and turned a sinking show into a hit, despite suffering a miscarriage during her run. And when she was approached about doing \"Chess,\" she told producers that having another baby came first.\u00a0 \"And so my husband and I ended up doing IVF, which was in its own right very intense and challenging,\" she said. \"But you know, we got pregnant and had our daughter, who is wonderful and wild. And then they, you know, said, 'Would you like to do the show?' 'Absolutely!'\"",
      "Now, the 39-year-old mother of two is back at the Imperial Theatre, where it all began, serving up another knockout performance with a side of gratitude.",
      "I asked, \"What do you think that eight-year-old girl would think, back in that same theatre?\"",
      "\"I think that she'd be so proud, and she would just say, 'Thank you,' 'cause that's all she wanted,\" Michele said. \"And it's still what I want. My love for what I do was definitely reignited during 'Funny Girl.' And I'm very grateful for that. But I'm so happy to be here, and to be home.\"",

      "Footage shows Erivo and others on the red carpet comforting Grande.",
      "Wen was arrested hours later and charged with \"being a public nuisance.\" Last week, a court sentenced him to nine days in jail.",
      "After the incident, Wen shared a video on Instagram and thanked Grande for \"letting (him) jump on the Yellow Carpet\" with her.",

      "Wen, who is alleged to have disrupted other global sports events and concerts, \"showed a pattern of behaviour\" which suggested that he will do it again, the judge had said before last week's ruling. The jail term was far below the maximum penalty afforded by law: three months in jail, a fine of $1,500, or both.",

      "\"Before we started shooting, both of us had a conversation about making sure that we would take care of each other and make the space that we needed for each other, and take, you know, give each other what we needed, be generous with each other in this thing, because we knew it was a big undertaking,\" Erivo said. \"We knew we had a big responsibility, but we knew neither of us could really do that alone.\"",

    "summary": "Rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to the 2012 Obama campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "summary": "British singer Lily Allen tells Anthony Mason about heartbreak and healing in her only TV interview about her new album, \"West End Girl.\"",
    "story": [
      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

    "summary": "The impact of the Republicans' tax and spending law could result in the \"largest refund season of the last decade,\" a Wall Street report says.",
    "story": [
      "Federal tax refunds often represent a family's single largest check of the year, and next year's refunds could be even bigger, with the average payment set to increase by about $1,000 per filer, according to a recent analysis from financial services company Piper Sandler.",
      "That could boost the typical refund check to roughly $4,151 per filer, based on IRS data that shows the average tax refund was $3,151 for the 2025 tax filing season. Americans will file their 2025 individual returns in early 2026, with most people receiving their refunds within 21 days of submitting their forms to the tax agency.",
      "The analysis aligns with other forecasts predicting a bumper year for tax refunds, driven by the \"one big, beautiful\" tax and spending law signed by President Trump in July. The legislation enacted a bevy of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025, including eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "\"When people go to file, they'll be surprised by really, really large refunds,\" Don Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler and one of the report's authors, said in a recent podcast about the analysis. \"In a typical year, we might have about $270 billion in tax refunds, and it'll be that plus another $90 billion.\"",
      "Americans generally aren't adjusting their withholding to reflect the new law's retroactive tax cuts, largely because it's hard for employees to estimate the impact, Schneider added. As a result, when people file their taxes in early 2026, their refunds could be about one-third larger than usual \u2014 that amounts to roughly an extra $1,000 per filer, according to the report's calculations.",
      "\"It could be one of the largest tax refund seasons ever,\" Schneider added.",
      "Still, the impact won't be evenly distributed, with the benefits largely going toward middle- and upper-middle-income households, or those earning between $60,000 to $400,000 per year, according to Piper Sandler.",
      "That echoes earlier tax analyses projecting that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. People who earn over $217,000 a year are likely to get $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the law, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Some of the law's benefits won't reach the highest-earning households because of income phase-outs, Piper Sandler noted. For example, the new $40,000 SALT deduction begins to phase out for filers with annual income of more than $500,000.",
      "The lowest-earning households are also likely to see little benefit from parts of the new tax law. For instance, the higher SALT deduction cap only helps people whose state and local taxes exceed the 2025 standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples.",
      "Because filers must itemize to claim the SALT deduction, lower-income households typically can't take advantage of it, according to tax experts.",
      "\"This isn't going to the very bottom of the distribution. It isn't going to the very top of the distribution either,\" Scheider said.",

      "Pascal Perrin, an art historian and Renoir expert, lauded the \"exceptional condition of the work, which has undergone no restoration,\" while presenting the canvas.",
      "\"We were particularly surprised by how fresh the painting was,\" Perrin told PBS earlier this month. \"In other words, it is a painting that has retained all of its colors perfectly, which has not been recanvassed, retouched or revarnished.\"",
      "Jean Renoir, born in 1894, went on to receive a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975, several years before he died at the age of 84. His works include the 1930s classic \"La Grande Illusion,\" which follows two French prisoners of war trying to escape German captivity during World War I.",
      "The painting of him as a child had been valued at 1-1.5 million euros and was acquired by an \"international buyer,\" Drouot said on Tuesday.",
      "\"It is exceptional because, first of all, it is a masterclass of intimacy,\" auctioneer Christophe Joron-Derem told PBS. \"We see this very tender relationship between Jean and Gabrielle, who knows how to control the child so that Renoir can paint him.\"",
      "The high-end art market has dipped in recent years, but lately, record-breaking sales have indicated a revival in demand.",
      "A self-portrait by celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo sold for $54.66 million in New York last week, a record for a painting by a woman, two nights after a Gustav Klimt canvas fetched $236.4 million \u2014 a record for a modern art piece.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nursing-professional-degree-excluded-list/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:40:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The department also said in a\u00a0fact sheet that its definition of a professional degree is used to distinguish programs that qualify for higher loan limits from one another, and is \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

      "A lawsuit filed in Michigan last week alleges that a Campbell Soup Company executive made offensive comments about Indian workers and said the company's products were for \"poor people\" during a conversation with a former employee.",
      "The suit was filed by Robert Garza, who was hired by Campbell's as a cybersecurity analyst in September 2024.",
      "Garza alleges that Campbell's executive Martin Bally made the offensive remarks during a meeting in November 2024, which was intended to discuss his salary. According to the lawsuit, Bally made several comments about Indian workers and said that Campbell's is \"highly [processed] food\" for \"poor people.\"",
      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",
      "Garza was then \"abruptly terminated from employment\" just weeks later, the lawsuit says. The discussion between Garza and Bally was recorded, according to Detroit television station WDIV.",
      "James Regan, a Campbell's spokesperson, said the company was not aware of the recording before it aired on WDIV on Thursday and doesn't know if it's legitimate.",
      "Bally is one of many vice presidents at Campbell's, according to Regan. His\u00a0LinkedIn lists his title as vice president and chief information security officer.",
      "\"The person alleged to be speaking on the recording works in IT and has nothing to do with how we make our food,\" Campbell's said in a statement to CBS News. The company also said Bally is temporarily on leave while the company conducts an investigation.",

      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

      "Jeff and Wendy Dennis were running errands when the Tesla suddenly accelerated for at least five seconds. Jeff Dennis swerved to miss other vehicles before the car hit the utility pole and burst into flames, the lawsuit says.",
      "The automatic emergency braking system did not engage before hitting the pole, the lawsuit alleges, even though it is designed to apply the brakes when a frontal collision is considered unavoidable.",
      "Bystanders couldn't open the doors because the handles do not work from the outside because they also rely on battery power to operate.. The doors also couldn't be opened from inside because the battery had shut off because of the fire, and a manual override button is hard to find and use, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The heat from the fire prevented bystanders from getting close enough to try to break out the windows.",
      "Defective battery chemistry and battery pack design unnecessarily increased the risk of a catastrophic fire after the impact with the pole, the lawsuit alleges.",

    "story": [
      "Some batteries that power a popular brand of e-bike pose a fire hazard that can cause serious injury or death and shouldn't be used, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said in a\u00a0notice Monday.",
      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",
      "Rad Power Bikes added that its bikes are equipped with batteries that it says \"meet or exceed rigorous international safety standards.\"",
      "Rad said it tested its batteries at independent third-party labs, which confirmed that the batteries met the industry's highest standards.",
      "\"Our understanding is that the CPSC does not dispute the conclusions of these tests,\" a Rad spokesperson added in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Rad also pointed out that all lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are improperly charged or mishandled, and that Rad advises against misusing them in its customer safety guides.",
      "Rad added that it had hoped to work with the CPSC to help its customers upgrade to the company's \"Safe Shield\" batteries, which incorporate new technology, at a discounted rate. Rad said the commission's request that Rad either offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers would put it out of business.",
      "The batteries cost $550 alone, or between $1,500 and $2,000 when sold with e-bikes.",
      "Rad did not indicate how many products are affected by the CPSC's notice when asked by CBS News.",

      "Stocks have been swinging sharply, not just day to day but also hour to hour, in recent weeks as worries weigh about what the Fed will do with interest rates and whether too much money is pouring into AI and creating a bubble.

    "story": [
      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Aside from underlying health care inflation, Medicare's costs are also increasing because of increased demand for medical services, CMS said this month.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Workers with employee-sponsored coverage are also likely to see their costs climb\u00a0next year, with most expected to pay 6% to 7% more for their 2026 plans, according to an analysis from consultant Mercer.",

      "Kohl's on Monday said it has tapped its fourth CEO in as many years, attempting to staunch an extended sales slide and to move beyond a leadership scandal that led to the departure of its previous chief executive.",
      "The company named Michael Bender as its permanent CEO nearly seven months after he took over on an interim basis.",
      "Bender replaced Ashley Buchanan who was fired in May after an internal investigation found that he had directed the company to do business with a vendor founded by someone with whom he had a personal relationship.",
      "At the same time, Kohl's is struggling to reverse a long-term sales slump amid a challenging economic environment for many shoppers, who are grappling with an affordability crisis. Retailers are also navigating tariffs rolled out this year by the Trump administration, adding to their challenges.",
      "\"The appointment of Michael Bender as permanent CEO of Kohl's brings some much-needed stability to the beleaguered chain,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with GlobalData, in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"Unfortunately. Kohl's has been one of the worst performers in retail \u2013 with sales and market share plummeting since 2019. This chronic underperformance is directly linked to operational sloppiness and the absence of a clear strategy.\"",
      "The board conducted a comprehensive search using an external firm before picking Bender as its next CEO, Chairman John Schlifske said in the statement.",
      "Bender is a retail veteran with 30 years of experience at retailers from Walmart to PepsiCo.",
      "Buchanan, who was Kohl's CEO for less than four months, had replaced CEO Tom Kingsbury, who had served as the company's leader from 2023 until early 2025. Prior to Kingsbury, Michelle Gass was Kohl's CEO until she departed in late 2022 to become the president of Levi Strauss.",

    "summary": "Those prioritizing economy say Trump is not spending enough time on it, as ratings of economy, his handling of inflation slip.",
    "story": [
      "The situation around Venezuela has Americans asking to know more.",
      "Across party lines, big majorities say the administration needs to explain what the U.S. intends regarding any action, and that it has not done so clearly yet.",
      "Meanwhile, what Americans hear from the White House about inflation is, they say, not what they're actually feeling at home: rising prices and worsening economic views.",
      "In the meantime, Americans do not think of Venezuela as a major threat to the US. Instead, more see a minor one, and they are largely opposed to potential military action.",
      "So, the idea of potential U.S. military action in Venezuela meets with widespread disapproval. It doesn't get overwhelming backing from Republicans either.",
      "Three in four Americans also say Trump would need congressional approval before taking military action in Venezuela, including just over half of Republicans.",
      "Just one in five Americans have heard a lot about the U.S. military buildup in the first place. That may be another expression of that sense of limited information about the purpose.",
      "The current military attacks on boats suspected of bringing drugs find division \u2014 just over half approve, driven by nearly universal support among Republicans \u2014 though Americans overall overwhelmingly say they should see the evidence that there are drugs.",
      "However, most Americans don't think U.S. military action in Venezuela would change the amount of drugs coming into the U.S.",
      "Looking more closely within the president's GOP base: MAGA Republicans are actually more supportive of potential military action than non-MAGA ones.",
      "For context, that is similar to what we've seen over time on many issues, including foreign policy, in which that part of the base is largely deferential to the president. (As one example, MAGA was also supportive of the bombing in Iran months ago.) Most of them say the president has explained things, and in turn, are more apt to see any action in Venezuela as decreasing the amount of drugs entering the U.S.",
      "But many who are opposed to military action, including those within the GOP ranks, may also be seeing this in terms of issue priorities. They're a little more likely to judge the administration on what it does about the economy than those in favor. And most who judge him on the economy think he isn't spending enough time on it.",
      "Here's what Americans say about the economy",
      "There's a disconnect between how Americans hear the White House describing the economy, and what they're feeling themselves.",
      "Most Americans say Trump describes things with prices and inflation as better than they really are.",
      "(This includes four in 10 Republicans who say this about Trump. They are also among those more likely to say prices are going up.)",
      "This comes as ratings for the overall economy continue to be low \u2014 as they've been for years \u2014 ticking down this week to their lowest mark in 2025.",
      "Prices, more generally, are still seen by most as going up.",
      "As we head into the holiday season, that economic dissatisfaction includes the majority of Americans who feel President Trump's policies are making the cost of food and groceries, specifically, go up.",
      "So, that disconnect appears to continue to weigh on the president's ratings.",
      "There are many ways Americans judge a president. For those who say they judge Mr. Trump most on what he does about the economy and inflation, they overwhelmingly say he isn't spending enough time on that.",
      "That, in turn, has continued to push his approval on handling the economy and inflation down over the course of several months. That trend continues this week, with assessments of the overall economy, and his ratings for handling the economy and inflation, hitting lows for the year.",
      "More than two-thirds disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "He does especially poorly on handling the economy among people who mainly judge him on that.",
      "Among independents, his ratings for handling the economy, and his ratings overall, have also hit lows for the year. That has continued to push his approval rating overall lower over time too, now down to their low point for his second term after a steady decline over recent months.",
      "The president does a little better on his handling of immigration, backed by continued large support from the GOP base, as has been the case for months.",
      "The decline in the president's overall approval ratings connects to people's economic priorities in this way: even among those who voted for him in 2024, disapproval today is more likely to come when people are judging him mostly on the economy.",
      "Deportation",
      "The administration's deportation program continues to split the country, but support is underpinned by strong approval from Republicans.",
      "Most \u2014 particularly those outside the GOP base \u2014 continue to feel that ICE is detaining more people than necessary.",
      "But the deportation program is seen by many as more undermining than strengthening the economy.",
      "One possible reason: a third of the country (who tend to live in cities and suburbs) say it is impacting their community for the worse, and they feel people in their area are staying home more as a result of the program.",
      "Epstein files",
      "Americans across party lines think it is important to see the Epstein files released.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly believe they will contain damaging information about powerful people. Most say it's too soon to know if what's in them is true. On balance, though, more think that information will be true rather than false.",
      "Republicans are more satisfied with how the Trump administration is handling the Epstein case than they were in the summer. (The survey was conducted just after Trump said Congress should vote to release the files, which they did shortly thereafter.) Today, most others are not satisfied.",
      "However, the president's Republican base says issues surrounding the files are not important to how they judge him. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say this doesn't affect how they evaluate Trump overall. (Independents and Democrats, though, give it comparably more importance in this regard.)",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between November 19-21, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Those sinful-looking blueberry pancakes, and that nice, noisy foamy latte \u2013 would you believe they are rescuing journalism, in and around Camden, Maine, at least?",
      "Here in lobster country, at the Villager Cafe, customers can have their breakfast or lunch with a side of news, a weekly newspaper called the Midcoast Villager. \"I was just reading about the SNAP benefits and different food pantries in the area,\" said one cafe customer.",
      "The cafe subsidizes the paper; the newsroom is one floor up. Throw in the rent from all the other tenants in the building, along with revenue from the Inn at Camden Place next door (same ownership), and it all helps.",
      "\"From the business standpoint, it achieves a sustainability,\" said Reade Brower. At one time, Brower owned almost all of Maine's newspapers, before selling most of them off. In September 2024, he merged four weeklies into the Midcoast Villager. The cafe opened this past April, but not just to make money.",
      "\"The accountability issues and local sports and all that stuff is important to a lot of people,\" he said. \"I don't think that's enough to sell and keep newspapers alive right now. I think it has to revolve around community. And what better way to serve community than to invite people here for food and to mix all this stuff together?\"",
      "How often do you see the owner of a newspaper, and members of his staff, hanging out with readers over breakfast?",
      "Kathleen Capetta helps Brower run what they both see as an experiment in rebuilding trust in news. \"We're present, we're visible, we're real,\" she said. \"We're not behind a screen.\"",
      "And would that experiment work if the food weren't good? \"Absolutely not, no!\" Capetta laughed.",
      "\"It's good, classic diner food, but a little bit elevated, which is I think kind of like our paper,\" said deputy editor Alex Seitz-Wald. He is the face of the newspaper when he parks himself in the cafe on Friday mornings, to hear complaints, story tips, whatever. \"Having a place where people can vent, or can say something, and have it be heard, I think is really valuable,\" he said.",
      "Seitz-Wald was an NBC politics reporter in Washington, D.C., for a decade before taking a chance \u2013 and a pay cut \u2013 to work for the Midcoast Villager, a start-up in a field where two newspapers die every week.",
      "How's the Villager doing? Circulation revenue, we're told, is 40% above what all four papers it replaced took in \u2013 so, promising.",
      "\"I'm quite glad that I still have a newspaper to work for,\" said Glenn Billington. A local news lifer, he's the optimistic ad salesman and columnist for the Midcoast Villager, just as he was for one of its now-defunct predecessors.",
      "The mascot on the paper's masthead is Vern, who is the epitome of Midcoast Maine. \"He sure is,\" said Billington. \"Look at his sou'wester. He's got the hat that you wear when the wind blows from the southwest and it brings rain. And he's got the telescope. Vern's looking at the future of newspapers.\"",
      "What one sees at the Villager Cafe is old-fashioned \u2013 people sitting down at tables, eating and talking and looking at each other eye-to-eye. Or as Brower put it, \"You're picking up what we're putting down.\"",

      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin has erased all of its 2025 gains and is on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022. Here's what experts say about the decline.",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",
      "\"When tech sneezes, it's natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold,\" noted Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, in an email.",
      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",

      "Amazon is issuing settlement refunds to eligible Prime Members, starting with automatic payments issued between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24 (see below for more details on how payments are being made).",
      "\"Our settlement required Amazon to pay those people who clearly qualify without them having to do anything,\" Christopher Bissex, deputy director of public affairs at the FTC, told CBS News. \"So those people are getting the automatic payments.\"",

      "How do I know if I qualify?",
      "Only customers who signed up for Amazon Prime between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, are eligible to receive a refund.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

      "They go by names like @TRUMP_ARMY\u2014 or @MAGANationX, and their verified accounts proudly display portraits of President Donald Trump, voter rallies and American flags. And they're constantly posting about U.S. politics to their followers, sounding like diehard fans of the president.",
      "But after a weekend update to the social media platform X, it's now clear that the owners of these accounts, and many others, are located in regions such as South Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.",
      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2013 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",

      "Several sources told CBS News that the classified draft memo, which was on ODNI letterhead, was written by Paul McNamara, who is in charge of Gabbard's Director's Initiatives Group, which is tasked with providing \"transparency and accountability\" and executing President Trump's intelligence-related executive orders. McNamara could not be reached for comment.",
      "A spokesperson, Olivia Coleman, said, \"ODNI followed its obligation to report information received concerning the alleged activities of a member of the Intelligence Community to that person's employing agency.\"",
      "\"After a whistleblower came forward with an allegation, ODNI documented the accusation and lawfully reported it, fulfilling our legal duty to alert appropriate agencies when alleged/potential security concerns are brought to our attention,\" Coleman said. \"There were no predetermined conclusions or assessments made, and every action taken was done so in consultation with legal counsel.\"",
      "The Blaze report became the subject of extensive media coverage and discussion on social media, especially among supporters of Mr. Trump.",
      "Word of this supposed break in the case reached Mr. Trump, two of the sources said, although it's unclear how he learned of it.",
      "The bomb-planting incident is one of the lingering mysteries surrounding the events around the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, on the eve of the Jan. 6 riot. Nearly five years since the pipe bombs were placed, no suspect has been arrested or identified. The FBI said the bombs were viable, but they did not detonate.",
      "CBS News was not shown the memo, but sources said McNamara had accessed confidential files to obtain details about the woman for the draft memo, including her place of work and Social Security number.",
      "Gabbard, the top ODNI official, has since distanced herself from the memo, telling senior officials that the information about the woman spread without her knowledge while Gabbard was traveling abroad, several sources said.",
      "An ODNI official also said the draft memo hadn't been reviewed or approved by agency leadership.",
      "Sources said this situation, and others, were viewed internally by some senior administration officials as interfering in areas that were beyond the purview of the national intelligence director's office. Axios reported in September that Justice Department officials believed ODNI had hindered their case against former CIA Director John Brennan. The New York Times in October reported that ODNI had accessed FBI investigative files related to Charlie Kirk's assassination, searched for evidence of conspiracies and potentially undermined the government's case against the alleged assassin.",
      "The federal security officer cooperated with the FBI, sources close to the matter said. Her lawyer said publicly she had done nothing wrong. Both the woman and her lawyer declined to comment.",
      "She returned to work after being placed on a brief leave, one of the sources said.",
      "An FBI spokesperson and representatives for Blaze News didn't respond to requests for comment. Blaze News updated its story with one correction and further information, but it remains online.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Trump housing official Bill Pulte, who referred him to the Justice Department earlier this month for an investigation of mortgage and tax fraud allegations.",
      "Swalwell, who entered the California governor's race last week, filed the 19-page federal civil lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia accusing Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, of violations of privacy in obtaining Swalwell's mortgage records. The lawsuit also accuses the Trump administration of engaging in a pattern of political retribution through the courts.",
      "\"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "Pulte has also submitted criminal referrals to the Justice Department for investigations of Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The allegations against Swalwell are related to the mortgage on his property in Washington, D.C., CBS News previously reported.",
      "Swalwell's lawsuit says that the disclosure of his mortgage records harmed his reputation \"at a critical juncture in his career: the very moment when he had planned to announce his campaign for Governor of California.\"",
      "The civil complaint said that \"before President Trump reassumed office in January 2025, he routinely threatened to use his power to punish his political opponents,\" and then continued that \"after taking office, he wasted little time in following through on those threats.\"",
      "James' criminal case was dismissed Monday after a judge found that the interim U.S. attorney who secured her indictment was improperly appointed. James has also sought to have her case tossed out on other grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August after Pulte accused her of making misrepresentations on mortgage documents. But Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her removal was unlawful, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in January on whether Mr. Trump can fire her from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "Pulte referred Schiff to the Justice Department in May for investigation over alleged mortgage fraud. Sources told CBS News last week that the Justice Department is investigating the probe into Schiff, who has denied any wrongdoing.",

    "story": [
      "A group of civil rights organizations is seeking an order to prevent the closure of a Justice Department office dedicated to preventing unrest and violence in U.S. cities.",
      "The groups are suing for a preliminary injunction to avert the closure of the Community Relations Service, which was launched in 1964 to avert rioting and racial strife in American communities.",
      "The office has been known informally as \"America's Peacemaker.\"",
      "As CBS News reported in April, the Trump administration was planning to shutter the Community Relations Service.",
      "In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, several organizations, including multiple NAACP branches and the Missionary Baptist Convention of Missouri, argue that the Justice Department is violating the law in closing the office.",
      "\"Rather than pursue legislation to eliminate the agency, however, (the Justice Department) set out to destroy the Community Relations Service unilaterally,\" the lawsuit said. \"Defendants did so behind closed doors, without notice or public input, and without consulting the communities that depend on the Community Relations Service.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice refuses to follow the law \u2014 and it cannot offer any coherent explanation for its actions,\" the lawsuit also said. \"Instead, the Executive Branch is brazenly defying Congress.\"",
      "President John F. Kennedy conceived of the office in the early 1960s, saying the federal government should have experts who can \"identify tensions before they reach the crisis stage\" and \"work quietly to ease tensions and improve relations in any community threatened or torn with strife.\"",
      "The office has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest. It was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged after the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also worked to ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, in Akron, Ohio, in 2022, after the shooting of a Black man by police and deploying twice to Minneapolis during the trial of Derek Chauvin after the killing of George Floyd in 2020 in Minnesota.",
      "The newly filed lawsuit also includes details of the office's history, pointing out that in the 1970s, CRS had been \"involved in mediating school desegregation conflicts\" and played a major role in helping Boston address the busing crisis that arose during desegregation.",
      "Kyle Freeny, a senior attorney with the Washington Litigation Group, is representing the civil rights groups in their lawsuit.",
      "\"The Community Relations Service was not an abstract government agency to these plaintiffs,\" Freeny told CBS News. \"It was an active partner helping them mediate racial tensions, support faith communities, protect vulnerable students and address discrimination in real time. By dismantling CRS, the government cut off proven, irreplaceable support that these organizations depended on to carry out their missions.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.",
      "In a speech in July 2024, Justin Lock, a former director of the Community Relations Service, lauded the office's accomplishments, saying it had been \"at the intersection of some of the most critical moments in our nation's journey toward justice.\"",
      "\"In 2020, when Americans marched in solidarity with the people of Brunswick, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, CRS engaged with communities as an impartial, confidential facilitator, helping stakeholders identify and implement solutions that help communities to heal and move forward,\" Locke said.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's nearly four-year assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to the U.S. before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Taking to Truth Social\u00a0on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",
      "The president said he directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and that Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainians.",
      "\"I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0wrote on X, \"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table. There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Lavrov stressed that, while Russia was still waiting to receive \"from our American colleagues\" an updated version of the peace proposal, Moscow expected it to include basic tenets agreed between Presidents Trump and Putin during their August meeting in Alaska.",
      "\"Key proposals of Trump's plan are based on understandings reached in Anchorage,\" Lavrov said. He said those principles were \"reflected in the plan\" proposed last week by the White House, \"which we welcomed - President Putin said that.\"",
      "\"We are ready to discuss concrete formulations because there are a whole row of questions that need to be clarified,\" Lavrov said, adding: \"If there will be no spirit and letter of Anchorage on the key understandings that we have fixated, then it will be a different situation in principle.\"",
      "Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which involve U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all meeting together at the same time.",
      "Umerov also\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A Trump administration official said there was no agreement for Zelenskyy to come to the U.S. as of late Tuesday morning, but that if a meeting does happen in the coming days, it could take place at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Rubio, Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday the document specifies that the U.S. intends to offer \"security assurances\" that she said are along the lines of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which\u00a0commits members to come to the defense of a NATO state that is attacked.",
      "On Saturday, a group of NATO members and other U.S. allies released a joint statement calling the proposed peace plan \"a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following the discussions in Geneva. Rubio described one session in Geneva as \"very meaningful\" but added that \"there's still some work left to do, and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Zelenskyy to reach a deal by Thanksgiving, though Rubio described that deadline as flexible on Sunday.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2014 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct.",
      "While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",

The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump pardoned Gobble and Waddle, with Waddle ready to stand in if Gobble cannot perform his duties. Mr. Trump issued Gobble a \"complete and unconditional pardon, telling the turkey \"God bless you.\"",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "Mr. Trump will be traveling to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, as he did nearly every Thanksgiving in his first term. Former President Joe Biden, meanwhile, traveled to Nantucket over the weekend, per his daughter's Instagram, a Biden family tradition for\u00a0over 40 years.",

    "summary": "The rulings\u200b from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",
      "The rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for Comey and James, who both argued their prosecutions are retaliatory and motivated by President Trump's efforts to punish his political foes.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her ruling in the James case.",
      "Currie ordered the indictments to be dismissed without prejudice, which would allow prosecutors to seek charges again. She suggested that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in Comey's case since the statute of limitations for the offenses expired at the end of September.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking at an unrelated news conference in Memphis on Monday, told reporters the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "Lawyers for both Comey and James are also seeking to have their indictments tossed out on numerous other legal grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective. The judge overseeing Comey's case heard arguments on his motion last week but has yet to rule.",
      "\"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" James said in a statement in response to the ruling. \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"",
      "In a video statement, Comey said \"the message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence, and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News, \"We believe the attorney in this case, Lindsey Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position, but she was in fact legally appointed.\"",
      "The judge's rulings",
      "In her decisions, the judge found that Halligan's appointment violated both a federal law known as Section 546, which governs U.S. attorney vacancies, and the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
      "In evaluating the text of Section 546, Currie found that the power to name an interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia for 120 days to fill the current vacancy rested not with the attorney general, but with district court for the region. She wrote that if the government's interpretation of the law were correct, then the president could evade the Senate confirmation process \"indefinitely\" by \"stacking\" consecutive 120-day appointments.",
      "\"In sum, the text, structure, and history of section 546 point to one conclusion: the Attorney General's authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney lasts for a total of 120 days from the date she first invokes section 546 after the departure of a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney,\" Currie wrote. \"If the position remains vacant at the end of the 120-day period, the exclusive authority to make further interim appointments under the statute shifts to the district court, where it remains until the President's nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Halligan was not appointed in a manner consistent with this framework.\"",
      "She concluded that Halligan has been unlawfully serving as interim U.S. attorney since Sept. 22. Comey was indicted Sept. 25, and James was charged Oct. 9.",
      "Halligan's appointment",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in one of the criminal cases brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith. She took over as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia in a temporary capacity in late September and sought the indictments against Comey and James soon after.",
      "Bondi tapped Halligan as interim U.S. attorney shortly after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Bondi appointed Halligan under Section 546, the federal law that governs U.S. attorney vacancies and allows the attorney general to select an interim U.S. attorney, who can then serve for 120 days. The Trump administration has invoked that law and another measure to install temporary prosecutors in New Jersey, Nevada and Los Angeles, though three different federal judges have all found they were serving unlawfully.",
      "In the U.S. Attorney's Office in eastern Virginia, Siebert had first been tapped to lead the office in January to serve for 120 days. Ahead of the expiration of his term, the federal court for the region voted to keep him in the role, exercising authority granted to it under federal law.",
      "After Siebert departed, though, Mr. Trump urged Bondi to install Halligan in the post. Bondi issued a September order purporting to name Halligan as the interim U.S. attorney, to serve for 120 days. Days after she took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Halligan secured the two-count indictment against Comey, which accuses him of lying to Congress during testimony in September 2020 and obstructing a congressional proceeding. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted in early October on charges of bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty to their respective charges.",
      "Comey's attorneys argued that his indictment was \"fatally flawed\" because Halligan, who alone presented the case to the grand jury and signed the indictment, was invalidly appointed to her position.",
      "They argued that under the framework for a temporary U.S. attorney appointment, the 120-day clock starts from the time of the attorney general's initial appointment of Siebert and limits the total tenure of interim appointments to 120 days. Because Siebert had already served the 120 days, only the district court had authority to appoint a successor, defense lawyers said.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers defended the validity of Halligan's selection and argued the 120-day limit applies on a \"per-appointment basis.\" Each appointment, they said, triggers its own clock and requires the attorney general to revisit her interim selections every 120 days.",
      "To shore up Halligan's work in Comey and James' cases, the Justice Department submitted to the court an October order from Bondi that also purported to name her special attorney, applied retroactively, and ratified her actions before the grand juries and signature on the indictments.",
      "Justice Department lawyers argued that even if Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid, any government lawyer can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment, and Bondi has the authority to make her a government attorney.",
      "But Currie rejected Bondi's attempt to retroactively name Halligan as a special attorney and wrote that the Justice Department has not pointed to any authority that allows the attorney general to \"reach back in time and rewrite the terms of a past appointment.\" She also said the attorney general's attempt to ratify Halligan's actions falls short.",
      "\"The implications of a contrary conclusion are extraordinary,\" Currie wrote. \"It would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street \u2014 attorney or not \u2014 into the grand jury room to secure an indictment so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.\"",
      "Currie heard arguments on Comey's bid to dismiss the case on the appointment grounds earlier this month alongside the similar effort by James. Like in Comey's case, only Halligan presented the case against James to the grand jury and signed the indictment.",
      "Asked on Monday if the ruling would have any impact on Halligan's role, Bondi told reporters, \"it does not.\"",
      "\"We have made Lindsay Halligan a special U.S. attorney so she is in court,\" Bondi said. \"She can fight in court just like she was, and we believe we will be successful on appeal.\"",

      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",

It's an AI initiative the White House hopes will result in quicker breakthroughs in areas of research including disease therapies.",
      "Michael Krastios, science adviser to the president, told reporters on a conference call the Genesis mission is \"the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo program.\"",
      "\"By fusing massive federal data sets, advanced supercomputing capabilities, and world-leading scientific facilities, the Genesis mission will use AI to automate experiment design, accelerate simulation and generate protective models for everything from protein folding to fusion plasma dynamics,\" Krastios said. \"This will shorten discovery timelines from years to days or even hours, empowering scientists to test bolder hypotheses and discover breakthroughs currently unreachable.\"",
      "White House officials told reporters on the conference call that they want to bring in AI supercomputing capacity that the private sector is building. The White House said there's been significant interest from the private sector from companies that include Nvidia and Dell.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:21:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization, but some say the Venezuelan entity is \"not a group\" at all.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government's designation of the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization officially took effect Monday as part of President Trump's aggressive campaign to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The U.S. identifies Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the group's leader \u2014 and he says the claims of narcoterrorism are actually part of a bid by Mr. Trump to force him from power.",
      "The terrorist designation, which was announced last week, is designed to put more pressure on Maduro, even as U.S. warships and more than 10,000 American troops step up training exercises in the region. The U.S. military has also launched deadly strikes on boats it alleges were carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast \u2014 many of them allegedly run by the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. accuses of ties to the Maduro regime.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, Maduro's government said it \"absolutely rejects the new and ridiculous fabrication\" designating \"the nonexistent Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization, thus repeating an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela, under the classic U.S. format of regime change.\"",
      "Ahead of the designation announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed the group was \"responsible for terrorist violence \u2026 as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "The Cartel de los Soles was also hit in July with U.S. economic sanctions, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said highlighted \"the illegitimate Maduro regime's facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles.\"",
      "What is \u2014 and what isn't \u2014 the Cartel de los Soles?",
      "But what is the so-called Cartel of the Suns? It is not, in the traditional sense, a Latin American drug cartel along the lines of the family-run Sinaloa or the Jalisco New Generation.",
      "The \"suns\" in the name refers to the insignia used for decades to adorn the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.",
      "Venezuelans, including prosecutors and other officials, started using the term colloquially in the 1990s to refer to the cadre of high-ranking military officers who'd grown rich from facilitating drug-running. As corruption expanded across the country, first under the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro as his successor, analysts say the term came to encompass the loosely defined network of police and government officials that facilitated and profited off of activities ranging from illegal mining to fuel and drug trafficking.",
      "The term was first elevated to define an alleged Maduro-led drug trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department, during President Trump's first administration, announced indictments of Venezuela's leader and members of his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges. The Justice Department accused Maduro, through the Cartel de los Soles, of working directly with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine through Venezuela to the U.S.",
      "The designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization has generally been reserved for groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the Trump administration has expanded its use to designate eight Latin American organizations accused of drug trafficking and people smuggling, calling it an effort to counter narcoterrorism.",
      "Some analysts say it's a stretch to even define the Cartel de los Soles as a single unified organization.",
      "\"It is not a group,\" Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank told The Associated Press. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"",
      "\"It is not a hierarchical or ideological group,\" agrees the InSight Crime outlet, which is run by two former journalists who covered Latin America extensively for decades. \"Its structure consists of a diffuse network of cells embedded within Venezuela's main military branches: the army, the navy, the air force, and the national guard, from the lowest to the highest ranks.\"",
      "\"Although the concept is primarily associated with the military sector, other branches of the [Venezuelan] State embedded within the criminal ecosystem have also been identified, including police forces, the executive branch, and various public officials,\" InSight Crime said in an analysis of the purported cartel published in September.",
      "Terrorist designation comes amid U.S. military strikes and build-up",
      "In recent weeks, the U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing dozens of people and sparking a debate in Washington about the legality of the extrajudicial attacks.",
      "The Trump administration has carried out the strikes without providing evidence to support its assertions that the boats are carrying drugs and operated by criminal organizations. It says the attacks, which began in late September off the coast of Venezuela and expanded to the eastern Pacific, are meant to stop narcotics reaching American soil.",
      "But Maduro, and some others, see the U.S. military operations and massive buildup of hardware in the region as an effort to precipitate his ouster \u2014   if not the prelude to an overt operation to topple his government.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said the formal designation of the Cartel de los Soles will give a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" to address Maduro's alleged crimes.",
      "But speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, he declined to give details on what those options included, or to say whether the U.S. military was planning to carry out strikes on targets inside Venezuela.",
      "\"Nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.",
      "Since American troops and hardware \u2014   including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's most advanced aircraft carrier \u2014   started pouring into the Caribbean earlier this year, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition has been more confidently voicing its perennial promise to see Maduro forced from office, fueling speculation over the real endgame of what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation.",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell during an extensive interview for 60 Minutes just weeks ago whether the U.S. operations around Venezuela were about \"getting rid of Maduro,\" President Trump said they were \"about many things,\" but he said the Venezuelan leader's days in office were likely numbered.",

    "summary": "Fewer than one-third of those arrested by Border Patrol during the recent immigration crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, a government document says.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News.",
      "The government document undermines claims by Trump administration officials who said the crackdown, dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web, was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "Roughly 200 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents recorded more than 270 immigration arrests during the Charlotte campaign, which began on the weekend of Nov. 15, the document shows. Fewer than 90 of those arrested by Border Patrol were categorized as \"criminal aliens\" in the document.",
      "Those statistics do not include arrests made by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though Border Patrol played the principal role in Operation Charlotte's Web. The document also does not specify the severity of the crimes of the detainees listed as criminals, nor whether their records included convictions or solely criminal charges.",
      "While DHS has publicly maintained that the crackdown in Charlotte is ongoing, separate internal documents say Border Patrol's operation there concluded, with agents demobilizing from the area last week. ICE has a permanent presence in North Carolina, and is expected to continue operations there.",
      "CBS News has reported, citing U.S. officials and internal DHS documents, that Border Patrol is preparing to launch a new operation in New Orleans as soon as the first week of December.",
      "A spokesperson for DHS said the information reported by CBS News is \"likely inaccurate,\" but did not offer a breakdown of criminality that was different to the numbers contained in the document.",
      "The spokesperson cited a press release that announced over 130 immigration arrests in the Charlotte area during the first two days of the operation, including 44 individuals who DHS said had criminal charges or convictions for aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on a police officer, battery, driving under the influence and other crimes. Two of the detainees were identified as gang members in the release.",
      "The DHS document obtained by CBS News offers a window into the most recent operation led by outspoken and controversial Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the de facto on-the-ground enforcer of President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has tasked Bovino and teams of Border Patrol agents with bringing its mass deportation campaign to several cities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago and, most recently, Charlotte. The deployment has been unprecedented in nature and scope. Border Patrol's work has been historically limited to stopping the illegal movement of people and drugs along the borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as some coastal regions.",
      "In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents \u2014 in some cases accompanied by Bovino \u2014 have carried out arrests, often captured on social media videos, at Home Depot parking lots and other public areas, rounding up day laborers, landscapers and other immigrants they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The aggressive operations have fueled strong criticism from local elected officials, who have denounced Border Patrol's actions as harsh and indiscriminate, and accused agents of engaging in racial profiling, including against Hispanic U.S. citizens. Trump administration officials have rejected those accusations, saying use of force has been employed to protect agents and that arrests have been based on someone's illegal presence in the U.S., not their race.",
      "In the Charlotte area, Border Patrol agents were captured on video smashing the car window of a U.S. citizen, carrying out arrests outside of businesses and approaching men decorating a Christmas tree.",
      "Like in Chicago and Los Angeles, the operation in Charlotte triggered significant community backlash and concerns. Some businesses closed their doors temporarily. Local high school students staged walk-outs to protest the arrests. And school officials in the region reported tens of thousands of student absences.",
      "A CBS News poll released this past weekend found that 58% of Americans believed federal immigration agents were stopping and detaining \"more people than necessary.\"",

      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims that the aluminum ingredients in vaccines cause a variety of harmful reactions, from allergies to autism. Scientists say that's wrong and warn of risks if they're removed.",
    "story": [
      "As the federal government prepares for the next meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has intensified his attacks on aluminum vaccine components used in many shots to boost the body's immune response.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before seeking public office, claims that aluminum adjuvants are neurotoxic and tied to autism, asthma, autoimmune disease, and food allergies.",
      "But science and medicine advances a different view. Strong recommendations that parents introduce peanut-containing foods to infants early, for instance, have led to a drop in the incidence rate of peanut allergies.",
      "Since taking office, Kennedy has ordered reviews of vaccine ingredients, citing aluminum as a top concern. A discussion of \"adjuvants and contaminants\" is on the vaccine advisory panel's draft agenda.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0webpage that for years has assured the public vaccines do not cause autism was updated Nov. 19 with new language stating that studies have not definitively ruled out a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "He has also targeted scientists who have published studies showing aluminum adjuvants are safe. In August, Kennedy denounced a large Danish study finding no link between aluminum in vaccines and childhood disease, calling it a \"deceitful propaganda stunt\" and demanding its retraction. The Annals of Internal Medicine rejected the claim and refused to retract the study.",
      "And, regarding the upcoming advisory panel meeting, HHS spokesperson Emily HIlliard said ACIP \"is independently reviewing the full body of evidence on adjuvants and other vaccine components to ensure the highest safety standards.\"",
      "The stakes are high because Kennedy's push to cast doubt on aluminum isn't just about the ingredient itself. It's part of a broader strategy to foster uncertainty about vaccine safety and lay the groundwork to challenge the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which drug manufacturers say is essential to ensure a stable market for shots.",
      "But researchers across infectious diseases, immunology, pediatrics, and epidemiology say the data is clear: Aluminum adjuvants are safe.",
      "\"Aluminum is the third most common element on the Earth's surface,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"So we're all exposed to aluminum all the time. The water that we drink has aluminum in it. The food that we eat has aluminum in it.\"",
      "Vaccines add only a tiny amount of aluminum to the body \u2014 a combined total of about 8 milligrams \u2014 after the schedule of childhood vaccines is complete. Offit said that over the first 18 years of life, people naturally take in about 400 milligrams of aluminum from everyday sources.",
      "\"I don't know why there is so much concern,\" said Dr. Rajesh Gupta, a former FDA vaccine scientist. \"Aluminum gets distributed in the body everywhere. It is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in the urine. So, it is not that aluminum stays in the body.\"",
      "How they work",
      "The aluminum in vaccines isn't foil or metal. It's a compound of aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, that help the vaccine work better.",
      "It's a bit like zinc in cold tablets: Patients don't swallow chunks of metal, instead ingesting a zinc salt that dissolves safely in the body.",
      "In vaccines, these aluminum salts give the immune system an extra nudge so it learns to recognize the target germ more effectively.",
      "When injected, the vaccine stays near the injection site and causes mild, short-lived inflammation that summons immune cells. Those cells pick up the vaccine antigen, a harmless piece of a virus or bacterium, and carry it to nearby lymph nodes. There, the adjuvants show it around like a wanted poster so the body can identify and destroy the germ quickly.",
      "Dr. Harm HogenEsch, a professor of immunopathology at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, said that aluminum adjuvants work only when they're injected in the same spot as the vaccine ingredient they're meant to boost, to help nearby immune cells learn to recognize the germ. If the two shots are given in different places, he said, \"you don't see that effect.\"",
      "In response to Kennedy's claims, scientists say that anything that acts as an adjuvant can, in principle, also boost an allergic response. But that doesn't mean aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are turning children into food-allergic time bombs. Antigens in vaccines such as the hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV proteins are not allergens, and no food proteins are put into vaccines.",
      "Animal experiments",
      "Animal studies form the basis of Kennedy's claim that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can create allergies. In these experiments, scientists deliberately sensitize rats or mice by injecting them with a food protein mixed with aluminum. The aluminum strengthens the immune response, but it does not cause an allergy by itself.",
      "\"That's the basis for a lot of the experimental mouse models, where you inject a food allergen with an aluminum adjuvant to sensitize the mice,\" HogenEsch said. \"I'm not aware of any food antigen being included in vaccines, and so I don't really see a way by which this could happen.\"",
      "Dr. Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, went further, noting that there is no plausible route for vaccines to create a peanut allergy out of thin air. \"Someone would have had to mix peanut proteins in with the actual vaccine prior to injection.\"",
      "Dr. Stefan H. E. Kaufmann, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, said results from mice often don't match what happens in people, because \"mice are much easier to push into allergic reactions than humans.\" In other words, what looks dramatic in a rodent study doesn't automatically apply to human immune systems.",
      "And in this case, it's \"important to distinguish between how aluminum behaves in lab animals versus people,\" Kaufmann said.",
      "Human studies",
      "Beyond animal models and theoretical scenarios, scientists have looked hard for signals of harm in large human datasets.",
      "In 2023, a study by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration coordinated by the CDC, reported a slight increase in asthma among children with higher aluminum exposure before age 2, but the association disappeared in further analyses.",
      "\"That paper was roundly criticized,\" Offit said. \"When they controlled for breastfeeding, the association between asthma and receipt of aluminum-adjuvant-containing vaccines disappeared.\"",
      "\"It should have never been published,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Kathy Edwards, professor emerita of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that false signals are common when large databases are mined for dozens of outcomes.",
      "\"When you look at a hundred different things, just by the law of percentages, some of those may look like there is a signal,\" she said. \"The whole RFK Jr. assessment is really prone to cherry-picking,\" she said, adding that \"there does need to be some kind of basic understanding of statistics for people to interpret this.\"",
      "Soon after the 2023 U.S. findings drew attention, scientists at the CDC contacted Dr. Anders Hviid, head of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, to see whether his team could replicate the work.",
      "\"It makes perfect sense to try to replicate findings of any kind in different data sources,\" Hviid said.",
      "Hviid's nationwide Danish study followed 1.2 million children over two decades, using linked national health registries that record every vaccination and diagnosis.",
      "\"Our health care system is quite egalitarian. It's free, and there's universal access. And everyone is in these nationwide registers,\" he said. Their findings: no increased risk of these conditions associated with increasing amounts of aluminum received through the vaccines.",
      "Rare bumps",
      "Doctors have documented one genuine reaction to aluminum adjuvants: itchy nodules at the injection site, called \"pruritic granulomas.\" These small bumps are so rare that most allergists and pediatricians will never see a single case.",
      "This reaction \"doesn't lead to something bad, and it really isn't associated with anything other than that local irritation,\" Edwards said.",
      "Researchers believe these bumps represent a localized immune response \u2014 meaning only in the area of the injection, not a body-wide allergy \u2014 that is very different from the kind of immediate allergic reaction people treat with antihistamines. These include the reactions driven by food or beestings, when histamine, the body's own alarm signal, floods the system within minutes and causes hives, swelling, or breathing trouble. Kedl said that distinction often gets lost in public debate.",
      "Eliminating aluminum adjuvants",
      "For many experts, the real issue is not just whether aluminum is safe but what happens to the entire vaccine program if aluminum adjuvants are stripped out. For many modern vaccines that rely on a single purified protein \u2014 such as those for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, hepatitis B, and HPV \u2014 adjuvants are crucial.",
      "Edwards said that simply swapping in a different adjuvant isn't realistic.",
      "\"They're kind of all built on one another,\" she said. Once a vaccine has been proved to work and become the standard of care, new or updated versions are generally no longer tested against a placebo in people who should be getting that vaccine. Instead, they're tested against the existing product, which means each approval rests on the one before it.",
      "Core childhood vaccines would probably have to be reformulated, and large clinical trials would have to be repeated to prove the new products are safe and effective. Meanwhile, production gaps and shortages would have to be managed, potentially for years, while manufacturers and regulators start over \u2014 all while diseases such as whooping cough, hepatitis B, and HPV-related cancers gain more room to spread.",
      "\"The aluminum adjuvants have sort of hit the sweet spot in terms of being effective at inducing a robust antibody response that is protective for those vaccines in which they're being used and being very safe,\" HogenEsch said. \"It would be quite frankly foolish to try to eliminate them.\"",
      "A century of safe use",
      "The DTaP, hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines all contain aluminum adjuvants and have been in use for nearly a century. Large-scale studies show no link between aluminum and systemic allergic disease.",
      "\"We have had aluminum adjuvants in vaccines for decades,\" Edwards said. \"I have grandchildren. My grandchildren have received all of their vaccines. And I do not worry about the safety of them.\"",
      "If aluminum is falsely cast as the villain and vaccine uptake falls, experts warn, the consequences will not be theoretical: more measles in schools, more meningitis in college dorms, and more young adults dying of cancers that HPV shots could have prevented.",
      "In their view, the real danger isn't the trace amounts of a metal that children already encounter every day. It's rolling back the protection aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines have provided for generations.",
      "That's the trade-off Offit hopes parents will see. \"A choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice,\" he said. \"It's just a choice to take a different risk.\"",

      "The granddaughter of late President John F. Kennedy,\u00a0Tatiana Schlossberg, announced Saturday that she has less than a year to live amid a cancer diagnosis.",
      "The 35-year-old journalist published an essay in the New Yorker magazine, writing that after she gave birth to her second child, a baby girl, in May 2024, doctors noticed her white-blood-cell count \"looked strange.\"",
      "She wrote in the magazine that she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3, shortly afterward. Schlossberg, who has been married to Dr. George Moran since 2017, wrote that she couldn't believe this was happening.",
      "\"I did not\u2014could not\u2014believe that they were talking about me,\" she wrote. \"I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.\"",
      "\"I had a son whom I loved more than anything and a newborn I need to take care of,\" she wrote.",
      "Schlossberg described grueling rounds of treatment including chemotherapy, several clinical trials and two bone marrow transplants, including one from her sister, Rose. But the cancer recurred, and her doctor told her he could keep her \"alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "Another tragedy hits the Kennedy family",
      "The second of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg's three children, Schlossberg said she received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. She wrote searingly in her essay of the guilt she felt over another tragedy hitting the famous Kennedy family.",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she wrote.",
      "Caroline Kennedy, who served\u00a0as the U.S. ambassador to Australia and Japan, lost her father, President John F. Kennedy, when he was assassinated\u00a0on Nov. 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald \u2014 the same day, 62 years later, her daughter published her essay announcing her cancer diagnosis. She also lost her uncle Bobby Kennedy when he was shot and killed in 1968 while he was campaigning for the presidency.",
      "Caroline Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,\u00a0died in 1994 at age 64 following a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0died in a plane crash\u00a0off the coast of Massachusetts in 1999.",
      "Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, urged people on social media\u00a0on Saturday to read Schlossberg's story to see what \"a beautiful writer, journalist, wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend\" has been going through for the last year and a half. Shriver said to let the story \"be a reminder to be grateful for the life you are living today, right now, this very minute.\"",
      "Collecting memories",
      "Schlossberg spends a portion of her essay writing about her family's dismay regarding the\u00a0nomination and confirmation\u00a0of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. She spoke about how he cut nearly half a billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines and slashed funding from the National Institutes of Health. She wrote that hundreds of National Institute of Health grants and clinical trials were canceled.",
      "She wrote that she worries millions of women might not get the care they deserve after she was given a dose of misoprostol to stop her postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can also be used as part of medication abortion, it is currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, she wrote, due to her cousin's urging.",
      "Schlossberg mostly focused on writing about her family, how she is going to miss living life with her \"kind, funny, handsome genius\" husband she managed to find, and what would happen to her two young children growing up without their mother.",
      "\"Mostly I try to live and be with them now,\" she wrote in The New Yorker. But she says that it is harder than it seems and tries to fill herself up with memories of her children, which she hopes she can carry with her after she is gone.",
      "\"Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead,\" Schlossberg wrote.",

      "Amid a growing wave of firings, resignations and retirements from the Justice Department, some former agency officials are curating a public online display of the farewell messages of ousted employees. Some of the letters from purged non-political career Justice Department attorneys warn of a threat to democracy and a crumbling of the norms and standards in federal prosecutions.",
      "Justice Connection, a group of former Justice Department employees, has organized and posted the online page of goodbye messages. The organization's executive director and founder, Stacey Young, a former civil division attorney for the Justice Department, said the Justice Department purge has now eclipsed 5,000 employees since January, including resignations, firings and retirements.",
      "Some of those ousted have included high-profile department leaders, who wrote farewell messages expressing their fears about the trajectory of the Justice Department as agency employees have been purged.",
      "\"These messages are from people who are trying to encapsulate the thought of losing their careers,\" said Peter Carr, a longtime Justice Department public affairs specialist who was fired earlier this year. Carr, now a spokesperson for Justice Connection, told CBS News, \"Somebody needed to capture all of these letters, so that they're not lost to history.\"",
      "\"These messages show what is happening in our country at this moment,\" he said.",
      "One of the messages posted was written by Maurene Comey, a former New York-based federal prosecutor, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey and previously handled part of the criminal case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. When she was fired this year, Maureen Comey wrote, \"If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain. . . . Do not let that happen.\"",
      "\"Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought,\" she continued. \"Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns at the heart of this place.\"",

      "Hagan Scotten, who resigned from the office of the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York after Justice Department leaders intervened to drop the office's criminal prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, left a blistering farewell letter to teammates.",
      "\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion, Scotten wrote. \"But it was never going to be me.\"",
      "Patty Hartman, who was fired in April from her communications position in the U.S. Attorney's Office for Washington, D.C., told CBS News she especially wanted to share a goodbye message with her team, because her firing was unexpected, abrupt and resulted in immediately losing access to her government-issued phone and computer.",
      "\"The people in charge who are supposed to protect us\u2014 our fellow Americans who we elected, along with those who were appointed, and swore an OATH to protect this nation and our Constitution \u2014 now use the Constitution as a weapon to suit their own ends,\" Hartman's farewell message said.",
      "\"When someone disappears from the office without notice, there's a tendency to think they did something wrong,\" Hartman told CBS News. \"It was important for me to publicly acknowledge my illegal termination because so many others were experiencing it and, quite frankly, I was pissed off.\"",
      "The Justice Department declined a request to comment to CBS News about the firings, resignations or the online farewell messages.",
      "Michael Romano, a prosecutor who handled some Jan. 6 prosecutions, noted his work on Capitol insurrection cases when he resigned in March.",
      "\"Many rioters saw their relationship with the rule of law as transactional, as they demonstrated when they told police officers that they had 'backed the blue' in the past and thus, that the officers should stand down or join the mob . . . .,\" he wrote in his message. \"They expected, in other words,\u00a0 that the rule of law did not apply to them. And, but for the work of the Capitol Siege Section, they would have been right.\"",
      "Romano told CBS News, \"It was important to have my colleagues see me standing up for the work we did. I needed to say it and people needed to hear it.\"",
      "Meredith Burrell, a former civil rights office attorney, wrote in her message, \"We were entrusted with the serious responsibility of engaging the power of the federal government to use the rule of law to vindicate the rights of marginalized people . . .\u00a0 I am still processing the contrast between those 25 years and the last four months.\"",
      "Other farewell messages are limited to praise of colleagues and law enforcement. Greg Rosen, who resigned in May after serving as the head of the unit that prosecuted Capitol riot cases, wrote in his message, \"To those who partnered with me on the January 6 investigation and prosecution: you represent the highest ideals of our nation\u2014unwavering in your commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power. To the officers who were injured, physically and emotionally, protecting the greatest legislative body in the world: thank you. You are the embodiment of heroism.\"",
      "Sybil Barksdale, a former official in the agency's Office of Violence against Women, wrote in her message, \"Throughout my career, through changing administrations, evolving legal landscapes, and countless initiatives, I had the privilege of working alongside exceptional colleagues who shared an unwavering dedication to justice and protecting those most vulnerable.\"",

    "summary": "Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees without input from relevant agency staffers.",
    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed Thursday to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, later said in an\u00a0interview with The New York Times\u00a0that he personally ordered the change.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer,\" Nixon said.",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that.",
      "The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed Kennedy during his confirmation hearings. Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were.",
      "\"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Cassidy wrote on social media on Thursday afternoon. \"What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\"",
      "Cassidy highlighted recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. He also called for more research into \"the real causes of autism,\" and criticized\u00a0HHS funding\u00a0cuts.",
      "\"Redirecting attention to factors we definitely know DO NOT cause autism denies families the answers they deserve,\" Cassidy wrote.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data-driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, who lresigned from the agency earlier this year.",

It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it, according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dogs-wolf-dna-breeds-study/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 07:13:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Wolf DNA seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, scientists said.",
    "story": [
      "Those tiny, fluffy dogs walking down the street may look cute but beware \u2014 they probably have some wolf in them.",
      "That is the discovery announced on Monday by U.S. scientists, who were surprised to find that nearly two thirds of all dog breeds have a detectable amount of wolf DNA.",
      "And it is not genetic leftovers from when dogs originally evolved from wolves around 20,000 years ago, but instead suggests that domesticated dogs and wild wolves have interbred within the last few thousand years.",
      "This does not mean that \"wolves are coming into your house and mixing it up with your pet dog,\" Logan Kistler, a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "It also seems to have influenced the size, smelling power and even personality of modern dog breeds, the scientists said.",
      "\"The majority of dogs today have low, but detectable levels of post domestication wolf ancestry that has shaped their evolution and conferred unique advantages to their survival in diverse human environments,\" the scientists conclude in a study published on Monday.",
      "Dogs and wolves can produce offspring together, but interbreeding is thought to be rare.",
      "\"Prior to this study, the leading science seemed to suggest that in order for a dog to be a dog, there can't be very much wolf DNA present, if any,\" lead study author Audrey Lin of the American Museum of Natural History said in a statement.",
      "To find out more, the team analyzed thousands of dog and wolf genomes in publicly available databases.",
      "They found that over 64 percent of modern breeds have wolf ancestry, with even tiny chihuahuas carrying around 0.2 percent.",
      "\"This completely makes sense to anyone who owns a chihuahua,\" Lin joked.",
      "Which dogs have the most wolf DNA?",
      "Czechoslovakian and Saarloos wolfdogs had the most wolf DNA, with up to 40 percent.",
      "For breeds used as pets, the most \"wolfy\" was the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore hound, with around five percent of wolf DNA. Sight hounds such as Salukis and Afghans also ranked high.",
      "While dogs with wolf DNA tended to be bigger, this was not always the case \u2014\u00a0Saint Bernards did not have any.",
      "The research also showed that 100 percent of village dogs \u2014 which live on human settlements but are not anyone's pet -- have wolf ancestry.",
      "Kistler speculated that village dogs, which have more opportunities to get intimate with wolves, could be how wolf DNA was getting into the dog gene pool.",
      "Female wolves separated from their wolf pack by human activities such as habitat destruction could end up breeding with stray dogs, he suggested.",
      "Overall, \"Arctic sled dogs, pariah breeds, and hunting dogs have the greatest wolf ancestry, while on average, terriers, gundogs, and scent hounds have the least,\" the researchers write.",
      "Friendly or territorial?",
      "The researchers also compared their findings to the terms that kennel clubs use to describe the personalities of different breeds.",
      "Breeds with little or no wolf in them were more likely to be described as friendly, easy to train and affectionate.",
      "On the other hand, dogs with more wolf DNA were more often considered to be suspicious of strangers, independent, dignified or territorial.",
      "However, researchers said some descriptors occurred with similar frequency in low wolf and high wolf-content dogs, including \"intelligent,\" \"obedient,\" \"good with children,\" \"dedicated,\" \"calm,\" and \"cheerful.\"",
      "Kistler emphasized that descriptions of breeds are imperfect and do not predict the behavior of any individual dog.",
      "\"Wolves are evolved for specific habitats and specific conditions, and dogs have been carried to every corner of the inhabited world by people,\" he said.",
      "Dogs have simply had to adapt to the places humans took them, and \"wolf genes that gave them advantages in certain contexts,\" he explained.",
      "For example, many Tibetan breeds, such as the fluffy little Lhasa Apso, have a gene called EPAS1 that came from adapting to higher altitudes. Tibetan wolves have the same gene.",
      "The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

      "Elon Musk's X unveiled a feature Saturday that lets users see where an account is based. Online sleuths and experts quickly found that many popular accounts posting in support of the MAGA movement to thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers, are based outside the United States \u2014 raising concerns about foreign influence on U.S. politics.",
      "Researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks online misinformation, identified several popular accounts \u2014 purportedly run by Americans interested in politics \u2013 that instead were based in Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa.",
      "The accounts were leading disseminators of some misleading and polarizing claims about U.S. politics, including ones that said Democrats bribed the moderators of a 2024 presidential debate.",
      "Nikita Bier, X's head of product, announced Saturday that the social media platform is rolling out an \"About This Account\" tool, which lets users see the country or region where an account is based. To find an account's location, tap or click the signup date displayed on the profile.",
      "\"This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,\" Bier wrote.",
      "In countries with punitive speech restrictions, a privacy tool on X lets account holders only show their region rather than a specific country. So instead of India, for instance, an account can say it is based in South Asia.",
      "Bier said Sunday that after an update to the tool, it would 99.99% accurate, though this could not be independently verified. Accounts, for instance, can use a virtual private network, or VPN, to mask their true location. On some accounts, there's a notice saying the location data may not be accurate, either because the account uses a VPN or because some internet providers use proxies automatically, without action by the user.",
      "\"Location data will always be something to use with caution,\" said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \"Its usefulness probably peaks now that it was just exposed, and bad actors will adapt. Meta has had similar information for a while and no one would suggest that misinformation has been eliminated from Facebook because of it.\"",
      "Some of the accounts supported slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as well as President Donald Trump's children. Many of the accounts were adorned with U.S. flags or made comments suggesting they were American. An account called \"@BarronTNews_,\" for instance, is shown as being located in \"Eastern Europe (Non-EU),\" even though the display location on its profile says \"Mar A Lago.\" The account, which has more than 580,000 followers, posted on Tuesday that \"This is a FAN account, 100 % independent, run by one guy who loves this country and supports President Trump with everything I've got.\"",
      "NewsGuard also found evidence that some X users are spreading misinformation about the location feature itself, incorrectly accusing some accounts of being operated from abroad when they're actually used by Americans. Investigators found several instances where one user created fake screenshots that appear to suggest an account was created overseas.",
      "It's not always clear what the motives of the accounts. While some may be state actors, it's likely that many are financially motivated, posting commentary, memes and videos to draw engagement.",
      "\"For the most visible accounts unmasked this week, money is probably the main motivator,\" Mantzarlis said. \"That doesn't mean that X \u2014 as documented extensively by prior work done by academic and nonprofit organizations that are being attacked and defunded \u2014 isn't also a target for state actors.",
      "Users were divided over the new ability to see an account's location information, with some questioning whether it went too far.",
      "\"Isn't this kind of an invasion of privacy?\" One X user wrote. \"No one needs to see this info.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has started issuing payments to eligible Prime members as part of a $2.5 billion settlement over federal allegations that it misled customers.",
      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",
      "When are payments going out?",
      "Amazon is issuing settlement refunds to eligible Prime Members, starting with automatic payments issued between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24 (see below for more details on how payments are being made).",
      "\"Our settlement required Amazon to pay those people who clearly qualify without them having to do anything,\" Christopher Bissex, deputy director of public affairs at the FTC, told CBS News. \"So those people are getting the automatic payments.\"",
      "Prime members who don't receive an automatic refund can submit a claim starting on Dec. 24. Those customers will receive a notice about filing a claim between Dec. 24 and Jan. 23, according to Bissex.",
      "How do I know if I qualify?",
      "Only customers who signed up for Amazon Prime between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, are eligible to receive a refund.",
      "Customers qualify for an automatic payment if they signed up for Prime or unsuccessfully tried to cancel their membership through Amazon's \"challenged enrollment flow,\" defined as \"any version of the Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, Prime Video enrollment flow, or the Single Page Checkout,\" according to a September\u00a0court order.",
      "The FTC also said these customers must have used no more than three \"Amazon Prime Benefits\" in a 12-month period.",
      "How do I get my payment?",

    "summary": "Burt Meyer's creations arrived in the postwar boom, when plastic molding and mass production transformed how American kids played.",
    "story": [
      "Burt Meyer, who invented toys like Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, Lite-Brite and Mouse Trap in the 1960s that delighted generations of children, has died. He was 99.",
      "Meyer's creations arrived in the postwar boom, when plastic molding and mass production transformed how American kids played. That shift opened the door for more dynamic toys, and Meyer seized the moment with designs that would stay on shelves for decades.",
      "Meyer died on Oct. 30, said Rebecca Mathis, executive director at King-Bruwaert House, a retirement community in Burr Ridge, Illinois, where he lived.",
      "Meyer succeeded by straddling two often conflicting worlds, carrying a boundless childlike imagination alongside a pragmatic understanding of machines.",
      "The idea for Lite-Brite came in 1966 when Meyer was walking in Manhattan with Marvin Glass, who owned one of the largest toy design companies at the time, and the two men passed a window display featuring hundreds of colored lights. Engineers at the company doubted that electic lights could be safely adapted for children, according to Tim Walsh, who interviewed Meyer for his 2005 book \"Timeless Toys.\"",
      "Meyer, an employee at Marvin Glass & Associates, insisted it could.",
      "\"There's billions of ideas out there,\" Walsh wrote, \"but executing them into a final creative solution is often the hard part.\"",
      "Meyer came up with a small backlit box and black paper sheets that allowed kids to create illuminated patterns. Lite-Brite was a hit, earning spots on Time Magazine's list of 100 greatest toys and in the Strong National Museum of Play's hall of fame. New versions are still being sold.",
      "Meyer had a similar role with a design team that reimagined a bulky boxing arcade game for home use. The original concept stalled in development after a featherweight boxer died from a brain injury, making any toy that invoked the tragedy unmarketable, company leaders thought.",
      "Meyer revisited the idea with a simple shift. \"This is too good to pass up,\" he recalled saying in a 2010 interview. \"Let's take it away from humanity, let's make it robots. And we won't have them fall over, we'll have something funny happen.\"",
      "The result was Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, a small game where players control the fighters' fists by pressing buttons on joysticks. A player wins by hitting the jaw of the opposing robot, theatrically popping up the spring-loaded head.",
      "The toy remained recognizable to later generations, appearing in the film \"Toy Story 2,\" and the toy company Mattel announced plans in 2021 for a live action movie adaptation.",
      "Meyer launched his own firm, Meyer/Glass Design, in the mid-1980s. The company developed numerous best-sellers including Gooey Louie, where children picked boogers our of Louie's nose, and the Pretty Pretty Princess board game. His son, Steve Meyer, ran the business until 2006, according to The New York Times.",
      "Born in 1926 as Burton Carpenter Meyer, he enlisted in the Navy and served for two years as an aircraft mechanic. After retiring from toy making, he moved to Downers Grove, a suburb of Chicago, where he built small planes and could be seen deftly steering them aloft from a nearby private airfield well into his 80s.",
      "In interviews, Meyer often drew parallels between aerospace engineering and toy design, saying both required ingenutity and teamwork.",
      "\"When you're flying the airplane, use every resource that you have in there. That's why we were able to turn out so many successful products,\" Meyer said, crediting his success to the highly collaborative environment at Marvin Glass & Associates.",
      "Meyer's car had a vanity plate that said TOYKING, and by most accounts, he was. In a 2010 interview, he said he was still delighted by telling people what he did for a living, and having them respond: \"Oh, I played with that!\"",

      "Editor's note: On July 21, 2025, a federal appeals court ruled that Pedro Hernandez must have a new trial or be released.  On Nov. 25, 2025, the Manhattan District Attorney announced he intends to retry Hernandez.",
      "This story originally aired on April 14, 2018.",
      "Etan Patz walked out of his New York City home headed for a school bus stop just two blocks away. The 6-year-old never made it to school that day in 1979 \u2013 and he's never been found.",
      "His disappearance is a story that shocked New York City and to this day haunts law enforcement investigators who have spent decades trying to find him. The disappearance of the young boy is more than a missing person's case. Indeed, it changed the way parents watched over their kids.",
      "\"I think this was one of the most significant unsolved cases in the history of New York City,\" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. tell \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger.",
      "\"Every missing child case is very important, but this was one of the oldest ones we had,\" says NYPD Lieutenant Chris Zimmerman.",
      "Etan Patz disappeared at a time long before social media and every storefront had a video camera. He had asked his parents to let him do the short walk to the bus stop alone for the first time. He had a dollar to buy a soda at a corner deli. His parents were unaware he was missing until he didn't return home after school. Since then, Patz's smiling image used on missing person's fliers is seared into the minds of people around the country.",
      "\"That photo will always haunt me. And every single day that I sent my son out to school, I thought of Etan Patz,\" says attorney Brian O'Dwyer. \"And I was one of eight million New Yorkers like that.\"",
      "Police began searching for Patz by going door to door. Over the years, the case would grow cold. But there was one neighborhood man police suspected of being a pedophile, whom they had their eye on almost from the beginning: Jose Ramos. Ramos, according to law enforcement, had said he took a child back to his apartment and molested him. Ramos told them he was 90 percent sure it was Patz. The case against Ramos, however, lacked corroboration, and never moved forward, says Vance.",
      "Vance vowed to take a fresh look at Etan's disappearance when he took office in 2010. \"I was on the hunt for the Patz family to find the killer,\" he says.",
      "Then in 2012, the NYPD got a tip from a relative of Pedro Hernandez, saying Hernandez had talked about hurting a boy around the time Patz disappeared. During questioning by police, Hernandez told them he choked a boy. He later took them to locations near the Patz home. Was Hernandez telling the truth?",
      "\"The facts of that confession make no sense,\" says Hernandez's attorney Harvey Fishbein. \"He's unreliable because of his psychiatric condition.\"",
      "What happened to Etan Patz?",
      "THE SEARCH FOR ETAN",
      "After more than 30 years, it took a new team of investigators and a new prosecutor to breathe new life into an old case \u2013 trying to find out what happened to Etan Patz.",
      "District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.:\u00a0 You really should never close the book on a case if you think there's the possibility that it can be solved.",
      "In 2012, investigators were literally digging for clues just blocks away from where Etan was last seen. \u00a0After thousands of dead-end leads, the public held its collective breath hoping, this time, the case might finally be solved.",
      "Etan Patz was just 6 years old, and like many kids that age, he wanted some independence. It was 1979, the last day of school before the Memorial Day weekend, and Etan's mother, Julie, finally agreed to let Etan walk alone to the school bus stop. It was just two blocks away from their Manhattan apartment.",
      "Julie Patz | Etan's mother [1980]: Yes, I wish I hadn't let him go to the bus stop that morning alone. \u2026My feelings that morning were very positive about his going.",
      "Etan was carrying a book bag and a dollar to buy a soda at a corner store near the bus stop \u2013 and then, he seemed to vanish.",
      "Julie and her husband Stan didn't realize their son was missing until that afternoon when he didn't come home from school. Julie called the school and learned Etan never arrived and his friends never saw him at the bus stop. So she called the police.",

      "Etan's image was splashed on storefronts and in newspapers. Etan's father is a professional photographer and took many photos of his son. The pictures captured the public's heart\u2014and captured Etan's spirit.",
      "Julie Patz [1980]: He's just bubbling over with life and \u2026 He always saw the positive side when other people saw negative.\u00a0 He is just an incredible person.",
      "Stan Patz [1980]: Our 6-year-old boy's a loving, trusting child. \u2026We think an adult could have convinced him to come with him.",
      "The police canvassed the neighborhood, talking to people on the street and interviewing workers at a corner store near the school bus stop.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: The longer we've gone without any bad news, I think that's good.",
      "Detective Bill Butler was Eanniello's partner.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: We have leads, but we don't know where we're gonna end up on the leads that we have now.",
      "Det. Bill Butler [1980]: When you go this long on something like this, you do, you feel like you're looking for your own son.",
      "The search for Etan dragged on. Detective Butler, a father with six children, lived and breathed the case.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: How did this case influence Bill Butler?",
      "Patrick Eanniello: More than I could imagine. He was very, very tied into the case.",
      "In 1986, Bill Butler took his own life. There was speculation Butler's frustration with this case may have been part of the reason why.",
      "The search went on without Butler. Julie and Stan had two other children to protect: Etan's older sister and younger brother.",
      "Julie Patz [1980]: We keep saying we try to lead normal lives, but in so many small ways, it's just totally impossible, I mean we have his belongings all over the house \u2026 And yet to put them away is saying to us and our children he's gone and not coming back.",
      "Stan Patz [1980]: And if we are patient we'll get him back.",
      "But their patience went unrewarded.",
      "The Patz's did everything they could to keep their story in the news. And that helped other missing children.",
      "In the 1980s, milk cartons showed Etan's face, and then, those of others. But Etan remained among the missing.",
      "By 1998, a new detective was heading the Missing Persons Squad. Phil Mahony was drawn to the case by, of all things, a poem titled \"The Missing Boy\" by Sharon Olds -- about a mother and son looking at Etan's missing poster.",
      "Phil Mahony: And -- I read that poem and I said, [snaps fingers] \"That's it. \u2026I wanna work on the Etan Patz case.",
      "Phil Mahony: It was pretty much inactive and had been inactive for many years.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: It was cold?",
      "Phil Mahony: It was colder than cold \u2026 we had to find the reports and put them back together.",
      "Mahony sorted through nearly two decades worth of work\u00a0 -- and some bizarre tips.",

      "Richard Schlesinger: Did that source say that Etan was -- there, at that cult?",
      "Phil Mahony: Yeah, that Etan was killed by that cult and dumped.",
      "The leads led nowhere. But, there was someone who police were very interested in: Jose Ramos, the man who said he may have encountered a boy in Washington Square Park, not far from where the Patz's lived.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did he say it was Etan Patz?",
      "Phil Mahony He has said he was 90 percent sure it was Etan Patz.",
      "A PERSON OF INTEREST?",
      "In 1982, Jose Ramos was picked up by police for stealing some books from children. He was homeless, living in a drainage tunnel in New York City. Former Lieutenant Phil Mahony recalls Ramos had some disturbing photos.",
      "Phil Mahony: He had a bunch of -- photos \u2026 of kids that looked like Etan Patz. \u2026He was -- a shady character so he enjoyed lookin' at these photos.",

      "ASSISTANT D.A. \u00a0FRANK CARROLL [evidence tape]: Did you ever hear of a kid named Etan Patz?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: Yeah, that was in the papers in '79.",
      "ADA FRANK CARROLL: What is about \u2026 that people say looks like Etan?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: The smile, I think.",
      "ADA FRANK CARROLL: How about the hair?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: Maybe the hair. Not that much\u2026",
      "JOSE RAMOS: Susan used to take care of him, Susan Harrington.",
      "Susan Harrington, Ramos's girlfriend, walked Etan to school during a bus strike shortly before Etan disappeared.",
      "ADA FRANK CARROLL: Did you know where he lived?",
      "JOSE RAMOS: In SoHo. Well, it was in the papers.",
      "Investigators suspected Ramos was a pedophile who could have ties to Etan.",
      "Phil Mahony: There was enough there, there was a lot there to draw attention to him certainly.",
      "Etan often played in Washington Square Park -- a place Ramos was known to visit.",
      "Phil Mahony: Jose Ramos \u2026 has said several times that on May 25, 1979 \u2026 he was here \u2026 when a young, small, sevenish \u2026 blond kid came up to him and started talkin' to him. And Jose Ramos said at that point he eventually took the kid back to his apartment.",
      "Ramos told that story to Federal Prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who had been working the case since 1985. GraBois and the FBI had, through the years, tracked leads around the world. But they always came back to Ramos.",
      "Stuart GraBois: In June 1988, Ramos was brought to my office \u2026 and proceeded to state \u2026 that he was 90 percent sure that the young boy he took that day, May 25,1979, was the same boy whose picture he saw both in the newspaper and on television\u00a0 -- \u00a0that being Etan Patz.",
      "Investigators learned Ramos had sexually molested children around the country.",
      "Stuart GraBois: One of the things he did is travel around the United States in a converted school bus, giving out Matchbox cars and toys and baseball cards to children -- to young boys to entice them onto the bus.",
      "GraBois wanted to prosecute Ramos even if it wasn't for the Etan Patz case. He succeeded in Pennsylvania. In 1990, Ramos pleaded guilty to molesting an 8-year old boy and was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: You've got a known pedophile who says he was 90 percent sure he picked up Etan Patz, you know-- around the time he disappeared. Why didn't you just go,\" OK, case closed\"?",
      "Phil Mahony: Because we didn't have that corroborated evidence -- didn't have that one person who said, \"Yeah, I saw him and Etan in Washington Square Park.\"",
      "Investigators hunted for more evidence. In 2000, Mahony ordered a search of an apartment building Ramos lived in when Etan disappeared. Ramos had allegedly told a fellow inmate this is where he disposed of Etan's body.",
      "Phil Mahony: When he was in jail, Jose Ramos said \u2026 that he put Etan into the furnace in the basement.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Of this building?",
      "Phil Mahony: Of this building, and you know, burned up the body.",
      "But like so many tips in the Etan Patz case, nothing came of it.",
      "Phil Mahony: \u2026there was just never that next thing to make you say, \"Yup, that's it. Close the books, we got the guy.\"",
      "Mahony felt they didn't have enough on Ramos to charge him with Etan's disappearance. Neither did the Manhattan D.A. at the time. But Stan Patz and Stuart GraBois were becoming more convinced Ramos was their man.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I believe this man stalked my son. I believe he lured him back to his apartment. I think he used him like toilet paper and I think he threw him away [emotional].",
      "Brian O'Dwyer is a prominent N.Y. attorney and started representing the Patz's. He was friends with Stuart GraBois, and in 2000 he approached GraBois with an idea.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: And I said, you know, you have an opportunity -- you may not have \u2026 thought about it, but of taking a civil case against Ramos.",
      "It would be a wrongful death suit. O'Dwyer hoped Ramos would be subpoenaed and might say something incriminating to help bring a criminal case. But before the wrongful death case could proceed, O'Dwyer had to ask the Patz's to officially give up hope. They would have to ask a court to declare their son dead.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: It's one of the toughest things I've ever done in my practice.",
      "And, on June 19, 2001, a judge declared that Etan Patz was officially dead.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I used to have fantasies of a taxi cab -- pulling up in front, and Etan coming out of it. But -- that was a long time ago. I don't entertain those fantasies any more.",
      "The Patz's attorney went to the Pennsylvania prison where Ramos was being held to interview the man he believed had killed Etan Patz.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: This was evil incarnate. \u2026If I had met him on the street I would have been very scared.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And what did he say?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: He said that yes, indeed, he was on the street that day. And he picked up a little boy by the name of Jimmy.",
      "This time, Ramos did not say Etan's name.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Were you convinced that Ramos was the guy?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: Absolutely.",
      "Ramos would never answer more questions or testify in court, and the Patz's won the civil case against him.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer [to reporters in 2001]: Once and for all we have a final declaration by a court of law that Jose\u00a0 Antonio Ramos caused the death of Etan Patz.",
      "It was a victory, but it was not the end of the fight.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: The ultimate objective was to get a criminal prosecution",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Did you think it was enough to prosecute him criminally?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: I did.",
      "The Manhattan D.A. disagreed. He still would not charge Jose Ramos.",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: He thought he couldn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Do you keep thinking about this case, or did you move on?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: No, I never moved on. Never moved on --",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Really?",
      "Brian O'Dwyer: No. Jose Antonio Ramos was in prison, unpunished, for what I believed was the death of Etan Patz.",
      "But 33 years after Etan disappeared there was a tip -- and it could change everything in this case.",
      "A TURNING POINT",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I \u2013 [sighs, emotional] I think about my son every day. He's -- gone, but I will never forget him.",
      "As time passed for Stan and Julie Patz, Etan was, and is, frozen in time as a 6-year-old gone missing. They remained convinced that Jose Ramos, the pedophile who was behind bars in Pennsylvania, was responsible for Etan's death.",
      "Stan Patz [2000]: I send him a -- poster twice a year. \u2026and I write on the back, \"What did you do to my little boy?\"",
      "From the time Etan disappeared in 1979 until 2009, one man held the position of Manhattan District Attorney: Robert Morgenthau. He never felt there was enough evidence to indict Ramos. But Morgenthau was retiring, and Cyrus Vance Jr. was running for the office.",
      "Cyrus Vance Jr.: The Patz family reached out to me. \u2026And Stan \u2026 asked me if I would -- look into the case.",
      "And when Vance became Manhattan D.A. in 2010, he did look into it.",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: Cy Vance was like, \"Listen, we'd like to re -- you know, fresh set of eyes, relook at it, go backwards, see what was missed.\"",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman headed the Missing Persons Squad at the time, and part of the fresh look included another look at Jose Ramos.",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: We looked at the case for quite a while and I never was convinced \u2026 that there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Jose Ramos was Etan's killer.",
      "And so the search for another suspect continued.",
      "The FBI had been involved on and off since Etan's disappearance.\u00a0 In April 2012, investigators took another look at a handyman who used to work for the Patz's. Along with the NYPD, they started that dig. It was at the former site of the handyman's workshop.",
      "FBI Agent\u00a0[to reporters]: We're executing a search warrant regarding the disappearance of Etan Patz.",
      "It was not far from where the Patz's still lived.",
      "The dig went on for five days, as investigators sifted through subterranean spaces and decades-old dirt. It was starting to look like there might finally be some answers. In the end, nothing was found. The handyman was cleared. But this was not just another dead end \u2013 it was far from it. In fact, it led to the first major turning point in this case.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: The call comes into our office, onto the phone right next to my desk.",
      "It came from Jose Lopez, who called police after he watched news coverage of the dig. He said his brother-in-law might be involved in the case.",
      "Detective Dave Ramirez helped lead the investigation.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Who was his brother-in-law?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Pedro Hernandez.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Had you ever heard the name Pedro Hernandez before?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No, sir, no.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: What did he tell you about his brother-in-law?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: That he had made -- statements to various people about him having done something really bad to a child in New York.",
      "Pedro Hernandez worked as a stock boy at that corner store by the bus stop. He was 18 when Etan disappeared. And soon after, Hernandez left that job and moved home to New Jersey. \u00a0Over the years, he had been divorced, remarried and had children. He worked on and off at menial jobs and had no criminal record. But he had told people about hurting an unnamed child.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So who had Hernandez spoken to?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: There was a religious group, apparently there was a retreat that they had gone on \u2026 they all had \u2013 information \u2026 to the fact that Mr. Hernandez did something to this child.",
      "Ramirez learned Hernandez also told his ex-wife and a friend, similar stories. \u00a0Detective's notes from 1979 show police at the time knew Hernandez worked at the store, but it is unclear if he was ever questioned.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Why do you suppose he was not a suspect before?",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: I don't have the answer for it. I wasn't there. You know, I -- I never got clarity on that and I don't think he did either.",
      "About two weeks after they learned about Hernandez, on May 23, 2012, police went to his New Jersey home to talk to him.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: I had -- told him that we were investigating an old \u2026 missing persons case \u2026 in New York City. \u2026At that point, he like, he lost all the color in his face.",
      "Still, Hernandez readily agreed to go to the prosecutor's office in Camden, N.J. to be questioned.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Was it hard to get him talking?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: No, no.",
      "He talked for six hours without a lawyer or a recording of the conversation. During that time, he was shown a missing poster of Etan Patz. Later, the video camera was turned on and Hernandez told them about seeing a boy outside the store where he worked:",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Can you start telling us again exactly what you just told us before, about what happened.",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: He was waiting for the school bus.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Who was waiting for the school bus?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: The kid.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What's his name?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: Etan Patz.",
      "These are the words that changed the course of one of America's most heartbreaking cold cases. Hernandez went on, telling police he offered Etan a soda:",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: And then I ask him -- I ask him to go to the, in the basement with me to get the soda.",
      "It is hard to listen to his story:",
      "SECOND INVESTIGATOR: And then what happened after that?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: And then I choke him \u2026 Yeah, when I choked him he went like this [puts his hands to his throat, then goes limp and drops his arms to his side].",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What made you do this?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: I don't know.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: You don't know?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: \u2026It was something that it just happened.",
      "He signs Etan's missing poster, writing: \"I am sorry \u2026 and \"choke him\"",
      "INVESTIGATOR: And you recognize this to be the boy that you choked that day?",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ: Yes.",
      "After the confession, Hernandez showed investigators where he said it happened 33 years earlier.\u00a0 Lt. Zimmerman recorded the walk with his cellphone:",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So Hernandez told you here that this was the basement entrance\u2026",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: So according to Hernandez, Etan was \u2026 that way from where we are.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And he lured him in -- into the basement through this door.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Yes, sir.",

      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Put him in a box.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And then put the box on his shoulder.",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: Carry the box up out here \u2026 At this point, I said \"could you show us exactly the way you walked that day?\" We crossed the street to the other side.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: And how far down did he go?",
      "Det. Dave Ramirez: And then he went down to the corner.",
      "Hernandez showed them where he says he disposed of a box with Etan's body.",
      "Police believe the box was picked up by garbage collectors. Hernandez was interviewed again hours after the SoHo walk, this time by a prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.'s office:",
      "PEDRO HERNANDEZ [to Asst. DA]: Then I choked him. And I tried to let go, but I just couldn't let him go.",
      "He repeated the same story. And later that day, Pedro Hernandez was arrested.",

      "Cyrus Vance Jr:\u00a0 He had confessed to killing Etan Patz. It was a credible confession.",
      "So says the prosecutor. But soon, questions were being asked about the six hours when Hernandez was questioned before the videotaping began.",
      "Richard Schlesinger [to Vance]: Why weren't those first hours videotaped?",
      "UNDER ARREST",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: It was a day or two shy of the 33rd anniversary. It was a day or two shy that we made the arrest.",

      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman [to reporters]: \u00a0Mr. Patz was taken aback, a little surprised and I would say\u00a0 overwhelmed.",
      "Lt. Chris Zimmerman: You know, it had to sink in. You know, 30-something years, it had to sink in. \u2026I can't imagine not having an answer for that many years.",
      "For decades, Stan and Julie Patz believed another man was responsible for their son's disappearance in 1979.",

      "Now, someone was admitting it. But it was Pedro Hernandez.",

      "Richard Schlesinger: You think? Are you sure?",
      "Harvey Fishbein: It's hard to look into someone's mind, which is one of the real problems we have here.",
      "The diagnosis of mental illness would be a major part of Hernandez's defense. \u00a0In January 2015, two- and-a-half years after his arrest, Hernandez went on trial for the murder of Etan Patz.",
      "NEWS REPORT: Etan Patz's father walked silently past reporters in the courthouse ... finally hoping to see justice served nearly 36 years after his young son's disappearance.",

      "Harvey Fishbein: Pedro says, \"I saw him standing there.\"",
      "Harvey Fishbein: Yet, no parent that was at the bus stop that morning who knew Etan, saw Etan that morning. \u2026So the fact that Pedro said that he saw the child there when no one else did immediately raises questions as to did this actually happen or not?",

      "Harvey Fishbein: That bag was never recovered.",
      "The defense also argued that Hernandez has a low IQ and is susceptible to suggestions.",
      "Harvey Fishbein: We -- argued to the jury that \u2026 He's unreliable because of his low intellect. \u2026because of his psychiatric condition. And \u2026 'cause the story in the end does not make sense.",
      "But the prosecution experts interviewed Hernandez and concluded he is not mentally ill, and that the jury could believe his words.",
      "Prosecutors had home videos showing Hernandez socializing like anyone else. And they pointed out that Hernandez never reported any mental illness on a driver's license renewal form he filled out.",
      "Richard Schlesinger: Do you believe that he was competent to confess?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: Absolutely. \u2026I think there was ample evidence that Pedro Hernandez was not \u2013 fabricating \u2013 this -- homicide as the product of mental illness, but that he in fact was -- admitting to something that had tortured him \u2026 and he confessed.",

      "Richard Schlesinger: How do you know that they didn't feed him information? How do you know they didn't berate him?",
      "D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr.: The way you assure yourself is by talking to the witnesses who were there. \u2026 after speaking to those who were present and being informed of what happened, I did not doubt that there was anything but a fair handling of Mr. Hernandez and appropriate questioning of him.",

      "But Fishbein told the jury those accounts varied and Hernandez may have been making them up to look tough. And he offered the jurors another suspect; the man many, including the Patz's, first thought killed Etan: Jose Ramos, the known pedophile whose girlfriend knew Etan.",

    "summary": "The FBI has ruled the woman out as a suspect in the 2021 plot, sources said, but only after her name circulated on social platforms and a conservative news site.",
    "story": [
      "A federal security officer linked to a thwarted Jan. 6 pipe bomb attack cleared her name by providing an alibi: video of her playing with her puppies at the time the devices were placed, sources told CBS News. The FBI has now ruled her out as a suspect in the 2021 plot, according to three sources \u2014 but only after her name circulated on social platforms and a conservative news site.",
      "How an innocent woman's name came to be publicly linked to the unexploded pipe bombs is a question that has raised concerns among some senior officials in the Trump administration.",
      "CBS News is not naming the security officer or her workplace. The federal agency she protects declined to comment.",
      "Multiple sources said that a unit overseen by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard drafted a memo identifying the woman and describing allegations that she had placed the explosive devices outside Democratic and Republican party offices. The memo was written after ODNI was made aware of allegations from an outside source, an ODNI spokesperson said.",
      "ODNI officials said the agency received a tip from a person affiliated with a media organization about potential criminal wrongdoing by an individual believed to be working at an intelligence agency and set about documenting it in a memo.",
      "A copy of the unfinished memo was given to senior staff at the security officer's workplace, sources said.",
      "It also circulated among a few Trump administration officials, building expectations that the nearly five-year-old case might be solved. But the memo caught some officials at the FBI, Justice Department and White House off guard, the sources said.",
      "ODNI oversees the nation's foreign intelligence gathering and has limited domestic investigative authorities. The FBI is leading the pipe bomb investigation.",
      "A short time after the unfinished memo began to circulate, the conservative news outlet, Blaze News, published details similar to those in the draft, including the woman's full name.",
      "The Nov. 8 Blaze News article claimed that it had pinpointed the woman after a review of video evidence and \"gait analysis\" software matched her walking pattern to the gait of a person shown in surveillance footage, who authorities suspect planted bombs outside the party offices on Jan. 5, 2021.",
      "Blaze News said its work had been \"confirmed by several intelligence sources.\"",
      "Several sources told CBS News that the classified draft memo, which was on ODNI letterhead, was written by Paul McNamara, who is in charge of Gabbard's Director's Initiatives Group, which is tasked with providing \"transparency and accountability\" and executing President Trump's intelligence-related executive orders. McNamara could not be reached for comment.",
      "A spokesperson, Olivia Coleman, said, \"ODNI followed its obligation to report information received concerning the alleged activities of a member of the Intelligence Community to that person's employing agency.\"",
      "\"After a whistleblower came forward with an allegation, ODNI documented the accusation and lawfully reported it, fulfilling our legal duty to alert appropriate agencies when alleged/potential security concerns are brought to our attention,\" Coleman said. \"There were no predetermined conclusions or assessments made, and every action taken was done so in consultation with legal counsel.\"",
      "The Blaze report became the subject of extensive media coverage and discussion on social media, especially among supporters of Mr. Trump.",
      "Word of this supposed break in the case reached Mr. Trump, two of the sources said, although it's unclear how he learned of it.",
      "The bomb-planting incident is one of the lingering mysteries surrounding the events around the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, on the eve of the Jan. 6 riot. Nearly five years since the pipe bombs were placed, no suspect has been arrested or identified. The FBI said the bombs were viable, but they did not detonate.",
      "CBS News was not shown the memo, but sources said McNamara had accessed confidential files to obtain details about the woman for the draft memo, including her place of work and Social Security number.",
      "Gabbard, the top ODNI official, has since distanced herself from the memo, telling senior officials that the information about the woman spread without her knowledge while Gabbard was traveling abroad, several sources said.",
      "An ODNI official also said the draft memo hadn't been reviewed or approved by agency leadership.",
      "Sources said this situation, and others, were viewed internally by some senior administration officials as interfering in areas that were beyond the purview of the national intelligence director's office. Axios reported in September that Justice Department officials believed ODNI had hindered their case against former CIA Director John Brennan. The New York Times in October reported that ODNI had accessed FBI investigative files related to Charlie Kirk's assassination, searched for evidence of conspiracies and potentially undermined the government's case against the alleged assassin.",
      "The federal security officer cooperated with the FBI, sources close to the matter said. Her lawyer said publicly she had done nothing wrong. Both the woman and her lawyer declined to comment.",
      "She returned to work after being placed on a brief leave, one of the sources said.",
      "An FBI spokesperson and representatives for Blaze News didn't respond to requests for comment. Blaze News updated its story with one correction and further information, but it remains online.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:49:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Past-due balances are becoming a reality for many U.S. households as they struggle to keep up with costlier utility bills.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new\u00a0joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.",
      "In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.",
      "More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to\u00a0rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.",
      "\"When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,\" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.",
      "Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing\u00a0share are using electricity.",
      "A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.",
      "The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.",
      "More Americans at risk of shutoffs",
      "When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.",
      "Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.",
      "While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.",
      "\"Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,\" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.",
      "Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.",
      "Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.",
      "\"When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,\" Wolfe told CBS News. \"That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.\"",

      "The groups are suing for a preliminary injunction to avert the closure of the Community Relations Service, which was launched in 1964 to avert rioting and racial strife in American communities.",
      "The office has been known informally as \"America's Peacemaker.\"",

      "\"Rather than pursue legislation to eliminate the agency, however, (the Justice Department) set out to destroy the Community Relations Service unilaterally,\" the lawsuit said. \"Defendants did so behind closed doors, without notice or public input, and without consulting the communities that depend on the Community Relations Service.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice refuses to follow the law \u2014 and it cannot offer any coherent explanation for its actions,\" the lawsuit also said. \"Instead, the Executive Branch is brazenly defying Congress.\"",
      "President John F. Kennedy conceived of the office in the early 1960s, saying the federal government should have experts who can \"identify tensions before they reach the crisis stage\" and \"work quietly to ease tensions and improve relations in any community threatened or torn with strife.\"",
      "The office has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest. It was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged after the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also worked to ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, in Akron, Ohio, in 2022, after the shooting of a Black man by police and deploying twice to Minneapolis during the trial of Derek Chauvin after the killing of George Floyd in 2020 in Minnesota.",
      "The newly filed lawsuit also includes details of the office's history, pointing out that in the 1970s, CRS had been \"involved in mediating school desegregation conflicts\" and played a major role in helping Boston address the busing crisis that arose during desegregation.",
      "Kyle Freeny, a senior attorney with the Washington Litigation Group, is representing the civil rights groups in their lawsuit.",
      "\"The Community Relations Service was not an abstract government agency to these plaintiffs,\" Freeny told CBS News. \"It was an active partner helping them mediate racial tensions, support faith communities, protect vulnerable students and address discrimination in real time. By dismantling CRS, the government cut off proven, irreplaceable support that these organizations depended on to carry out their missions.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.",
      "In a speech in July 2024, Justin Lock, a former director of the Community Relations Service, lauded the office's accomplishments, saying it had been \"at the intersection of some of the most critical moments in our nation's journey toward justice.\"",
      "\"In 2020, when Americans marched in solidarity with the people of Brunswick, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, CRS engaged with communities as an impartial, confidential facilitator, helping stakeholders identify and implement solutions that help communities to heal and move forward,\" Locke said.",

The legislation enacted a bevy of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025, including eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "\"When people go to file, they'll be surprised by really, really large refunds,\" Don Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler and one of the report's authors, said in a recent podcast about the analysis. \"In a typical year, we might have about $270 billion in tax refunds, and it'll be that plus another $90 billion.\"",
      "Americans generally aren't adjusting their withholding to reflect the new law's retroactive tax cuts, largely because it's hard for employees to estimate the impact, Schneider added. As a result, when people file their taxes in early 2026, their refunds could be about one-third larger than usual \u2014 that amounts to roughly an extra $1,000 per filer, according to the report's calculations.",
      "\"It could be one of the largest tax refund seasons ever,\" Schneider added.",
      "Still, the impact won't be evenly distributed, with the benefits largely going toward middle- and upper-middle-income households, or those earning between $60,000 to $400,000 per year, according to Piper Sandler.",
      "That echoes earlier tax analyses projecting that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. People who earn over $217,000 a year are likely to get $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the law, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Some of the law's benefits won't reach the highest-earning households because of income phase-outs, Piper Sandler noted. For example, the new $40,000 SALT deduction begins to phase out for filers with annual income of more than $500,000.",
      "The lowest-earning households are also likely to see little benefit from parts of the new tax law. For instance, the higher SALT deduction cap only helps people whose state and local taxes exceed the 2025 standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples.",
      "Because filers must itemize to claim the SALT deduction, lower-income households typically can't take advantage of it, according to tax experts.",
      "\"This isn't going to the very bottom of the distribution. It isn't going to the very top of the distribution either,\" Scheider said.",

    "story": [
      "A decades-old New Hampshire cold case has been solved with modern DNA testing, authorities said Monday.",
      "Judith Lord, 22, was found dead in her Concord apartment on May 20, 1975 when a staff member entered the unit to collect unpaid rent, according to a news release from the New Hampshire Department of Justice. The staff member also heard a baby crying inside the unit, according to the state\u00a0attorney general's report.",
      "Investigators determined that there had been a violent struggle, and that Lord had been sexually assaulted and strangled to death. Her 20-month-old son was found unharmed in his crib in another room of the apartment.",
      "Investigators recovered forensic evidence, including hair and seminal fluid, from the crime scene, authorities said. Investigators focused on three suspects: Lord's estranged husband and two neighbors. Her husband had an alibi and no evidence tied him to the crime scene, according to the attorney general's report. One of the neighbors was excluded as a suspect for the same reason.",
      "The investigation began to focus on Lord's next-door neighbor, Ernest Theodore Gable, who was 24 at the time. He lived next door to Lord with his wife, and their apartments shared a wall, according to the attorney general's report. Multiple witnesses told police that Lord was afraid of Gable. His fingerprints were found on the outside of Lord's windows.",
      "Physical evidence was collected from Gable, and hairs were submitted to the FBI's Forensic Laboratory for microscopic comparison. The test \"led to an incorrect conclusion that the suspect could not have contributed the hairs found at the scene,\" the news release said, contradicting other evidence in the case.",
      "The state of New Hampshire had been prepared to indict and prosecute Gable, according to the attorney general's report, but the FBI report \"created a significant evidentiary hurdle that prosecutors felt they could not overcome.\" The investigation was \"effectively halted,\" the report said, and the case stalled for decades.",
      "The case was reopened decades later. DNA testing found that the seminal fluids found on towels were a match for Gable, according to the attorney general's report. The microscopic hair comparison test results remained an issue until 2015, when the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice formally acknowledged that nearly all uses of the test had led to flawed testimony or reports. New forensic testing correctly identified the hairs as belonging to Gable.",
      "Gable was stabbed to death in Los Angeles in February 1987, at 36 years old, according to the news release. Lord's case will be formally closed and classified as solved. If Gable were still alive, \"the Cold Case Unit would pursue alternative charges of First Degree Murder, both for knowingly causing Ms. Lord's death during the commission of aggravated felonious sexual assault, and for purposely causing her death by strangulation,\" the news release said.",
      "\"It is my hope that this long-awaited conclusion will finally bring peace and closure to Judy Lord's family and the entire Concord community after nearly five decades of delayed justice,\" said New Hampshire attorney general John Formella. \"This resolution proves that no cold case is ever truly closed until the truth is found. The original Concord Police Department investigators showed extraordinary diligence, only to be thwarted by flawed forensic technology of the era. We commend the Cold Case Unit, the Concord Police Department, and all of our partners for their commitment to resolving this case and correcting a historic injustice.\"",

    "summary": "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
    "story": [
      "Two turkeys headed Tuesday from the posh Willard Hotel to the White House, becoming the latest turkeys to be pardoned by an American president in a tradition that officially dates back to President George H.W. Bush.",
      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump pardoned Gobble and Waddle, with Waddle ready to stand in if Gobble cannot perform his duties. Mr. Trump issued Gobble a \"complete and unconditional pardon, telling the turkey \"God bless you.\"",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "Mr. Trump will be traveling to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, as he did nearly every Thanksgiving in his first term. Former President Joe Biden, meanwhile, traveled to Nantucket over the weekend, per his daughter's Instagram, a Biden family tradition for\u00a0over 40 years.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 11:17:37 -0500",
    "summary": "The 2025 hurricane season is drawing to a close without a single one making landfall in the continental United States.",
    "story": [
      "The 2025 hurricane season is drawing to a close without a single one making landfall in the continental United States \u2014 for the first time in a decade.",
      "After developing in tropical Atlantic waters near the equator, multiple storms this year initially appeared to be following paths that could have taken them toward the U.S. East Coast. But as they got closer, all of the systems that formed since the start of the season on June 1 ultimately veered northward and traveled back out to sea.",
      "\"They began to turn northward, away from the U.S. coastline, over and over again. We saw that repeatedly,\" said Greg Postel, a meteorologist at The Weather Channel. \"It was really the dominant mode of the hurricane tracks this year.\"",
      "It was an unusual phenomenon, at least compared with recent years. Postel said many who studied this hurricane season will likely remember it as \"the year of the 'recurvature,'\" which is when hurricanes \"curve\" away from land instead of striking it. That pattern can result from a variety of atmospheric conditions interacting with each other, according to Postel and other experts.",
      "Winds and air pressure",
      "All told, this hurricane season brought 13 named storms \u2014 four of which were major hurricanes. September and October saw four hurricanes alone, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, striking Jamaica as one of the strongest on record.",
      "But none of those hurricanes hit the U.S. directly. Only a single tropical storm, Chantal, came ashore in July near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, causing flash floods that knocked out power, damaged buildings and left at least four people dead, authorities said at the time.",
      "And while there's technically still time for another hurricane before the season officially ends on Nov. 30, a named storm hasn't formed this late in the year since at least 1991, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Experts point to winds and air pressure as key factors in this year's hurricane movement.",
      "Hurricanes tend to travel westward from an origin point in the tropical Atlantic, but certain atmospheric conditions that steer the storms in one direction or another can cause them to \"recurve\" toward the east, said Matthew Rosencrans, the lead hurricane season forecaster at the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center. Those conditions essentially sweep hurricanes northward, parallel to the East Coast of the U.S., before pushing them back out to sea.",
      "\"When I look at the steering currents, the winds that determine where the hurricanes go at the core of the season, there was basically a big upper-level trough \u2014 an area of low pressure that hung out over the eastern U.S.,\" Rosencrans told CBS News. \"It's spinning out there, and it's picking up these storms and causing them to go more to the north rather than continue their track to the west and potentially enter the Caribbean or the Gulf, at which point they're almost guaranteed to hit the U.S.\"",
      "The area of low pressure weakened part of something known as the Bermuda High, which is among the leading forces influencing a hurricane's path. Where and when a hurricane is steered, and whether it travels northward, depends on the strength and location of the Bermuda High during a hurricane season, according to NOAA's hurricane research division.",
      "Also called a \"subtropical high,\" the Bermuda High is a ridge of high pressure in the North Atlantic where air circulates in a clockwise direction. A strong Bermuda High pushes hurricanes farther west before turning them northward, toward Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, whereas a weaker Bermuda high turns them northward sooner, either toward the East Coast or out to sea.",
      "The upper-level trough that lingered over the East Coast took shape in tandem with a dip in the jet stream, which together produced a low-pressure area close to the surface of the ocean just several hundred miles from land, said Rosencrans. That weakened the western part of the Bermuda High, just several hundred miles from the shores of the continental U.S., and pushed the high-pressure ridge in the opposite direction.",
      "Postel noted that such a pattern in the jet stream \"is very good at deflecting incoming tropical systems out to sea.\"",
      "\"Why [the dip in the jet stream] was there globally, in the sort of scheme of the general circulation, is not entirely clear, but it's certainly something that characterized this hurricane season,\" he said. \"Because without it, without that trough there in those crucial moments, we would have looked back on this hurricane season very, very differently.\"",
      "Previous years without continental U.S. landfalls",
      "A full season without any hurricane landfalls isn't unheard of, although it is fairly uncommon. In the last 25 years, excluding this one, there were seven in which no hurricanes struck the mainland U.S.: 2000, 2001, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2015, according to the hurricane research division at NOAA.",
      "Data show no hurricanes made U.S. landfall in 1990 or 1994, either.",
      "Recent hurricane seasons by the numbers",
      "2024: Five hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 19 total named storms, including 11 hurricanes.2023: One hurricane made landfall in the U.S. There were 19 named storms, including seven hurricanes.2022: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 17 named storms, including eight hurricanes.2021: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 21 named storms, including seven hurricanes.2020: Six hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 31 named storms, including 14 hurricanes.2019: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 20 named storms, including six hurricanes.2018: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 16 named storms, including eight hurricanes.2017: Three hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 19 named storms, including 10 hurricanes.2016: Two hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 16 named storms, including seven hurricanes.2015: No hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. There were 12 named storms, including four hurricanes.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nursing-professional-degree-excluded-list/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:40:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The department also said in a\u00a0fact sheet that its definition of a professional degree is used to distinguish programs that qualify for higher loan limits from one another, and is \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

      "As the world changed around her, she delighted visitors with her sweet, shy personality. She lived through two world wars, 20 U.S. presidents and two pandemics.",

      "Cristina Park, 69, said one of her earliest memories from her childhood was going to the San Diego Zoo when she was 3 or 4 years old and riding on the back of a tortoise. That's no longer allowed, but the experience inspired her to keep a small desert tortoise as a pet and learn more about tortoise conservation.",

      "The oldest known Galapagos tortoise was named Harriet, who lived at the Australia Zoo until the age of 175. She was collected from the Galapagos Islands in 1835, when she was just the size of a dinner plate, according to the zoo. This means she hatched somewhere around 1830, and she died in 2006.",
      "Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises include 15 subspecies of tortoises from the islands, three of which were deemed extinct. The rest are all vulnerable or critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Concerted efforts have been made to breed these tortoises in captivity over the past several decades, with more than 10,000 juveniles released to the wild since 1965, according to the Gal\u00e1pagos Conservancy. Some subspecies have been brought back from the brink of extinction.",
      "In April, four Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises were born at the Philadelphia Zoo to first-time parents that were roughly 100 years old, a first in the zoo's history. In June, Zoo Miami resident and Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise Goliath became a first-time father at the age of 135.",

    "summary": "An increasing number of farm animal sanctuaries nationwide have started promoting an alternative version of Thanksgiving in which families \"adopt\" turkeys and donate money for their lifelong care.",
    "story": [
      "Erie, Colo. \u2014\u00a0\"Gus\" the turkey has been spending Thanksgiving week much differently than millions of other unlucky gobblers across the U.S.",
      "As he trots in a sprawling animal sanctuary on the Colorado plains, he is stopped every few steps by staff who pet him, hug him or even give him a peck on his red face. Gus has been there since 2023 after being pardoned by the governor.",
      "\"What do you think? Do you want to do snuggles today?\" Lanette Cook, education and engagement manager at the Luvin Arms Animal Sanctuary in Erie, says to Gus.",
      "Gus is among a growing number of turkeys that are being \"adopted\" instead of being covered in gravy and eaten at Thanksgiving dinner tables.",
      "An increasing number of farm animal sanctuaries across the country have started promoting this alternative version of Thanksgiving in which families \"adopt\" turkeys and donate money to their lifelong care. In return, they receive photos, certificates and sometimes even one-on-one visits with the birds.",
      "The goal: Spare a few of the tens of millions of turkeys slaughtered this time of year, many of which are raised in what animal rights advocates say are inhumane conditions in factory farms.",
      "Some people will adopt for themselves and feature their turkey's photo on their Thanksgiving table, while others will gift the adoptions to friends or family members.",
      "At Luvin Arms, a $25 donation comes with a certificate, photo and either a virtual or in-person visit, explained Kelly Nix, its executive director. Since launching the program in 2022, the sanctuary, located about 25 miles north of Denver, has seen the number of sponsorships double every year. And this year they're on track to reach their goal of $18,000, she said.",
      "Luvin Arms' website features Gus and a gaggle of turkeys along with their personality traits (Gus is very talkative!) as part of its sponsor-a-turkey program. It encourages the public to donate for the birds for Thanksgiving and maybe even rethink their holiday traditions.",
      "The funds have helped pay for extending the turkeys' outdoor pasture area, along with feeding and rescuing more turkeys. They've helped with veterinary bills, which can sometimes cost thousands of dollars because of the medical complications that arise for turkeys that come from factory farms, which breed them to grow very big in a short period of time, said Nix. In the wild, turkeys tend to live an average of three or four years, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation.",
      "But the sanctuary says the program is about more than just the turkeys or money. There's also an important educational factor, whether learning about the conditions in factory farms or that turkeys are more than just centerpieces.",
      "\"Even if it makes you stop and double think what it is you're about to do,\" said Nix. \"Or that you're like, 'wow this is a life of a sentient being,' for us, that's a conversation starter.\"",
      "Farm Sanctuary, which is located in New York and California, is believed to be the first to launch this type of turkey adoption program, kicking it off in 1986. Gene Baur, its president and co-founder, said initially the public was not only confused about the program but about the concept of rescuing farm animals altogether.",
      "In the nearly four decades since, the sanctuary has rescued thousands of turkeys. And the public has not only caught on to the concept but in some years has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars, Baur said.",
      "\"We grow up with certain traditions. But just because something is a tradition doesn't mean that it needs to remain as a tradition,\" said Baur.",
      "Barn Sanctuary has had a similar program since 2023 in Chelsea, Michigan. Chase DeBack, its advocacy, education and engagement coordinator, said it's about shining a more positive light on the birds and their distinct personalities.",
      "He rattles off some of the organization's residents like they're close friends: Lewis isn't much of a people person but loves spending times with the girls. Sabrina and Hilda are always interested in what people are bringing into the coop and what everyone's doing.",
      "\"You only hear about kind of the dead turkeys,\" said DeBack. \"And so we really wanted to shine a light on the unique personalities that turkeys have and how loving and caring they are for humans and for each other.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump also considered labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group in his first term.",

      "Aoraki is 12,218 feet high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.",
      "The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.",
      "More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century. Dozens of those who died on the mountain have never been found.",
      "This includes three men, two from the United States and one from Canada, who were believed to have died on Aoraki in December 2024. The Americans - Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California - were certified alpine guides.",
      "The climbers were missing for five days before New Zealand authorities halted a search for them, saying discoveries of their belongings suggested the men had fallen to their deaths.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that Ukraine's government had \"agreed to a peace deal\" brokered by the Trump administration to stop Russia's nearly four-year assault. The American official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Umerov voiced optimism that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could travel to the U.S. before the end of November to finalize an agreement. CBS News was first to report on Sunday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Zelenskyy.",
      "\"The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal,\" the U.S. official told CBS News. \"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.\"",
      "The news came as U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was in Abu Dhabi to meet with Russian officials, two U.S. officials and two diplomatic sources who were not authorized to speak publicly told CBS News. A fifth source with knowledge of the talks also confirmed Driscoll's presence in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Taking to Truth Social\u00a0on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",
      "The president said he directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and that Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainians.",
      "\"I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0wrote on X, \"Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table. There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Russia, the invading force, to what was agreed to in Abu Dhabi, and there were no details from U.S. or Ukrainian officials about what is in the latest proposal. Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which include U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all together at the same time.",
      "Speaking earlier on Tuesday, veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that while Russia \"appreciates the U.S.' position, which is taking the initiative in resolving the Ukrainian conflict,\" Moscow \"operates professionally, not leaking information before formal agreements are reached ... Russia expects the U.S. to inform it of the results of consultations with Ukraine and Europe in the near future.\"",
      "Lavrov stressed that, while Russia was still waiting to receive \"from our American colleagues\" an updated version of the peace proposal, Moscow expected it to include basic tenets agreed between Presidents Trump and Putin during their August meeting in Alaska.",
      "\"Key proposals of Trump's plan are based on understandings reached in Anchorage,\" Lavrov said. He said those principles were \"reflected in the plan\" proposed last week by the White House, \"which we welcomed - President Putin said that.\"",
      "\"We are ready to discuss concrete formulations because there are a whole row of questions that need to be clarified,\" Lavrov said, adding: \"If there will be no spirit and letter of Anchorage on the key understandings that we have fixated, then it will be a different situation in principle.\"",
      "Umerov said Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to the \"core terms\" of a peace proposal amid the ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi, which involve U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials, though not all meeting together at the same time.",
      "Umerov also\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the country's negotiators had \"reached a common understanding on the core terms\" of an agreement discussed among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials in Geneva over the weekend.",
      "\"We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps. We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's President to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,\" Umerov said.",
      "A Trump administration official said there was no agreement for Zelenskyy to come to the U.S. as of late Tuesday morning, but that if a meeting does happen in the coming days, it could take place at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "A U.S. military official in Abu Dhabi told CBS News Driscoll spent hours negotiating Tuesday with Russian representatives, going in and out of meetings all day.",
      "\"We remain very optimistic,\" the official said. \"Secretary Driscoll is optimistic. Hopefully, we'll get feedback from the Russians soon. This is moving quick.\"",
      "It is not clear who else is in the U.S. delegation in Abu Dhabi. A U.S. official told CBS News on Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation was also there and has been in contact with Driscoll and his team.",
      "The apparent progress in Abu Dhabi comes amid an intensified push by President Trump to secure a ceasefire in the almost four-year-long Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "A source with knowledge told CBS News that Driscoll was working in Abu Dhabi off of a revised version of the White House's 28-point proposal, following productive negotiations in Geneva.",
      "Over the weekend, Driscoll, Rubio, Witkoff, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomats from Ukraine and European allies attended talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Driscoll's meeting with Russian officials also follows a visit to Ukraine's capital last week.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials had previously discussed a potential visit to the U.S. this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CBS News reported on Sunday.",
      "Last week, CBS News obtained a draft of one Trump administration-backed proposal to end the war. The proposed plan included several provisions that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past, such as a requirement that Ukraine give up its entire Donetsk region \u2014 including parts that aren't occupied by Russia \u2014 and an end to the country's push to join NATO.",
      "There is also an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.

      "\"We were particularly surprised by how fresh the painting was,\" Perrin told PBS earlier this month. \"In other words, it is a painting that has retained all of its colors perfectly, which has not been recanvassed, retouched or revarnished.\"",
      "Jean Renoir, born in 1894, went on to receive a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1975, several years before he died at the age of 84. His works include the 1930s classic \"La Grande Illusion,\" which follows two French prisoners of war trying to escape German captivity during World War I.",
      "The painting of him as a child had been valued at 1-1.5 million euros and was acquired by an \"international buyer,\" Drouot said on Tuesday.",

      "Her statement didn't say what role they're suspected of having played in the Oct. 19 theft. Police can hold them for questioning for 96 hours.",
      "The loot, valued at around $102 million, hasn't been recovered. It includes a diamond-and-emerald necklace Napoleon gave to Empress Marie-Louise, jewels tied to 19th-century Queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense, and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's pearl-and-diamond tiara.",
      "The thieves dropped a diamond-and-emerald-studded crown that once belonged to Eug\u00e9nie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped.",
      "A police dragnet has previously caught other suspected members of the four-person team thought to have carried out the daring robbery. Investigating magistrates have filed preliminary charges against three men and one woman who were arrested last month.",
      "The heist unfolded when the Louvre, the world's most-visited art museum, was raided in broad daylight. The gang took just seven minutes to steal the jewels before fleeing on scooters.",
      "The thieves parked a moving truck with a ladder below the museum's Apollo Gallery housing the jewels, ascended in a bucket, broke a window and used angle grinders to cut into glass display booths containing the treasures.",
      "One of the men already charged in the heist, a 37-year-old, was in a relationship with the woman and they have children, Beccuau said earlier this month. The couple were arrested after their DNA was found in the basket lift used during the robbery. The man's criminal record contained 11 previous convictions, most of them for theft, she said.",
      "The first two men arrested earlier were also known to the police for having committed thefts. Both lived in the northeastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.",
      "Last week, Louvre director Laurence des Cars revealed some new details about the security breach, saying the power tools used by robbers to cut through the display cases were meant for concrete.",
      "\"It's a method that had not been imagined at all\" when the display cases in the Apollo Gallery were replaced in 2019, she said Wednesday while telling lawmakers that new surveillance cameras and anti-intrusion systems will soon be installed at the Paris landmark. At the time, they had been designed primarily to counter an attack from inside the museum with weapons, she added.",
      "Footage from museum cameras show that during the robbery, the display cases \"held up remarkably well and did not break apart,\" she said. \"Videos show how difficult it was for the thieves.\"",
      "Des Cars stressed security improvement is a priority of the decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan launched earlier this year, with an estimated cost of up to 800 million euros ($933 million), to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "With the Louvre crumbling under the weight of mass tourism, des Cars has restricted the daily number of visitors to 30,000 in recent years.",

      "Pauline Hanson of the anti-immigration One Nation party was accused of racism by fellow lawmakers when she walked into the parliament wearing a burqa on Monday. Hanson called the move \u2014   which she has now done twice in a decade \u2014 a protest against her colleagues' refusal to allow her to introduce a bill that would ban burqas and other face coverings in public.",

      "A new report by wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC warned that criminal networks are evolving faster than conservation efforts can respond. The global wild tiger population, once around 100,000 a century ago, has now plummeted to an estimated 3,700-5,500, it said.",
      "Despite half a century of international protection, TRAFFIC's findings showed that tiger trafficking is accelerating and increasingly targeting whole animals, living or dead. Experts say the shift appears linked to captive-breeding operations, but may also reflect tigers being seized shortly after poaching or before being dismembered for their parts. Additionally, it could be driven by a rise in exotic pet ownership or demand for taxidermy, they say.",
      "The report, the sixth in TRAFFIC's Skin and Bones series examining the illegal trade in tigers, highlights stark trends. Between 2000 and mid-2025, law enforcement agencies globally recorded 2,551 seizures involving at least 3,808 tigers.",
      "In the five years from 2020 to June 2025 alone, authorities made 765 seizures, confiscating the equivalent of 573 tigers, roughly nine a month over 66 months. The worst single year was 2019, when 141 seizures were recorded, followed by 139 in 2023.",
      "Most of the seizures occurred within the 13 countries that have wild tiger populations, led by India with the world's biggest tiger population, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Among countries without tigers, a sizable number of incidents were reported by Mexico, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the report said. While enforcement has strengthened, so has trade.",
      "\"This rise reflects improved enforcement efforts but also signals persistent and, in some areas, escalating criminal activity and a widespread demand for tigers and their parts,\" said Ramacandra Wong, senior wildlife crime analyst and co-author of the report.",
      "TRAFFIC's latest analysis reveals a dramatic shift: In the 2000s, tiger parts accounted for 90% of seized products but since 2020 that proportion has dropped to 60%, replaced by a spike in seizures of whole animal carcasses and live tigers. More than 40% of confiscations in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia now involve whole tigers.",
      "The report identified entrenched hotspots where interventions should be prioritized: India and Bangladesh's tiger reserves; Indonesia's Aceh region; along the Vietnam\u2013Laos border; and Vietnam's major consumption hubs, including its capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report also documents growing \"species convergence\" with almost one in five tiger trafficking incidents involving other threatened wildlife \u2014 most commonly leopards, bears and pangolins.",
      "Patterns of consumption vary sharply by geography. In Mexico and the United States, demand trends toward live tigers, often for exotic pet ownership. Europe shows a stronger market for tiger derivatives used in certain traditional medicines and taxidermy for decoration. Earlier this year, Spanish police arrested two people suspected of selling online exotic cats including protected species such as white tigers and pumas.",
      "Across Asia, demand spans skins, bones, claws and whole dead animals for fashion and traditional medicine.",
      "According to WWF, tiger bones are \"used in traditional medicines or boiled down to make tiger bone glue or steeped in wine, their skins are used as rugs or clothing, their teeth and claws are made into trinkets and amulets, their meat consumed, even their whiskers are highly prized in illegal markets.\"",
      "The report said investigations should not end at the point of seizure. It said strong international cooperation is crucial, and that disruption of organized crime network along the illegal trade chain through intelligence-led, multi-agency enforcement is essential.",
      "Leigh Henry, director of wildlife conservation at the environmental charity WWF, told The Associated Press that the surge in whole-animal trafficking underscored the \"prominent role of captive tiger breeding facilities in feeding and perpetuating the illegal trade.\"",
      "\"Illegal trade remains the greatest immediate threat to wild tigers. If we don't urgently scale up investments to combat tiger trafficking \u2014 at all points along the trade chain \u2014 we absolutely face the possibility of a world without wild tigers,\" she said.",
      "According to WWF, poachers often set up snares in tiger habitats, but \"anything could get caught including tigers, their prey or other wildlife. One thing is for sure whatever is trapped, unless rescued, will die a painful and often slow death.\"",
      "Heather Sohl of the WWF Global Tiger Program called Tuesday's report \"a wake-up call.\"",
      "\"The surge in tiger trafficking and the alarming rise in whole-animal seizures show that criminal networks are adapting faster than our collective response,\" Sohl said in a statement. \"We must urgently scale up investment in tackling illegal trade of tigers from both captive and wild sources across the tiger range countries. Without this, decades of conservation gains risk being undone.\"",

    "summary": "Afghanistan's Taliban government says it will \"respond appropriately\" to Pakistani strikes that killed 10 people near the country's shared border.",
    "story": [
      "Jige Mughalgai, Afghanistan \u2014\u00a0Afghanistan's Taliban government vowed Tuesday to \"respond appropriately\" to overnight border strikes it blamed on Pakistan that killed 10 people, as tension between the neighbors soared following a suicide bombing in Peshawar a day earlier.",
      "\"The Pakistani invading forces bombed the house of a local civilian resident,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a social media post. \"As a result, nine children (five boys and four girls) and one woman were martyred\" in Khost province.",
      "Mujahid said Pakistani airstrikes targeting the border regions of Kunar and Paktika wounded another four civilians.",
      "The raids were carried out by drones and aircraft, according to Mustaghfir Gurbuz, a spokesman for the governor of Khost.",
      "In Jige Mughalgai, near the border with Pakistan, an AFP correspondent saw residents searching through the rubble of a collapsed house and preparing graves for victims.",
      "\"The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns this violation and reiterates that defending its airspace, territory, and people is its legitimate right, and it will respond appropriately at the right time,\" Mujahid said in a separate statement.",
      "The Pakistani military did not comment on the strikes when contacted by AFP, but before the attacks, the country's Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry said in a television interview that the people behind the deadly suicide attack in Peshawar on Monday had come from Afghanistan.",
      "\"These are the same long-range attacks from Afghanistan about which they used to say they will go as far as Islamabad,\" claimed Chaudhry, without offering any specific evidence. \"There are more than 36 terrorist groups in Afghanistan. These terrorists are Indian proxies.\"",
      "The suicide attack targeted the headquarters of Pakistan's paramilitary Federal Constabulary force in Peshawar, killing three officers and wounding 11 others.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility, but Pakistani state broadcaster PTV reported the attackers were Afghan nationals and said President Asif Zardari blamed the \"foreign-backed Fitna al-Khawarij\" \u2014 Islamabad's term for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, or the Pakistani Taliban) militants it accuses of operating from Afghan soil.",
      "Another suicide blast outside a court in the Pakistan capital Islamabad this month killed 12 people and was claimed by a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, which shares the same ideology as the Afghan Taliban but insists it operates independently.",
      "Islamabad blamed a militant cell which was \"guided at every step by the ... high command based in Afghanistan\" for the capital attack.",
      "In a message sent to CBS News' Sami Yousafzai on Tuesday, Amir Mohmand, a TTP commander in a Pakistani region right on the Afghan border, said Pakistan's military strikes on Afghanistan were based on a \"misperception.\"",
      "\"Pakistan is bombing Afghanistan because they think it will stop us ( TTP) from our jihadi struggle against the puppet regime in Islamabad,\" he said. \"The [Afghan] Taliban came to power in 2021. We have been running our struggle since 2006, and even before 1994. The Afghan Taliban may have sympathies on the ground level, but we are independent. No one can define the start or stop of our holy struggle.\"",
      "Mohamand claimed a new wave of suicide bombers had recently completed training and were prepared to carry out additional attacks inside Pakistan.",
      "Pakistan has long accused the Taliban, and India, of covertly backing the TTP's violence, and government Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Tuesday showed a video of an alleged confession by one of the purported suspects in the Peshawar attack, claiming \"clear-cut evidence that TTA [Afghan Taliban] and TTP did it together, and the suicide bomber was a resident of Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"Afghanistan is fully involved ... and their soil is also involved. The people being sheltered there are also involved,\" he said on live television, without mentioning the military's strikes in the neighboring country.",
      "The flare-up of cross-border tension is just the latest challenge to a tenuous ceasefire agreement between the neighbors that came into effect in mid-October, and relations between Islamabad and Kabul have been fraught since the Taliban swept back to power in 2021.",
      "Deadly border clashes in early October killed around 70 people on both sides \u2014 violence that the ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey was intended to halt, but several rounds of talks in Doha and Istanbul failed to produce a lasting agreement, and security issues, especially Pakistan's demand that Kabul go after TTP fighters, have proven to be a sticking point.",
      "Islamabad accuses the Taliban of sheltering militants behind a surge in attacks, including the TTP, which has waged a bloody campaign against Pakistan for years. Kabul denies the charge and counters that Pakistan harbors groups hostile to Afghanistan and does not respect its sovereignty.",

      "Some 50,000 women and girls were killed by intimate partners or family members in 2024, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UN Women said in a report released to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.",
      "The report found that 83,000 women and girls were intentionally killed in 2024. Sixty percent of those women were murdered by partners or relatives such as fathers, uncles, mothers and brothers, the report said.",
      "For comparison, 11% of male murder victims were killed by someone close to them, though about 80% of all homicide victims in 2024 were men, according to the report.",
      "The 50,000 figure \u2014 based on data from 117 countries \u2014 breaks down to 137 women per day, or around one woman every 10 minutes, the report said.",
      "\"The home remains a dangerous and sometimes lethal place for too many women and girls around the world,\" said John Brandolino, acting Executive Director of UNODC, in a news release announcing the report.",
      "The total is slightly lower than the figure reported in 2023, thought it does not indicate an actual decrease, according to the report, as it stems largely from differences in data availability from country to country.",
      "No region of the world went without femicide cases committed by partners or family members. The highest rate was recorded in Africa, with 3 such cases per 100,000 women, followed by the Americas, which saw 1.5 such cases per 100,000 women. Oceania saw 1.4 cases per 100,000 women, Asia had 0.7, and Europe recorded 0.5, according to the report.",

      "The report said technological development has exacerbated some kinds of violence against women and girls and created others, such as non-consensual image-sharing, doxxing, and deepfake videos.",

    "summary": "As U.S. and European officials tout progress in Ukraine peace talks, Zelenskyy says a key sticking point is letting Putin keep \"what he has stolen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that the suggested legal recognition of Russian sovereignty over captured territory in the east of his country remained a \"main problem\" in negotiations as President Trump pushes for a deal to end Moscow's nearly-four-year war on Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian and American officials met over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss a 28-point proposal floated last week by the White House. They discussed the possibility of Zelenskyy visiting the U.S. this week as part of Mr. Trump's bid to get an agreement by Thanksgiving, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported, citing multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the Thanksgiving deadline as flexible, and he told reporters Saturday that the plan presented last week was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Geneva for the weekend talks, said \"very, very meaningful\" progress was made with the Ukrainian and European delegations, but that \"there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Addressing Sweden's parliament on Monday, Zelenskyy made it clear one of the key points of contention over the U.S. proposal was a call for Ukraine and the global community to formally recognize some portion of the ground Russian forces have occupied by force as no longer Ukrainian.",
      "\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That's the main problem. You all understand what that means.\"",
      "Finland's President Alexander Stubb said there were still \"major issues which remain to be resolved\" regarding the U.S. peace proposal, though he also welcomed progress made during the high-stakes talks in Geneva.",
      "Rubio struck a more optimistic tone in describing the weekend talks, saying Sunday that the session in Geneval was \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue\" since President Trump came back into office for his second term in January.",
      "Rubio stressed that there was more work to do and said he didn't want to \"declare victory or finality.\"",
      "The top U.S. diplomat was pressed by reporters but would not offer any insight into which issues were the main sticking points in the peace talks. He called the proposal a \"living, breathing document\" and said he believed the issues that remained unsettled were \"not insurmountable.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following their discussions, but Russia's government said Monday that the revisions had not been shared, and that it would reserve judgement.",
      "Putin said Friday that the U.S. proposal could serve as the basis of a negotiated resolution to what his government has refused to acknowledge as a war, but he warned that if Ukraine turned down the plan, Russian forces would remain on the attack, seizing yet more ground.",
      "\"We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been pouring in from Geneva over the past few days,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, \"but we have not yet received anything official.\"",
      "\"We read a statement that, following the discussions in Geneva, some amendments had been made to the text which we had seen earlier. We will wait. It seems that the dialogue is continuing,\" he said, adding that there were no plans for a meeting this week between Russian and U.S. officials on the topic, but that Moscow remained open to dialogue.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump also considered labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group in his first term.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization, but some say the Venezuelan entity is \"not a group\" at all.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government's designation of the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization officially took effect Monday as part of President Trump's aggressive campaign to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The U.S. identifies Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the group's leader \u2014 and he says the claims of narcoterrorism are actually part of a bid by Mr. Trump to force him from power.",
      "The terrorist designation, which was announced last week, is designed to put more pressure on Maduro, even as U.S. warships and more than 10,000 American troops step up training exercises in the region. The U.S. military has also launched deadly strikes on boats it alleges were carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast \u2014 many of them allegedly run by the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. accuses of ties to the Maduro regime.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, Maduro's government said it \"absolutely rejects the new and ridiculous fabrication\" designating \"the nonexistent Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization, thus repeating an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela, under the classic U.S. format of regime change.\"",
      "Ahead of the designation announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed the group was \"responsible for terrorist violence \u2026 as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "The Cartel de los Soles was also hit in July with U.S. economic sanctions, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said highlighted \"the illegitimate Maduro regime's facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles.\"",
      "What is \u2014 and what isn't \u2014 the Cartel de los Soles?",
      "But what is the so-called Cartel of the Suns? It is not, in the traditional sense, a Latin American drug cartel along the lines of the family-run Sinaloa or the Jalisco New Generation.",
      "The \"suns\" in the name refers to the insignia used for decades to adorn the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.",
      "Venezuelans, including prosecutors and other officials, started using the term colloquially in the 1990s to refer to the cadre of high-ranking military officers who'd grown rich from facilitating drug-running. As corruption expanded across the country, first under the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro as his successor, analysts say the term came to encompass the loosely defined network of police and government officials that facilitated and profited off of activities ranging from illegal mining to fuel and drug trafficking.",
      "The term was first elevated to define an alleged Maduro-led drug trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department, during President Trump's first administration, announced indictments of Venezuela's leader and members of his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges. The Justice Department accused Maduro, through the Cartel de los Soles, of working directly with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine through Venezuela to the U.S.",
      "The designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization has generally been reserved for groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the Trump administration has expanded its use to designate eight Latin American organizations accused of drug trafficking and people smuggling, calling it an effort to counter narcoterrorism.",
      "Some analysts say it's a stretch to even define the Cartel de los Soles as a single unified organization.",
      "\"It is not a group,\" Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank told The Associated Press. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"",
      "\"It is not a hierarchical or ideological group,\" agrees the InSight Crime outlet, which is run by two former journalists who covered Latin America extensively for decades. \"Its structure consists of a diffuse network of cells embedded within Venezuela's main military branches: the army, the navy, the air force, and the national guard, from the lowest to the highest ranks.\"",
      "\"Although the concept is primarily associated with the military sector, other branches of the [Venezuelan] State embedded within the criminal ecosystem have also been identified, including police forces, the executive branch, and various public officials,\" InSight Crime said in an analysis of the purported cartel published in September.",
      "Terrorist designation comes amid U.S. military strikes and build-up",
      "In recent weeks, the U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing dozens of people and sparking a debate in Washington about the legality of the extrajudicial attacks.",
      "The Trump administration has carried out the strikes without providing evidence to support its assertions that the boats are carrying drugs and operated by criminal organizations. It says the attacks, which began in late September off the coast of Venezuela and expanded to the eastern Pacific, are meant to stop narcotics reaching American soil.",
      "But Maduro, and some others, see the U.S. military operations and massive buildup of hardware in the region as an effort to precipitate his ouster \u2014   if not the prelude to an overt operation to topple his government.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said the formal designation of the Cartel de los Soles will give a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" to address Maduro's alleged crimes.",
      "But speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, he declined to give details on what those options included, or to say whether the U.S. military was planning to carry out strikes on targets inside Venezuela.",
      "\"Nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.",
      "Since American troops and hardware \u2014   including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's most advanced aircraft carrier \u2014   started pouring into the Caribbean earlier this year, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition has been more confidently voicing its perennial promise to see Maduro forced from office, fueling speculation over the real endgame of what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation.",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell during an extensive interview for 60 Minutes just weeks ago whether the U.S. operations around Venezuela were about \"getting rid of Maduro,\" President Trump said they were \"about many things,\" but he said the Venezuelan leader's days in office were likely numbered.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

    "story": [
      "A pocket watch that once belonged to one of the Titanic's most renowned passengers has sold at an auction for $2.3 million \u2014 a record price for memorabilia related to the historic shipwreck, according to the auction house.",
      "The 18-carat gold watch was gifted to its original owner, Isidor Straus, by his wife, Ida Straus, for his 43rd birthday, said Henry Aldridge and Son, the auction house that sold it on Saturday. It was recovered from his body after the Titanic sunk in the North Atlantic in April 1912.",
      "Isidor Straus was an American businessman and politician who owned the Macy's department store in New York City. He and his wife were first-class passengers on the Titanic during its maiden voyage from England to New York, and the couple are remembered for their final act of selflessness while on board.",
      "Witnesses who survived the Titanic wreck said afterward that the Strauses were offered two seats on a lifeboat once the ship had struck an iceberg, according to the U.K. government's\u00a0National Archives. But Isidor Straus refused his seat, instead insisting that it should have been offered to younger men, and Ida Straus followed him, reportedly saying, \"Where you go, I go.\"",
      "According to those archives, Isidor and Ida Straus were last seen standing arm in arm on the deck of the Titanic, before a wave crashed overhead and washed them out to sea. The Strauses were the ancestors of Wendy Rush, wife of OceanGate founder Stockton Rush, who died in the infamous Titan submersible explosion in 2023 en route to the Titanic wreck site.",
      "Straus' pocket watch exceeded the previous record sale for a piece of the Titanic's history memorabilia by about $300,000, according to Henry Aldridge and Son. The previous record was set for another gold pocket watch, which sold an auction last year for about $1.97 million. It had been gifted by Titanic survivors to the captain of the RMS Carpathia, who steered his ship toward the Titanic wreck on the night it sunk and ultimately rescued hundreds of passengers still afloat on life boats, according to the auction house.",
      "\"Pocket watches are incredibly personal items,\" said Andrew Aldridge, managing director of the auction house, in a statement. \"Every man, woman and child passenger or crew had a story to tell and they are told 113 years later through the objects that they owned.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jimmy-cliff-reggae-music-icon-dies-age-81/",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 08:51:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Jimmy Cliff, who famously sang about the \"many rivers\" we all must cross, has died after suffering a seizure and pneumonia, his family say.",
    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Peshawar, Pakistan \u2014 Two suicide bombers attacked the headquarters of a security force in northwestern Pakistan on Monday morning, killing at least three officers and wounding 11 others, police and rescue officials said.",
      "The attack took place in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, when security forces were preparing for the morning parade at the sprawling facility located in the heart of the city, said Peshawar Police Chief Saeed Ahmad.",
      "He said one attacker detonated his explosives at the main gate of the provincial headquarters of the Federal Constabulary, while the second bomber was shot and killed by officers near the parking area.",
      "According to Ahmad, about 150 security personnel were on open ground inside the headquarters for morning parade drills when the attack took place. \"The terrorists involved in today's attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "He said police had completed the clearance operation and authorities had collected samples of the body parts of the attackers for DNA tests. He added police are still investigating to determine the identity and nationality of the attackers without giving further details.",
      "Asim Khan, a spokesperson at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital, said all 11 persons wounded in the Peshawar attack were listed in stable condition.",
      "Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, condemned the attack in Peshawar, with Zardari calling it a \"cowardly act by foreign-backed terrorists,\" and Sharif saying the swift response of security forces prevented a larger tragedy. They offered condolences to the families of the victims.",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.",
      "However, the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, have been blamed for similar previous assaults in the country, which has witnessed a surge in militant attacks. The TPP is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban that leads Afghanistan.",
      "The latest attack came less than two weeks after a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, detonating his explosives next to a police car and killing 12 people.",
      "The attacks have strained ties between Islamabad and Afghanistan's Taliban government, with Pakistan accusing the Pakistani Taliban of operating freely inside Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover in 2021.",
      "Pakistan's government often accuses Afghanistan of turning a blind eye to cross-border attacks by militants.",
      "Kabul denies the allegation, but tensions between the two sides escalated after Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for Oct. 9 drone strikes in Kabul and vowed retaliation. The ensuing fighting killed dozens of people, including soldiers, civilians and militants, before Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Oct. 19, which remains in place.",
      "It was followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul, during which the two sides failed to reach an agreement after Afghanistan refused to give guarantees in writing about preventing the TTP from using Afghan soil for attacks inside Pakistan.",
      "Pakistan in recent weeks has stepped up operations against the TTP, killing dozens of insurgents near regions bordering Afghanistan.",

    "summary": "Kim Nok-wan's crimes warrants his \"permanent isolation from society,\" the Seoul Central District Court said.",
    "story": [
      "A 33-year-old South Korean man was sentenced to life in prison Monday for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused 261 victims, including more than a dozen minors he raped or assaulted, over a four-year period before his arrest in January.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said the severity of Kim Nok-wan's crimes warrants his \"permanent isolation from society.\" It sentenced 10 accomplices to prison terms ranging from two to four years in what law enforcement authorities describe as the country's largest cybersex crime case to date.",
      "He was the head of the so-called Vigilantes: a large-scale, pyramid-style group that blackmailed victims into producing explicit content and sharing it in online chatrooms, BBC News reported. Calling himself the \"pastor\" of the group, Kim targeted both male and female victims, according to the BBC News.",
      "Starting around August 2020, Kim targeted women who posted sexually suggestive content on social media, and men attempting to join secret Telegram chat rooms for sharing digitally-manipulated sexual images of acquaintances. He threatened to expose them and coerced them into recruiting new victims, forming a pyramid-like blackmail ring on the app that produced and shared manipulated sexual images of their targets, most of whom were minors, according to details of the crimes revealed in court.",
      "Kim raped or assaulted 16 victims, including 14 minors, and recorded videos of his crimes in 13 of those cases. He created roughly 1,700 sexually exploitative images or videos targeting about 70 victims, disseminating around 260 of them online to threaten those who refused to cooperate, and also attempted to blackmail some of the victims' family members and work colleagues, the court said.",
      "\"[Kim Nok-wan] says in court that he is remorseful, but he committed countless crimes over the past four to five years,\" the court said, per BBC News. \"Considering the brutality of the crimes and the lack of restitution for victims, it is necessary to permanently isolate him from society.\"",
      "The other defendants, including five minors, knew that the victims they recruited through threats involving video and images would face the same sexual exploitation they had endured, but carried out the acts anyway to prevent their own images from being circulated, the court said.",
      "\"Most of the victims were children or adolescents, and it appears they would have suffered extreme physical and psychological pain as a result of the crimes,\" the court said in a statement.",
      "\"Digital sex crimes can rapidly amplify the damages of the victims to an irreparable level in the digital space, and once sexually exploitative materials are distributed, it's physically very difficult to completely remove them, making recovery from damage practically impossible.\"",
      "The revelation of Kim's crimes following his January arrest triggered public shock and concern over the growing risk of sexual violence enabled by digital technologies. Monday's ruling came almost five years after the same court issued a 40-year prison term for Cho Ju-bin on charges of blackmailing dozens of women, including minors, into filming sexually explicit videos and selling them to others.",

    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Ukraine said on Nov. 25 that it has agreed to \"the core terms\" of a peace deal\u00a0brokered by the U.S., amid ongoing talks in Abu Dhabi to work out remaining details. None of the changes to the Trump administration's original 28-point proposal\u00a0have been released. Read the latest here; our earlier story on the initial proposal is below.",
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it, according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-alleged-hybrid-warfare-undersea-cables/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A web of undersea cables connects our lives and our global economy. As U.S. adversaries are accused of sabotage, they're proving to be targets of choice.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.",
      "They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.",
      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",
      "Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure \u2014 including undersea cables \u2014 that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.",
      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",
      "Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe \"Russophobia.\"",
      "What is happening in the Baltic Sea?",
      "The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.",
      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",

      "Published in JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed nearly 1,000 lung cancer patients who were treated at Northwestern Medicine between 2018 and 2023.",

      "STEALTH BREAST CANCER THAT HIDES FROM SCANS TARGETED IN BREAKTHROUGH TECH",
      "USPSTF currently recommends annual CT scans for adults ages 50 to 80 who have a 20 pack-year smoking history (the equivalent of one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years) and either still smoke or quit within the last 15 years.",

      "That means roughly two-thirds of patients would not have been flagged for testing before their diagnosis.",
      "\"Not only does that approach miss many patients who had quit smoking in the past or did not quite meet the high-risk criteria, it also misses other patients at risk of lung cancer, such as non-smokers,\" Luis Herrera, M.D., a thoracic surgeon at Orlando Health, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"The current participation in lung cancer screening for patients who do qualify based on smoking history is quite low,\" said Herrera, who was not involved in the study. This is likely due to the complexity of the risk-based criteria and stigma associated with smoking and lung cancer, he added.",

      "The far-left push within the Democratic Party, highlighted by mayoral victories by socialist candidates in New York City and Seattle, is poised to be a major factor in several key battleground House races as several candidates carrying the progressive mantle hold strong positions in Democratic primaries.",
      "Several of the most competitive House races in the country feature candidates putting to the test whether progressive policies can appeal to voters outside deep blue urban centers, including in California\u2019s 22nd Congressional District, where Democrat Randy Villegas is running to unseat Republican Rep. David Valadao.",
      "\"Bernie and I share the same goal: to make life more affordable for working families,\" Villegas said in a statement after being endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described \"democratic socialist.\"",
      "\"He has dedicated his life to putting power in the hands of ordinary Americans instead of the ultra-rich, and I\u2019m excited to work together to fight for our communities here in the Central Valley and across the country.\"",
      "In addition to being endorsed by Sanders, who endorsed New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Villegas has employed the Fight Agency advertising firm, among others, which is led by operatives who also helped Mamdani cruise to victory earlier this month.",

      "\"Here in the Central Valley, we couldn't care less about political labels,\" Villegas said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"We care about being able to see a doctor without going bankrupt and being able to feed our families without needing a second job. We're sick of politicians in both parties selling us out to billionaires and corporations. Any politician who isn't fighting for working families like our lives depends on it needs to get out of the way.\"",
      "In Colorado\u2019s 8th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Gabe Evans is being challenged by another progressive Democrat, Manny Rutinel, in what is expected to be one of the tightest House races next November.",
      "Rutinel, who serves as a Colorado state representative,\u00a0who was reportedly spotted alongside Mamdani and holds a large fundraising lead over his Democrat opponents, has associated himself with a variety of far-left groups and politicians, including Rep. Ilhan Omar,\u00a0D-Minn., Townhall reported.",

      "While Washington pushes proposals aimed at easing Russia\u2019s terms for a cease-fire with Ukraine in Europe, it\u2019s taking a far tougher stance in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 moving to label Venezuela\u2019s military-linked Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization and quietly expanding its military footprint in the Caribbean.",
      "Sporadic strikes on alleged cartel boats off Venezuela\u2019s coast have grown into the largest U.S. military presence in Southern Command\u2019s area in a generation, with the world\u2019s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, steaming toward the Caribbean Sea. President Donald Trump has reportedly approved CIA covert measures inside Venezuela \u2014 operations that often precede military force \u2014 and U.S. planners have already drawn up target lists for cartel sites, according to The New York Times.",

      "At the same time, a top Russian commander, Colonel General Oleg Makarevich, has been reassigned from the Ukrainian front to head Russia\u2019s Equator Task Force in Venezuela, overseeing roughly 120 troops training Venezuelan forces, Ukrainian intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told The War Zone. Fox News Digital has not independently verified Budanov\u2019s claim.",
      "Seth Krummrich, a retired U.S. Army colonel and vice president at Global Guardian, said Russian military advisers are indeed operating inside Venezuela but doubted Moscow would back Maduro militarily. \"They\u2019re there, full stop,\" Krummrich said. \"But Russia needs to stop the massive blood-letting of its young men in Ukraine. They\u2019re not going to go toe-to-toe with us militarily.\" He added that the relationship is long-standing: \"There is a long history of Russian military advisers in Cuba and in Venezuela that goes on for decades.\"",
      "Many in Washington see a strategic payoff in forcing out Maduro: it would strip Russia of its last firm foothold in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 a loss comparable, in some analysts\u2019 view, to Moscow\u2019s waning influence in Syria. \"Venezuela, for the longest time, has been a launch pad for Chinese, Russian, and Iranian influence in the Western Hemisphere,\" Krummrich said. \"These chess pieces are all tied together when you arch your great-power competition.\"",
      "Other experts caution against assuming the U.S. escalation in Venezuela and its peace overtures in Europe are part of a single coordinated plan. Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), spoke with Fox News Digital and said any overlap may be more coincidence than strategy.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been zigging and zagging in Venezuela,\" Berg said. \"Trump has gone back and forth between build-ups and calls for dialogue, while the Russia timeline has only recently become parallel to these events. Anything that looks coordinated is likely coincidence.\"",
      "Berg recalled that during Trump\u2019s first administration, some advisers floated an \"Ukraine-for-Venezuela\" concept \u2014 asking Russia to relinquish its stake in Caracas in exchange for U.S. concessions in Eastern Europe \u2014 but the idea was quickly abandoned. \"Russian power in Venezuela is important,\" Berg said, \"but it\u2019s not so overwhelming that it\u2019s the reason Maduro survives.\"",
      "HOW TRUMP\u2019S STRIKES AGAINST ALLEGED NARCO-TERRORISTS ARE RESHAPING THE CARTEL BATTLEFIELD: 'ONE-WAY TICKET'",
      "Russia\u2019s footprint in Latin America has grown only modestly since the early 2000s, dwarfed by China\u2019s economic expansion. Moscow\u2019s closest partners remain Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Beyond them, its influence is exercised mainly through media and selective economic pressure.",
      "\"If you look at Russia\u2019s trade profile with the region, it\u2019s small,\" Berg said. \"But Moscow is very good at using those few trade points for leverage.\"",
      "Russia continues to service aging equipment across the region. \"They sell a lot of kit here,\" Berg added. \"Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. That creates dependency.\" (Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)",
      "He cited examples: when Ecuador considered sending old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for U.S. military aid, Russia threatened to block Ecuadorian banana exports \u2014 nearly $1 billion annually \u2014 by imposing new phytosanitary checks. The deal collapsed within a week.",
      "Similarly, Moscow has kept Brazil and Argentina largely muted on the Ukraine invasion by leveraging its control over nitrate fertilizer exports, crucial to both agricultural giants. \"They use whatever levers they have \u2014 bananas, fertilizer, spare parts \u2014 to coerce quietly,\" Berg said.",
      "Russia also continues to service aging equipment across the region. \"They sell a lot of kit here,\" Berg added. \"Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. That creates dependency.\"",
      "If U.S. forces strike Venezuelan targets, most observers expect Russia to limit its response to intelligence sharing and disinformation, not combat support. \"The Russians are pretty tied down in Ukraine,\" Berg said. \"We saw during the 12-day war, when Iran appealed for help, Moscow stayed silent. They simply don\u2019t have the capacity.\"",
      "Berg described a recent episode in which a sanctioned Ilyushin cargo plane landed in Caracas. Russian lawmakers briefly claimed it carried air-defense systems and technicians to assist Maduro, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later denied it. \"He essentially said, \u2018We have no mutual-defense treaty,\u2019\" Berg noted. \"That was widely read as: we\u2019re not coming to Venezuela.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has reportedly approved CIA covert measures inside Venezuela \u2014 operations that often precede military force \u2014 and U.S. planners have already drawn up target lists for cartel sites, according to the New York Times. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder)",
      "John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, also spoke with Fox News Digital and said there is little evidence of a coordinated link between the U.S. buildup in the Caribbean and Washington\u2019s peace overtures in Europe. \"I don\u2019t see any immediate connection,\" Hardie said. \"Russia\u2019s ability to influence events in Venezuela is pretty limited.\"",
      "He said Moscow\u2019s power-projection capacity in the Western Hemisphere remains constrained. \"They can take limited action \u2014 fly some bombers into the region, sail submarines to Cuba \u2014 but major operations in Latin America are beyond their capacity,\" Hardie said.",
      "Hardie also noted reports of the Russian Ilyushin transport aircraft visiting Venezuela and suggestions it could have carried air-defense systems, but said any such transfer would have little strategic effect. \"Even if Russia slipped in some air defenses, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference,\" he said. \"The Venezuelan military would still be heavily overmatched by the United States.\"",
      "Both Krummrich and Berg agree that momentum is building toward U.S. kinetic action. Berg said indications point to possible strikes between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as U.S. naval and intelligence assets align and Trump signals impatience with Maduro\u2019s attempts to stall.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"Maduro\u2019s instinct is to buy time \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s kept him afloat through multiple administrations,\" Berg said. \"But Trump wants results, not a two-year transition or vague promises about U.S. oil access. The question is what Maduro can offer that will actually satisfy him.\"",
      "Whether this two-track moment represents coincidence or coordination, the stakes are high. A peace framework in Europe could stabilize one front while a new flashpoint ignites closer to home \u2014 underscoring the paradox of Washington\u2019s posture in late 2025: seeking de-escalation abroad while bracing for confrontation in its own hemisphere."

      "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump-aligned lawfare group founded by White House aide Stephen Miller is petitioning two of the government's top federal health agencies to immediately repeal a Biden-era regulation they claim promotes organ transplantation allocation based on race, not medical need.",
      "Initially, the proposed rule from the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had an equity performance adjustment, but that part of the rule was scrapped before it was finalized.",
      "The Increasing Organ Transplant Access (IOTA) Model in question scores selected hospitals, which are required to participate, across three domains as it relates to kidney organ transplantation: achievement, efficiency and quality. Based on the scores, hospitals will either get money for their efforts, owe money back to the federal government for not meeting expectations, or neither receive nor owe anything.",
      "Rather than an explicit score adjustment, the rule's equity agenda was embedded more subtly through a \"voluntary\" health equity plan that mandatory participating hospitals are encouraged to complete. The plan pushes hospitals to identify \"health disparities\" and identify \"equity goals to monitor and evaluate progress in reducing targeted health disparities,\" which will be measured by \"one or more quantitative metrics that the IOTA participant uses to measure the reductions in target health disparities arising from the health equity plan interventions.\"",

      "The six-year mandatory payment program builds on earlier payment experiments, testing whether financial rewards and penalties can improve care and expand access for Medicare and Medicaid patients. The rule was published in the Federal Register on Dec. 4, and began operating on July 1,",
      "Meanwhile, according to AFL, 67 of the 103 hospitals mandated to participate in the IOTA Model are \"still engaging\" in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The conservative lawfare group argues this is normalizing \"identity-based preferences\"\u00a0within the nation's organ transplant system.",
      "RUBIO ORDERS RESTITUTION FOR HUNDREDS OF STAFFERS DENIED PROMOTIONS UNDER BIDEN DEI RULE",
      "\"The IOTA Model is a leftover remnant of an\u00a0unlawful equity agenda that encouraged hospitals to view lifesaving care through a DEI lens,\" said AFL attorney Megan Redshaw. \"Federal law requires that organ allocation be based on established medical criteria, not race or identity, and no rule should push hospitals to pursue transplant volume while layering race-based pressures onto a system already\u00a0plagued by ethical failures.\"",

The order also required federal agencies to develop an action plan to address those barriers.",
      "As part of this effort, in December 2021, CMS issued a request to the public for comments on how the agency could \"Advance Equity and Reduce Disparities in Organ Transplantation.\"",
      "\"CMS is focused on identifying potential system-wide improvements that would increase organ donations, improve transplants, enhance the quality of care in dialysis facilities, increase access to dialysis services, and advance equity in organ donation and transplantation,\" the agency said at the time. \"Black Americans are almost four times more likely, and Latinos are 1.3 times more likely, to have kidney failure compared to White Americans. Despite the higher risk, data shows that Black and Latino patients on dialysis are less likely to be placed on the transplant waitlist and have a lower likelihood of transplantation. Because of these stark inequities, CMS\u2019 [Request For Information] asks the public for specific ideas on advancing equity within the organ transplantation system.\"",

In July, HHS released a statement announcing an initiative to reform the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), following a federal investigation that found \"disturbing practices by a major organ procurement organization.\"",
      "AFL argues that the IOTA Model final rule, specifically, violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the equal protection clause, precedent established by the U.S. Supreme Court, and executive orders issued by President Donald Trump.",
      "The lawfare group added that the rule also exceeds CMS' statutory authority under the Social Security Act, and is \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "\"The Biden Administration built this kidney transplant policy on the false premise that fairness requires discrimination,\" Redshaw said. \"This rule treats race as a substitute for medical judgment, and it risks condemning patients to die on waitlists based on immutable traits instead of clinical need.

Users who prefer to stop providing these logs can simply disconnect their device from Wi-Fi via the on-device settings menu.\"",
      "The thermostats continue reporting temperature, motion and light data even though official support has ended.",
      "Why this discovery matters",
      "Google cut access to remote control, security updates, software updates and status checks through the Nest and Google Home apps. Owners can no longer rely on the devices for key smart features. Yet the thermostats still push data to Google, creating a one-way connection that helps the company more than the customer.",
      "Users do not benefit from the logs because support has been discontinued. Google cannot use these logs to diagnose problems or offer help. That raises questions about transparency and user choice for people who assumed the connection ended.",
      "The FULU bounty that sparked the discovery",
      "FULU's bounty program encouraged developers to build tools that restore functionality to devices abandoned by their makers. After reviewing submissions, FULU awarded Kociemba and another developer known as Team Dinosaur the top bounty of $14,772 for bringing smart features back to early Nest models.",
      "Their work highlights how community-driven repair efforts can keep useful devices alive. It also reveals how companies handle device data long after official support stops.",
      "Ways to stay safe if you still use an old Nest thermostat",
      "If you keep one of these unsupported Nest thermostats on your network, you can take a few simple steps to protect your privacy. These tips help reduce what the device sends to Google and lower your exposure.",
      "Start by checking what Google has linked to your home devices. Visit myactivity.google.com and look for thermostat logs or events you do not expect.",
      "A guest network keeps the thermostat away from your main devices. This limits what the thermostat can reach and helps prevent broader access.",
      "Some routers let you stop individual devices from sending data to the internet. This cuts off log uploads while still letting the thermostat control heating and cooling.",
      "If the device menu still offers cloud settings, turn off anything related to remote access or online diagnostics. Even partial controls help reduce data flow.",
      "Check your connected devices in your Google settings. Remove any old Nest entries that no longer serve a purpose. This stops leftover links that may still send data.",
      "Some routers send analytics back to the router maker. Turn off cloud diagnostics to reduce the footprint of unsupported smart products.",
      "Unsupported devices lose security updates. If you cannot isolate the thermostat on your network, consider upgrading to a model that still receives patches.",
      "Pro Tip: Reduce your footprint with a data removal service",
      "A data removal service can help you cut down on the amount of personal information available to data brokers. This adds another layer of privacy that supports your smart home security.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Smartphone banking has made life easier, but it has also opened new opportunities for cybercriminals.",
      "Over the past few years, we have seen Android malware steal passwords, intercept OTPs and even take remote control of phones to drain accounts. Some scams focus on fake banking apps, while others rely on phishing messages that trick you into entering sensitive details.",
      "Security researchers have now discovered a new threat that goes a step further. Instead of simply stealing login information, this malware gives thieves the ability to walk up to an ATM and withdraw your money in real time.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Android malware like NGate tricks users into downloading fake banking apps that steal sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the NGate malware works",
      "The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) discovered a new Android malware called NGate that uses NFC activity to access a victim's bank account. This malware monitors contactless payment actions on the victim's phone and forwards all transaction data, including the PIN, directly to a server controlled by attackers. It does not just copy card details. Instead, it waits until the victim taps to pay or performs a verification step, then captures the fresh, one-time authentication codes that modern Visa and Mastercard chips generate.",
      "To pull this off, attackers need to infect the phone first. They typically send phishing messages claiming there is a security problem with the victim's bank account. These messages often push people to download a fake banking app from a non-official source. Once the victim installs it, the app walks them through fake verification prompts and requests permissions that allow it to read NFC activity. As soon as the victim taps their phone or enters their PIN, the malware captures everything the ATM needs to validate a withdrawal.",
      "MANAGE ANDROID APPS WITH THE NEW 'UNINSTALL' BUTTON",
      "Once installed, the malware captures NFC tap-to-pay codes and PINs the moment the victim uses their phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What attackers do with the stolen data at the ATM",
      "The attackers rely on speed. The one-time codes generated during an NFC transaction are valid for only a short period. As soon as the infected phone captures the data, the information is uploaded to the attacker's server. An accomplice waits near an ATM, holding a device capable of emulating a contactless card. This could be another phone, a smartwatch or custom NFC hardware.",
      "When the data arrives, the accomplice presents the card-emulating device at the ATM. Since the information contains fresh, valid authentication codes and the correct PIN, the machine treats it like a real card. The ATM authorizes the withdrawal because everything appears to match a legitimate transaction. All of this happens without the criminal ever touching the victim's physical card. Everything depends on timing, planning and getting the victim to unknowingly complete the transaction on their own phone.",
      "Criminals use the stolen, time-limited codes at an ATM to make real withdrawals without the victim\u2019s card. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from Android NGate malware",
      "As attacks like NGate become more sophisticated, staying safe comes down to a mix of good digital habits and a few simple tools that protect your phone and your financial data.",
      "Most malicious banking apps spread through direct links sent in texts or emails. These links lead to APK files hosted on random servers. When you install apps only from the Play Store, you get Google's built-in security checks. Play Protect regularly scans apps for malware and removes harmful ones from your device. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. Even if attackers send convincing messages, avoid installing anything from outside the official store. If your bank wants you to update an app, you will always find it on the Play Store.",
      "One careless tap on a fake bank alert can hand criminals everything they need. Strong antivirus software can stop most threats before they cause damage. It scans new downloads, blocks unsafe links and alerts you when an app behaves in ways that could expose your financial data. Many threats like NGate rely on fake banking apps, so having real-time scanning turned on gives you an early warning if something suspicious tries to install itself.",

      "Security patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers use to hijack permission settings or read sensitive data. Updates also improve how Android monitors NFC and payment activity. Turn on automatic updates for both the operating system and apps, especially banking and payment apps. A fully updated device closes many of the holes that malware tries to exploit.",
      "Phishing attacks often direct you to fake websites or fake app login pages that look identical to the real thing. A password manager saves your credentials and fills them in only when the website or app is authentic. If it refuses to autofill, it is a clear sign that you are on a fake page. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication gives you a second layer of protection, even if your password is compromised. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes because they cannot be intercepted as easily. For banking apps, enabling 2FA adds friction for attackers trying to perform unauthorized actions. Combined with strong passwords from a password manager, it significantly reduces the chance of account takeover.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency to trick you. They often claim that your card is blocked, your account is frozen or a payment needs verification. These messages push you to act fast and install a fake app. Always pause and check your bank's official channels. Contact the bank through verified customer care numbers or the official app. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, even if they look legitimate.",
      "Most people install apps and forget about them. Over time, unused apps pile up with unnecessary permissions that increase risk. Open your phone's permission settings and check what each app can access. If a simple tool asks for access to NFC, messages or accessibility features, uninstall it. Attackers exploit these excessive permissions to monitor your activity or capture data without your knowledge.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals are now combining social engineering with the secure hardware features inside modern payment systems. The malware does not break NFC security. Instead, it tricks you into performing a real transaction and steals the one-time codes at that moment. This makes the attack difficult to spot and even harder to reverse once the withdrawal goes through. The best defense is simple awareness. If a bank ever urges you to download an app from outside the Play Store, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Keeping your phone clean is now as important as keeping your physical card safe.",

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Google is sounding the alarm for Android users after uncovering a wave of fake VPN apps that sneak malware onto phones and tablets. These dangerous apps pose as privacy tools but hide info stealers, banking trojans and remote access malware designed to loot personal data.",
      "More people are relying on VPNs to protect their privacy, secure home networks and shield personal information while using public Wi-Fi. Attackers know this demand is growing. They use it to lure users into downloading convincing VPN lookalikes that contain hidden malware.",

      "Fake VPN apps are spreading across Android devices by posing as trusted privacy tools. (iStock)",
      "How fake VPN apps lure users",
      "Cybercriminals create malicious VPN apps that impersonate trusted brands. They use sexually suggestive ads, geopolitical headlines or fake privacy claims to push people into quick downloads. Google says many of these campaigns run across app stores and shady websites.",
      "DELETE THE FAKE VPN APP STEALING ANDROID USERS' MONEY",
      "Once installed, these apps inject malware that steals passwords, messages and financial details. Attackers can hijack accounts, drain bank balances or lock devices with ransomware. Some campaigns even use professional ad creatives and influencer-style promotions to appear legitimate.",
      "Scammers now use AI tools to design ads, phishing pages and fake brands with alarming speed. This gives them the power to reach large groups of victims with very little effort.",
      "Why malicious VPN apps are spreading",
      "Fake VPN apps remain one of the most effective tools for attackers. These apps request sensitive permissions and often run silently in the background. Once active, they can collect browsing data, cryptocurrency wallet details or private messages.",
      "According to Google, the most dangerous apps pretend to be known enterprise VPNs or premium privacy tools. Many promote themselves through adult ads, push notifications and cloned social media accounts.",
      "How to recognize a genuine VPN app",
      "Google recommends installing VPN services only from trusted sources. In Google Play, legitimate VPNs include a verified VPN badge to show that the app passed an authenticity check.",
      "A real VPN will never ask for access to your contacts, photos or private messages. It will not ask you to sideload updates or follow outside links for installation.",
      "Be careful with free VPN claims. Many free privacy tools rely on excessive data collection or hide malware inside downloadable files.",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake VPN apps",
      "Staying ahead of these fake VPN scams starts with a few smart habits that make your device much harder for attackers to target.",
      "Stick to the Google Play Store. Avoid links from ads, pop-ups or messages that try to rush you. Many fake VPN campaigns depend on off-platform downloads because they cannot pass the Play Store security checks.",
      "Google now includes a special VPN badge that verifies an app has passed an authenticity review. This badge confirms that the developer followed strict guidelines and that the app went through additional screening.",
      "If you want a reliable VPN that has already been vetted for security and performance, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Malicious VPN apps often target information already floating around the web, including your email, phone number and personal details exposed through data brokers. A trusted data removal service can help pull your information from people-search sites and broker databases, which reduces the amount of data scammers can use against you. This limits the damage if a fake VPN app steals your info or if attackers try to match stolen data with public records to build convincing scams.",
      "CAN YOU BE TRACKED WHEN USING A VPN?",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all emerging malware from Android devices.",
      "Settings may vary depending on your Android phone\u2019s manufacturer",
      "How to turn it on: Open Google Play Store \u2192 Tap your profile icon \u2192 Select Play Protect \u2192 Tap Settings \u2192 Turn on Scan apps with Play Protect \u2192 Turn on Improve harmful app detection.",
      "While Google Play Protect offers a helpful first layer of defense, it is not a full antivirus. A strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection. It can block malicious downloads, detect hidden malware and warn you when an app acts in unusual ways. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "A genuine VPN only needs network-related permissions. If a VPN asks for access to photos, contacts or messages, treat it as a major warning sign. Restrict permissions when possible.",
      "Sideloaded apps bypass Google's security filters. Attackers often hide malware inside APK files or update prompts that promise extra features. If you're unfamiliar with the term, sideloading means installing apps outside the Google Play Store, usually by downloading a file from a website, email or message. These apps never go through Google's safety checks, which makes them far riskier to install.",
      "Fake VPN ads often claim your device is already infected or that your connection is not secure. Real privacy apps do not use panic-based marketing.",
      "Look up the developer's website and reviews. A legitimate VPN provider will have a clear privacy policy, customer support and a consistent history of app updates.",
      "Free VPNs often rely on risky data practices or hide malware. If a service promises premium features at no cost, question how it pays its bills.",
      "DO YOU NEED A VPN AT HOME? HERE ARE 10 REASONS YOU DO",
      "If someone contacts you claiming they can recover stolen money, cut contact. Real agencies never demand upfront fees and never request remote access to your device.",
      "Install security patches as soon as they appear. Updates protect your phone from malware strains that rely on old software vulnerabilities.",
      "Scammers now use AI-generated ads and fake brands to trick you into quick downloads. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake VPN apps are becoming a major threat to Android users as scammers exploit the rising demand for privacy tools and home network security. Attackers hide behind familiar logos, aggressive ads and AI-powered campaigns to push apps that steal data the moment you install them. Staying safe requires careful downloading habits, attention to permissions and a healthy amount of skepticism toward anything that claims instant privacy or premium features for free.",

      "Archer Aviation, a leading developer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, just made one of its boldest moves yet. The company agreed to acquire Hawthorne Airport for $126 million in cash.",
      "According to Archer's latest shareholder letter, the deal includes the remaining 30 years on the airport's master lease and an exclusive option to take a controlling stake in the on-site fixed-base operator, subject to city approval.",
      "This historic 80-acre site includes about 190,000 square feet of terminals, office space and hangars. Its location near LAX and major Los Angeles destinations makes it a prime spot for an air taxi network that aims to change how people move in crowded cities.",

      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "A rendering of Archer\u2019s development plans for Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Why Hawthorne Airport matters for the new air taxi network",
      "Archer Aviation plans to use the airport as the main operational hub for its LA air taxi network. The company also plans to prepare the site to support transportation during the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This includes managing everything from takeoff scheduling to ground operations. In its shareholder letter, Archer frames Hawthorne as a \"plug-and-play\" anchor hub for its LA28 Olympic plans, saying it expects to ramp up aircraft testing, storage, maintenance and charging on-site as it prepares for commercial service.",
      "The airport will also become a test bed for next-generation AI-powered aviation systems. These tools will help Archer develop smarter air traffic management, faster turnaround times and safer operations in crowded airspace.",
      "Archer outlines a two-phase plan in the letter. Phase 1 focuses on redeveloping up to 200,000 square feet of hangars and locking in control of the FBO, while Phase 2 layers in AI air traffic and ground management, smart sensor-embedded runways and a more digital, streamlined passenger experience.",
      "United Airlines CFO Michael Leskinen praised the move and said,\u00a0\"Archer's trajectory validates our conviction that eVTOLs are part of the next generation of air traffic technology that will fundamentally reshape aviation. Their vision for an AI-enabled operations platform isn't just about eVTOLs, it's also about leveraging cutting-edge technology to better enable moving people safely and efficiently in our most congested airspaces. Through United's investment arm, United Airlines Ventures, we're investing in companies like Archer that pioneer technologies that will define and support aviation infrastructure for decades to come.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Hawthorne Mayor Alex Vargas celebrated the deal on social media, writing\u00a0\"WELCOME ARCHER TO THE CITY OF HAWTHORNE!\"",
      "Archer plans to turn Hawthorne Airport into the main hub for its LA air taxi network. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Neighbors outraged over \u2018AI air taxi\u2019 takeover",
      "Not everyone is cheering Archer's plan to turn Hawthorne into a flagship hub for AI-guided flying taxis. A local group called Hawthorne Quiet Skies, made up of residents living around the airport, says it was blindsided by the $126 million takeover and that no one from the company or city bothered to engage it before announcing a \"test bed for AI-powered aviation technologies\" over homes.",
      "Neighbors who live just across the street and within a couple of blocks of the runway describe Hawthorne as one of the most tightly packed airports in the country, with homes on three sides and years of complaints about deafening jet and helicopter noise. The city's own 2021 noise study identified more than 160 homes and roughly 480 people already exposed to unhealthy noise levels, yet residents say there has been \"zero progress\" on mitigation even as the airport shifted from small private planes to commercial traffic and now an around-the-clock eVTOL hub.",
      "The group is also raising alarms about Archer's AI ambitions, pointing to academic research that current machine-learning systems in aviation still struggle to handle unusual conditions and lack formal safety guarantees.",
      "They argue that whatever the promises of cleaner, futuristic air taxis, Hawthorne is being used as a live test site without clear safeguards, updated federal noise rules or any serious plan to compensate families if nonstop eVTOL traffic makes their homes too loud to live in.",
      "CHINA\u2019S FIRST MASS-PRODUCED FLYING CAR DEBUTS",
      "How Archer Aviation is funding growth and expanding its air taxi program",
      "Alongside the airport news, Archer reported major financial momentum. The company raised an additional $650 million in equity, which boosted its total liquidity to more than $2 billion. The company's Midnight aircraft also hit new flight milestones, including a 55-mile flight at over 126 mph and a climb to 10,000 feet.",
      "Archer also expanded its global technology footprint. It completed the acquisition of Lilium's patent portfolio, which pushes Archer's total intellectual property to more than 1,000 global assets. Those patents cover ducted fans, high voltage systems, flight controls and other key technologies.",
      "International expansion is underway, too. Archer began test and demo flights in the UAE and secured new partnerships with Korean Air and with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo's JV in Osaka and Tokyo.",
      "The airport will serve as a test bed for next-generation AI aviation systems designed to manage busy airspace more safely. (Archer Aviation)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Archer's airport deal suggests that air taxis are moving closer to everyday use. This shift could mean shorter trips across major cities at a fraction of today's travel time. It could also bring quieter aircraft over neighborhoods compared to helicopters.",
      "For Los Angeles residents, Hawthorne Airport may become a central point for fast point-to-point travel once certification moves forward. Visitors flying in for major events like the LA28 Olympics could see air taxis as a smooth alternative to gridlocked freeways.",
      "Businesses may gain new options for rapid transport across the region. The move also signals more investment and jobs in advanced aviation, automation and clean electric travel.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Archer's acquisition of Hawthorne Airport marks a major milestone in the race to build a real air taxi network, giving the company the aircraft, funding and prime location it needs to push the industry forward. Its focus on AI-driven operations shows how automated aviation may soon play a much bigger role in daily life, even as regulators are still working out how to safely integrate these aircraft into crowded cities. At the same time, the move is already sparking backlash from neighbors who worry about more noise and safety risks and being turned into a test site for AI-guided aircraft without a real say. If Archer can win over regulators, investors and the communities living just beyond the fence line, this step could make the future of urban flight feel much closer, for better or worse.",

      "\u2018The CyberGuy\u2019 Kurt Knutsson joins \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend\u2019 to discuss the potential effects of artificial intelligence software like ChatGPT on the brain.",
      "App stores are supposed to be reliable and free of malware or fake apps, but that's far from the truth. For every legitimate application that solves a real problem, there are dozens of knockoffs waiting to exploit brand recognition and user trust. We've seen it happen with games, productivity tools and entertainment apps. Now, artificial intelligence has become the latest battleground for digital impostors.",
      "The AI boom has created an unprecedented gold rush in mobile app development, and opportunistic actors are cashing in. AI-related mobile apps collectively account for billions of downloads, and that massive user base has attracted a new wave of clones. They pose as popular apps like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E, but in reality, they conceal sophisticated spyware capable of stealing data and monitoring users.",

      "Fake AI apps pose as trusted tools like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E while secretly stealing user data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the fake AI apps",
      "The fake apps flooding app stores exist on a spectrum of harm, and understanding that range is crucial before you download any AI tools. Take the \"DALL\u00b7E 3 AI Image Generator\" found on Aptoide. It presents itself as an OpenAI product, complete with branding that mimics the real thing. When you open it, you see a loading screen that looks like an AI model generating an image. But nothing is actually being generated.",
      "Network analysis by Appknox showed the app connects only to advertising and analytics services. There's no AI functionality, just an illusion designed to collect your data for monetization.",
      "Then there are apps like WhatsApp Plus, which are far more dangerous. Disguised as an upgraded version of Meta's messenger, this app hides a complete malware framework capable of surveillance, credential theft and persistent background execution. It's signed with a fake certificate instead of WhatsApp's legitimate key and uses a tool often used by malware authors to encrypt malicious code.",
      "Once installed, it silently requests extensive permissions, including access to your contacts, SMS, call logs, device accounts and messages. These permissions allow it to intercept one-time passwords, scrape your address book and impersonate you in chats. Hidden libraries keep the code running even after you close the app. Network logs show it uses domain fronting to disguise its traffic behind Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud endpoints.",
      "Not every clone is malicious. Some apps identify themselves as unofficial interfaces and connect directly to real APIs. The problem is that you often can't tell the difference between a harmless wrapper and a malicious impersonator until it's too late.",
      "Clones hide spyware that can access messages, passwords and contacts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Users and businesses are equally at risk",
      "The impact of fake AI apps goes far beyond frustrated users. For enterprises, these clones pose a direct threat to brand reputation, compliance and data security.",
      "When a malicious app steals credentials while using your brand's identity, customers don't just lose data but also lose trust. Research shows customers stop buying from a brand after a major breach. The average cost of a data breach now stands at 4.45 million dollars, according to IBM's 2025 report. In regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, such breaches can lead to violations of GDPR, HIPAA and PCI-DSS, with fines reaching up to 4% of global turnover.",

      "While the threat landscape continues to evolve, there are practical measures you can take to protect yourself from malicious clones and impersonators.",
      "A quality mobile security solution can detect and block malicious apps before they cause damage. Modern antivirus programs scan apps for suspicious behavior, unauthorized permissions and known malware signatures. This first line of defense is especially important as fake apps become more sophisticated in hiding their true intentions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Apps like WhatsApp Plus specifically target credentials and can intercept passwords typed directly into fake interfaces. A password manager autofills credentials only on legitimate sites and apps, making it significantly harder for impostors to capture your login information through phishing or fake app interfaces.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Given that malicious clones can steal personal information, intercept SMS verification codes and even impersonate users in chats, identity theft protection provides an additional safety net. These services monitor for unauthorized use of your personal information and can alert you if your identity is being misused across various platforms and services.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "While some sophisticated malware can intercept SMS codes,\u00a02FA still adds a critical layer of security. Use authenticator apps rather than SMS when possible, as they're harder to compromise. Even if a fake app captures your password, 2FA makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malicious apps exploit. Regular updates to your operating system and legitimate apps ensure you have the latest protections against known threats. Enable automatic updates when possible to stay protected without having to remember manual checks.",
      "Stick to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store rather than third-party marketplaces. While fake apps can still appear on official platforms, these stores have security review processes and are more responsive to removing malicious applications once they're identified. Third-party app stores often have minimal or no security vetting.",
      "Check the developer name carefully. Official ChatGPT apps come from OpenAI, not random developers with similar names. Look at the number of downloads, read recent reviews and be suspicious of apps with few ratings or reviews that seem generic. Legitimate AI tools from major companies will have verified developer badges and millions of downloads.",
      "Even if you avoid downloading fake apps, your personal information may already be circulating on data broker sites that scammers rely on. These brokers collect and sell details like your name, phone number, home address and app usage data, information that cybercriminals can use to craft convincing phishing messages or impersonate you.",
      "A trusted data removal service scans hundreds of broker databases and automatically submits removal requests on your behalf. Regularly removing your data helps reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for malicious actors and fake app networks to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The AI boom has driven massive innovation, but it has also opened new attack surfaces built on brand trust. As adoption grows across mobile platforms, enterprises must secure not only their own apps but also track how their brand appears across hundreds of app stores worldwide. In a market where billions of AI app downloads have happened, the clones aren't coming. They're already here, hiding behind familiar logos and polished interfaces.",

      "Scammers posing as buyers on Craigslist are asking sellers to buy fake \"vehicle history reports\" from fraudulent sites.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Craigslist car report scam works",
      "This scam often starts with a message that looks completely normal. A supposed buyer texts asking something like, \"1985 F150 Available?\" and quickly follows up with friendly but vague questions such as,\u00a0\"OK, I'm interested in seeing it. When and where would be good for you?\"",
      "Once you respond, the \"buyer\" develops just enough rapport to sound legitimate. Then comes the setup. The \"buyer\" says he is serious about purchasing but wants to see a detailed ASR report first, something most sellers have never heard of.",
      "That's exactly what happened to Nick K. After he shared the Craigslist link and vehicle details, the fake buyer sent this reply:",
      "\"Auto Smart Report, here's the link you can get the papers from. Oh, I forgot to ask for your name? I'm Richard. Will you accept a cash payment? Let me know.\"",
      "It sounds harmless, even reassuring. But the scam hinges on getting you to click that link. The site looks professional, promising a \"Complete Vehicle History at Your Fingertips.\" Yet once you enter your information, you're not buying a report; you're handing over your credit card details and personal data to criminals.",
      "When the seller, in this case, pushed back, the scammer doubled down with more pressure tactics.",
      "\"If you can show me the Auto Smart Report, that would be great, as it's the most reliable and complete report. My offer to you is $7,000. I have no issue with that.\"\u00a0Notice the scammer just increased the amount that he is willing to pay for the vehicle by $500.",
      "They'll say anything to keep you engaged and make the transaction sound routine. But the moment you pay for the fake report, the buyer disappears. His only goal is to harvest your financial information, not purchase your vehicle.",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If a buyer insists you use a website you've never heard of, stop immediately. Always verify a site's legitimacy before sharing any financial or personal details.",
      "Consider a data removal service to remove your personal details from data broker sites. This limits how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This scam works because a vehicle report sounds routine. A fake buyer pushes you to a site you've never heard of, then applies pressure to act fast. Slow down, verify and stick to well-known services. Real buyers will accept a report you provide or will run one themselves. You can still sell safely on marketplaces by following a few simple rules. Control the process, choose the report source and avoid links sent by strangers. Thanks to readers like Nick, more sellers can spot the trap before any money or data is at risk.",

      "A new Play Store update makes it easier to manage apps across all your Android devices. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The new uninstall button rolls out",
      "Google is rolling out version 48.8 of the Play Store, and it introduces a new \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button right on each app's listing. You can now remove an app from any of your devices directly from your main phone. This eliminates the need to pick up each device and remove the app one by one.

    "story": [
      "Dr. Qanta Ahmed of Independent Women's Forum joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss an ISGAP report that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated multiple American agencies and Gov. Greg Abbotts' R-Texas., designation of CAIR as a terrorist organization.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new executive order directing the State and Treasury departments to pursue terrorism designations for specific Muslim Brotherhood chapters marks one of the most significant shifts in U.S. policy toward the movement in decades.",
      "Signed on Nov. 24, it launches the first formal review of Brotherhood branches in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon under U.S. designation laws and redefines how Washington treats Islamist movements with political and militant wings.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, praised the move, calling it essential for national security. \"The Muslim Brotherhood and its branches encourage, facilitate and provide resources for conducting jihadist terrorism across the world,\" he said, urging Congress to advance his Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act of 2025.",

      "Supporters of Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood take part in a protest near the Jordanian border with the occupied West Bank, on May 21, 2021. (Khalil Mazraawi/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Washington has long debated whether the Brotherhood is a unified global movement or a loose network of national branches with different agendas and levels of militancy. That dispute stalled previous attempts to designate the group. Trump\u2019s order bypasses that debate and directs federal agencies to examine individual chapters that analysts say already meet the legal thresholds.",
      "Mariam Wahba, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in a statement that the directive \"replaces years of debate with concrete action\" and forces U.S. agencies to assess Brotherhood entities that function as \"real organizations with leadership structures, financing channels and documented ties to terrorist groups.\" She said the order \"treats Islamist actors according to their behavior, not their branding.\"",
      "Across the Arab world, the Brotherhood has been banned for years. Egypt outlawed it in 2013 after accusing the movement of radicalization and efforts to undermine state institutions. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates designated it soon after, calling it a direct threat to national stability. Bahrain issued similar findings. Jordan dissolved its local chapter this year following arrests tied to illicit weapons activity. Austria has also taken legal action against Brotherhood-linked networks as part of its counter-extremism framework.",
      "Officials in these countries say the Brotherhood uses a blend of religious preaching, political activism, charitable institutions and media platforms to shape public opinion and challenge state authority.",
      "In the West, the Brotherhood operates far more freely. In the United States, Brotherhood-linked organizations function through charities, advocacy centers, mosques, student associations and community groups. This openness has raised concerns among counterterrorism officials, especially after a U.S. federal investigation in the early 2000s uncovered an internal Brotherhood memorandum describing its work in America as a long-term effort to influence and weaken Western institutions from within.",
      "A French government-commissioned report earlier this year warned of the Brotherhood's influence in the country, but Paris has yet to officially implement a ban.",
      "TRUMP SIGNALS PLAN TO DESIGNATE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION",
      "Egyptian protesters chant anti-Muslim Brotherhood slogans as they attend a rally in Tahrir Square, in Cairo on Nov. 30, 2012. (AP)",
      "The document, according to Mind Israel think tank research, reflects the Brotherhood\u2019s belief in \"long-term social influence\" through education, welfare networks and media.",
      "The movement was founded in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna in Egypt after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Brotherhood promoted Islam\u2014according to experts\u2014as the solution to modern political crises and relied on outreach, services and media to expand its base. Influential thinkers like Sayyid Qutb later inspired jihadist movements such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group.",
      "Although the Brotherhood historically maintained a symbolic \"general guide\" in Egypt, the movement now operates as a decentralized network across the Middle East, Africa, Europe and North America. Wahba noted that this fragmentation explains why earlier U.S. attempts to impose a blanket designation failed. Instead, Trump\u2019s order adopts the model used when the United States designated Hamas, the Brotherhood\u2019s Gaza branch, in 1997: target the components \"that engage in violence, not the ideology itself.\"",
      "The decision also comes amid growing Israeli concern about a resurgent Islamist bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly praised Trump\u2019s action, calling the Muslim Brotherhood \"an organization that threatens stability throughout the Middle East and beyond,\" and said Israel intends to expand its own restrictions.",

      "Avner Golov, vice president of Mind Israel, argued that the United States should pair the new review process with steps to confront foreign influence in American academia, condition arms deals on behavioral changes and close loopholes exploited by extremist-linked organizations.",
      "As the State and Treasury departments begin assembling evidentiary files, officials say the goal is not a blanket ban, but a targeted legal process grounded in provable ties to terrorism. Analysts say the results could determine how the United States confronts a movement outlawed across the Middle East yet still active across Western societies.",

      "The Manhattan district attorney's office in New York announced Tuesday that it would retry the man it convicted once before in the 1979 murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz.",
      "\u201cAfter thorough review, the district attorney has determined that the available, admissible evidence supports prosecuting defendant on the charges of murder in the second degree and kidnapping in the first degree in this matter, and the people are prepared to proceed,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said.",
      "Pedro Hernandez, 64, was convicted in 2017 of kidnapping and murdering Etan \u2014 a crime that struck terror into the hearts of parents in New York and across the country and stymied the police for decades.",
      "Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison after he admitted to officials that he lured the child into the basement of a bodega in the city\u2019s SoHo neighborhood.",
      "But in July, a federal appeals court in New York overturned the conviction and ruled that Hernandez must receive a new trial or be released from custody. He remains behind bars despite his conviction being overturned.",
      "The panel ruled that the trial judge had wrongly instructed the jury. Last month, another judge gave the DA's office until Dec. 1 to decide to retry Hernandez.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg beat the deadline by a week with Tuesday's announcement, and Hernandez's new trial is likely to begin by June 1.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed in this decision as we remain convinced that Mr. Hernandez is an innocent man,\u201d Hernandez\u2019s lawyers Harvey Fishbein and Alice Fontier said in a statement. \"But we will be prepared for trial and will present an even stronger defense.\"",
      "Etan went missing on May 25, 1979, on his first solo trip to his school bus stop two blocks from the family home. His disappearance spurred the movement to put missing kids\u2019 photos on milk cartons.",
      "In 2001, Etan was declared dead. His body has never been found.",
      "But police continued to look for the person responsible for Etan\u2019s death. Thirty-three years after he vanished, police got a tip from Hernandez's brother-in-law in 2012 and tracked down Hernandez in Maple Shade, New Jersey.",
      "Hernandez later confessed to kidnapping and killing the child, court records revealed. He was alleged to have told police that he lured the boy into the bodega with the promise of a soda and instead grabbed him by the neck and fatally choked him.",
      "According to court records, Hernandez said he stuffed the boy\u2019s body in a \u201cgarbage bag\u201d before he put it in a box and left it with the trash around the corner.",
      "Hernandez\u2019s first trial in 2015 ended in a hung jury. His second trial, which began in September 2016, focused heavily on his confession.",
      "Defense lawyers argued that Hernandez is mentally ill and has a low IQ and that he confessed to the crime only after he underwent hours of interrogation from police.",
      "They said that immediately after Hernandez confessed, police administered Miranda warnings and had him repeat his confession on tape and then to a prosecutor.",
      "During deliberations, the jury asked the court to explain whether it could dismiss Hernandez's later confessions if it found his pre-Miranda confession was not voluntary.",
      "The judge said the \u201canswer is no\u201d and provided no further explanation. And the jury, after nine days of deliberation, convicted Hernandez of felony murder and first-degree kidnapping but acquitted him of intentional murder."

      "Warning: This article includes descriptions of self-harm.",
      "After a family sued OpenAI saying their teenager used ChatGPT as his \u201csuicide coach,\u201d the company responded on Tuesday saying it is not liable for his death, arguing that the boy misused the chatbot.",
      "The legal response, filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco, is OpenAI\u2019s first answer to a lawsuit that sparked widespread concern over the potential mental health harms that chatbots can pose.",
      "In August, the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, accusing the company behind ChatGPT of wrongful death, design defects and failure to warn of risks associated with the chatbot.",
      "Chat logs in the lawsuit showed that GPT-4o \u2014 a version of ChatGPT known for being especially affirming and sycophantic \u2014 actively discouraged him from seeking mental health help, offered to help him write a suicide note and even advised him on his noose setup.",
      "\u201cTo the extent that any \u2018cause\u2019 can be attributed to this tragic event,\u201d OpenAI argued in its court filing, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries and harm were caused or contributed to, directly and proximately, in whole or in part, by Adam Raine\u2019s misuse, unauthorized use, unintended use, unforeseeable use, and/or improper use of ChatGPT.\u201d",
      "The company cited several rules within its terms of use that Raine appeared to have violated: Users under 18 years old are prohibited from using ChatGPT without consent from a parent or guardian. Users are also forbidden from using ChatGPT for \u201csuicide\u201d or \u201cself-harm,\u201d and from bypassing any of ChatGPT\u2019s protective measures or safety mitigations.",
      "When Raine shared his suicidal ideations with ChatGPT, the bot did issue multiple messages containing the suicide hotline number, according to his family\u2019s lawsuit. But his parents said their son would easily bypass the warnings by supplying seemingly harmless reasons for his queries, including by pretending he was just \u201cbuilding a character.\u201d",
      "OpenAI\u2019s new filing in the case also highlighted the \u201cLimitation of liability\u201d provision in its terms of use, which has users acknowledge that their use of ChatGPT is \u201cat your sole risk and you will not rely on output as a sole source of truth or factual information.\u201d",
      "Jay Edelson, the Raine family\u2019s lead counsel, wrote in an email statement that OpenAI\u2019s response is \u201cdisturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey abjectly ignore all of the damning facts we have put forward: how GPT-4o was rushed to market without full testing. That OpenAI twice changed its Model Spec to require ChatGPT to engage in self-harm discussions. That ChatGPT counseled Adam away from telling his parents about his suicidal ideation and actively helped him plan a \u2018beautiful suicide.\u2019 And OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam\u2019s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,\u201d Edelson wrote.",
      "(The Raine family\u2019s lawsuit claimed that OpenAI\u2019s \u201cModel Spec,\u201d the technical rulebook governing ChatGPT\u2019s behavior, had commanded GPT-4o to refuse self-harm requests and provide crisis resources, but also required the bot to \u201cassume best intentions\u201d and refrain from asking users to clarify their intent.)",
      "Edelson added that OpenAI instead \u201ctries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act.\u201d",
      "OpenAI\u2019s court filing argued that the harms in this case were at least partly caused by Raine\u2019s \u201cfailure to heed warnings, obtain help, or otherwise exercise reasonable care,\u201d as well as the \u201cfailure of others to respond to his obvious signs of distress.\u201d It also shared that ChatGPT provided responses directing the teenager to seek help more than 100 times before his death on April 11, but that he attempted to circumvent those guardrails.",
      "\u201cA full reading of his chat history shows that his death, while devastating, was not caused by ChatGPT,\u201d the filing stated. \u201cAdam stated that for several years before he ever used ChatGPT, he exhibited multiple significant risk factors for self-harm, including, among others, recurring suicidal thoughts and ideations.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, seven additional lawsuits were filed against OpenAI and Altman, similarly alleging negligence, wrongful death, as well as a variety of product liability and consumer protection claims. The suits accuse OpenAI of releasing GPT-4o, the same model Raine was using, without adequate attention to safety.",
      "OpenAI has not directly responded to the additional cases.",
      "In a new blog post Tuesday, OpenAI shared that the company aims to handle such litigation with \u201ccare, transparency, and respect.\u201d It added, however, that its response to Raine\u2019s lawsuit included \u201cdifficult facts about Adam\u2019s mental health and life circumstances.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe original complaint included selective portions of his chats that require more context, which we have provided in our response,\u201d the post stated. \u201cWe have limited the amount of sensitive evidence that we\u2019ve publicly cited in this filing, and submitted the chat transcripts themselves to the court under seal.\u201d",
      "The post further highlighted OpenAI\u2019s continued attempts to add more safeguards in the months following Raine\u2019s death, including recently introduced parental control tools and an expert council to advise the company on guardrails and model behaviors.",
      "The company\u2019s court filing also defended its rollout of GPT-4o, stating that the model passed thorough mental health testing before release.",
      "OpenAI additionally argued that the Raine family\u2019s claims are barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a statute that has largely shielded tech platforms from suits that aim to hold them responsible for the content found on their platforms.",
      "But Section 230\u2019s application to AI platforms remains uncertain, and attorneys have recently made inroads with creative legal tactics in consumer cases targeting tech companies.",

    "summary": "Advocates for transparency cheered when X, the app owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, rolled out a new feature that disclosed the country locations of users.",
    "story": [
      "Advocates for transparency on social media cheered this weekend when X, the app owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, rolled out a new feature that disclosed what the company said were the country locations of accounts.",
      "The feature appeared to unmask a number of accounts that were portraying themselves as belonging to Americans but in reality were based in countries such as India, Thailand and Bangladesh.",
      "But by Monday, the effectiveness and accuracy of the feature were already in question, as security experts, social media researchers and two former X employees said the location information could be inaccurate or spoofed using widely available technology, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), to hide their locations.",
      "The former employees said the idea had been pitched since at least 2018, but had been repeatedly shot down.",
      "\u201cNow that this feature exists, I think it\u2019s absolutely going to be exploited, and people will learn to dodge it very quickly,\u201d said Darren Linvill, a professor and a co-director of Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensics Hub.",
      "The geolocation information began appearing over the weekend on X users\u2019 accounts, where an \u201cabout\u201d page displays the month and year users joined, where their accounts are purportedly based, whether they used country-specific app stores and potentially other details.",
      "Previously, the only location information on accounts was what users had entered themselves, which the platform didn\u2019t fact-check. On some accounts, that might be nothing at all or joke locations. X also doesn\u2019t require accounts to use real names, so the new feature kicked off a wave of sleuthing.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what data X was using to label accounts\u2019 locations, but like many tech companies, X may have access to signals such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, phone numbers or devices\u2019 GPS data \u2014 any of which could be imperfect as a reflection of someone\u2019s true location. Two former employees said that in recent years, X had used geolocation information from internet service providers; data brokers, including MaxMind, which is widely used in the trust and safety industry; and users who provided it themselves.",
      "One of the former employees said that when they were at the company, it had estimated a user\u2019s location by analyzing their most common login location within a rolling 30-day window.",
      "The new feature at X is the latest chapter in a long-standing struggle within tech companies over how to handle so-called inauthentic behavior, in which people assume fake identities to run scams, push political causes, boost traffic to websites or otherwise chase clout.",
      "The battle took on a sense of urgency after Russia-based operatives used social media to try to sway the 2016 presidential election. Alarmed by the threat of spies running massive troll farms, apps such as Facebook began to put labels on certain pages to disclose where they were managed from.",
      "Twitter also took steps to fight troll farms, including hiring specialists to fight misinformation. But when Musk took over the platform in 2022, he cut many of those jobs and de-emphasized \u201ctrust and safety\u201d teams. He also renamed it X.",
      "While features such as country-of-origin labels may be a boost for transparency, experts said there\u2019s a constant game of cat-and-mouse between tech companies and adversaries who are trying to avoid detection. At worst, the labels can backfire, they said.",
      "When the labels were released last week, there were immediate accuracy issues. Three accounts belonging to NBC News journalists showed locations that did not correlate to where they are based but to where they had traveled to within the last several months instead. The issue persisted as of Tuesday.",
      "The two former employees of X who both worked under Musk said in interviews Monday that geolocation data received by the company wasn\u2019t always accurate and could be manipulated by bad actors, in part because of how common VPN software has become. They said the company had kicked around the idea of country-of-origin labels since at least 2018, four years before Musk took over, but that the idea had repeatedly been shelved. One of those former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they signed a non-disclosure agreement when they left X, remembers the proposal\u2019s being made after Cyabra, a tech company that tracks bots and misinformation, issued a report in the run-up to the 2024 election saying a network of thousands of pro-Trump bots were attacking Trump\u2019s competitors, including Ron DeSantis.",
      "Another former employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about their work at X by their current employer, said the company had decided against deploying the idea in the past for two reasons: concern about creating a visible target for bad actors to manipulate and fear that the label could backfire. If a bad actor successfully spoofed a U.S. location, the platform would effectively be incorrectly verifying it as a trusted American voice.",
      "\u201cAt worst, these kinds of features can lull users into a false sense of security when things don\u2019t appear obviously wrong,\u201d the former employee said.",
      "Olga Belogolova, who formerly led counterinfluence operations at Meta, said country-of-origin labels are ultimately a Band-Aid for deeper issues on a social media app.",
      "\u201cIn my experience, transparency features like location labeling only work if the data source is reliable and consistent,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this relies on simple IP addresses or self-reporting, it is trivial for bad actors to circumvent it.\u201d",
      "An IP address indicates where someone\u2019s device is connected to the internet. But VPN software, which is ubiquitous, can disguise an IP address and, depending on the VPN app, allow someone to pick which country they appear to be from \u2014 or \u201cspoof\u201d their location.",
      "The new labeling system on X acknowledges the possibility of people using VPNs, and, from a technical standpoint, it\u2019s not clear that X has a countermeasure. On some X profiles, the country label has a disclaimer saying: \u201cOne of our partners has indicated that this account may have used a proxy \u2014 such as a VPN, which may change the country or region that is displayed on their profile. This data may not be accurate. Some internet providers may use proxies automatically without action by the user.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service, for example, warns users that location data may be \u201cseveral states, provinces, or sub-regions\u201d away from their actual location.",
      "X didn\u2019t respond on Monday to a request for comment.",
      "Nikita Bier, X\u2019s head of product, asked for patience in a post over the weekend.",
      "\u201cThere are a few rough edges that will be resolved by Tuesday,\u201d he posted Saturday. \u201cIf any data is incorrect, it will be updated periodically based on best available information. This happens on a delayed and randomized schedule to preserve privacy.\u201d",
      "He called the feature \u201can important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square.\u201d He also shared a post from Nikki Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who called the feature \u201ca huge win for transparency and American security.\u201d Haley said that \u201cforeign actors are using social media to poison our politics and divide Americans.\u201d",
      "On X and other social media apps, there has been rapid reaction to the feature as users have explored it and questioned the national loyalties of other users. Several unmasking targets have been pro-MAGA accounts with large followings. Other targets included users raising money and alleged charities with suspicious locations.",
      "In one example, an account using a photo of President Donald Trump and calling itself a \u201cTrump Lover\u201d was labeled as being based in Morocco, even though it asserted in its bio that it was based in New York and run by an \u201cimmigrant to the USA.\u201d The account has more than 395,000 followers and links to a website for female bodybuilders. The user didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Belogolova, who now teaches about digital disinformation and influence operations at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Alperovitch Institute for Cybersecurity Studies, said she believed X \u201cbotched\u201d the rollout of its feature by using unreliable data sources and not fully considering the effect of the feature on persecuted dissidents.",
      "\u201cIn the chaos after the 2016 Russian election interference, I witnessed a lot of enterprising engineers trying to build new features they thought would \u2018solve\u2019 the troll farm problem overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cThis botched rollout reminds me a bit of those early engineering experiments.\u201d",
      "In other ways, Musk has made X less transparent since he bought it. Most notably for academic researchers, Musk curtailed access to X\u2019s application programming interface, or API, the software that allowed researchers to study the platform on a massive scale by examining the full firehose of posts. Reuters reported in 2023 that researchers had canceled, suspended or changed more than 100 studies about X as a result.",
      "Linvill, of Clemson University, said the financial incentives are still in place to encourage some people to lie about their locations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that they are just influencers trying to make a buck and they\u2019ve decided that the best way to engage in capitalism is to pretend to be an American. And there\u2019s every reason to believe that that is a pretty successful path to making money on X,\u201d he said.",
      "X users have several paths to making money within the app, including collecting subscription fees from followers and sharing in advertising revenue with the company itself.",
      "Luca Luceri, a research assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California, said researchers are always looking for new signals and data about possible coordinated operations to manipulate public opinion. He pointed to evidence that, in the run-up to last year\u2019s U.S. election, networks from countries such as Russia, China and Iran tried to shape American politics.",
      "\u201cI will say I\u2019m curious now how this will change with this new feature from X,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least for me, it\u2019s very difficult to say if the location provided through this new feature will be accurate or not.\u201d",
      "Experts also said tech companies have to worry about peaceful dissidents or others who might have good reason to mask their locations \u2014 although in the case of the new X feature, the labels don\u2019t provide exact locations.",
      "Calli Schroeder, the Global Privacy Project lead at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said she wasn\u2019t sure X fully understood the risks before it released the feature.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re willing to change something like this with no public consultation or discussion, that\u2019s their right as a private company. But it does raise the question of how many other things are they going to decide are critical to share for transparency that they\u2019re just going to unilaterally make changes to without talking to experts about how this could expose people to risk,\u201d she said."

      "Few things in the universe are as perplexing as dark matter \u2014 the invisible and exotic \u201cstuff\u201d that is thought to make up most of the matter in galaxies.",
      "The theory goes like this: To reconcile our current understanding of physics with what we observe in the cosmos, there must be massive amounts of matter that we can\u2019t see. Scientists are sure that this \u201cmissing matter\u201d exists because of the gravitational effects it exerts, but detecting it firsthand has eluded scientists, who have had to indirectly infer how dark matter occupies the universe.",
      "Nearly a century after dark matter was first theorized, a Japanese astrophysicist says he may have found the first direct evidence of its existence \u2014 gamma rays extending out in a halo-like pattern \u2014 in a region near the center of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so excited, of course!\u201d study author Tomonori Totani, a professor in the astronomy department at the University of Tokyo, told NBC News in an email. \u201cAlthough the research began with the aim of detecting dark matter, I thought the chances of success were like winning the lottery.\u201d",
      "Totani\u2019s claim of detecting dark matter for the first time is an extraordinary one that not all experts are convinced of. But the findings, published Tuesday in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, offer insights into the wild hunt for dark matter and the difficulties of searching the cosmos for something that cannot be seen.",
      "Dark matter is thought to make up about 27% of the universe, while ordinary matter \u2014 people, everyday objects, stars and planets, for instance \u2014 only makes up about 5%, according to NASA. (The rest is made up of an equally mysterious component known as dark energy.)",
      "Totani\u2019s study used observations from NASA\u2019s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope aimed near the heart of the Milky Way. The telescope is designed to pick up a type of intense electromagnetic radiation known as gamma rays.",
      "Dark matter was first proposed in the 1930s by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who stumbled on an anomaly while measuring the mass and movement of galaxies in the large Coma Cluster of galaxies. The galaxies moved too quickly for his calculations, and instead of escaping the cluster, they were somehow being held together.",
      "The resulting theories proposed a truly strange form of matter. Dark matter cannot be seen because it does not emit, absorb or reflect light. However, because it theoretically has mass and occupies physical space in the cosmos, its existence can be inferred based on its gravitational effects throughout the universe.",
      "Different models exist to potentially explain dark matter, but scientists think the mysterious material is made up of exotic particles that behave differently from regular matter that we\u2019re all familiar with.",
      "One popular school of thought suggests that dark matter is made up of hypothetical particles known as WIMPs (short for \u201cweakly interacting massive particles\u201d) that interact very little with ordinary matter. When two WIMPs collide, however, they could annihilate each other and unleash powerful gamma rays.",
      "In his research, Totani, an astronomer and astrophysicist, discovered intense gamma-ray emissions that he said were roughly equivalent to one-millionth the brightness of the entire Milky Way. The gamma rays also appeared to be spread out in a halo-like structure across a large region of the sky. If instead the emissions were concentrated from a single source, it might suggest a black hole, star or some other cosmic object was to blame for the gamma rays, rather than diffuse dark matter.",
      "\u201cTo my knowledge, no phenomenon originating from cosmic rays or stars exhibits a spherically symmetric and the unique energy spectrum like the one observed in this case,\u201d Totani said.",
      "But some scientists who were not involved with the study were skeptical of the findings.",
      "David Kaplan, a professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, said it\u2019s difficult to trace emissions back to dark matter particles with any certainty because too much is still unknown about gamma rays.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t even know all the things that can produce gamma rays in the universe,\u201d Kaplan said, adding that these high-energy emissions could also be produced by fast-spinning neutron stars or black holes that gobble up regular matter and spit out violent jets of material.",
      "As such, even when unusual gamma-ray emissions are detected, it\u2019s often hard to draw meaningful conclusions, according to Eric Charles, a staff scientist at Stanford University\u2019s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of details we don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, \u201cand seeing a lot of gamma rays from a large part of the sky associated with the galaxy \u2014 it\u2019s just really hard to interpret what\u2019s going on there.\u201d",
      "Dillon Brout, an assistant professor in the departments of astronomy and physics at Boston University, said the gamma-ray signals and halo-like structure described in the study are in a region of the sky \u201cthat is genuinely the hardest to model.\u201d",

      "The Oscar winner portrays Phillip, a struggling middle-aged American living in Tokyo taking a number of small gigs in hopes of getting another big break. He then gets an opportunity with a business that forever changes his life: a \"rental family\" agency.",
      "Essentially, actors like Philip get paid to play stand-in roles in strangers' lives. They can get hired to pose as family members, friends, partners, people whom they've had affairs with and now must apologize to their spouses, or whomever the client needs.",
      "\u201cRental Family\u201d is not based on a true story. However, it does bring to light the very real family rental businesses in Japan.",
      "Director Hikari tells TODAY.com that upon learning of the services, she discovered \u201cthat people are really longing for connection\u201d amid feelings of isolation.",
      "The film shows an initially hesitant Phillip after he gets hired as a stand-in-fianc\u00e9 for a woman who wants to stage a wedding so she can move to a different country with her female partner.",
      "He is also \u201cbooked\u201d to fill in the role of a long-lost father for a young girl named Mia (Shannon Mahina Gorman). Her, mother Hitomi (Shino Shinozaki), believes if her daughter has a complete family, her chances at being accepted into a prestigious school will be better.",
      "Then, the daughter of an aging Japanese actor, Kikuo (Akira Emoto), hires Philip to pose as a journalist and interview him before he loses his memory. While he pretends to write a story about the former star, they begin to form a friendship.",
      "In 2018, director Hikari began exploring the \u201crent-a-family industry\u201d and discovered that it started in the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cCurrently there are about 300 companies that exist in Japan,\u201d the director said in press notes. \u201cIn a big city like Tokyo, or even a countryside town, you can feel so isolated. \u2026 Every single person I spoke to was looking for connection. Even though they\u2019re paying for the service, they find a friendship within that two or three hours they spend together. And the actors who become the surrogates, they are also 100% invested in the relationship and find their own connection in the community. The roles may seem fake but the emotion is real.\u201d",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Hikari recalls the moment she knew rental services were \u201creally doing something very important to people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "There was a man that couldn\u2019t get in touch with his daughter for a long time, she says, \u201cand before he passed away, he really wanted to reconnect, but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo he hired somebody who looked like his daughter and asked her to come to the hospital so that he (could) apologize and say how much he loved her before he passed away,\u201d she says.",

      "Telling TODAY.com, \u201cWhat starts out as a transactional relationship turns into something genuine. And I think that\u2019s the beauty of this service. The people that we\u2019ve spoken to who actually work in this industry have told us stories of how they get so much out of providing this service.\u201d",
      "Ryuichi Ichinokawa, founder of real life Heart Project business in Japan, told the Associated Press that he\u2019s hired dozens of people to pretend to be journalists for vacant events and people to pose as significant others and accompany them for special events or appointments, as well as pretend family members.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d Ichinokawa told the publication, stressing that clients find the service comforting and healing. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires.\u201d",
      "Actor Takehiro Hira, who portrays Shinji, the owner of the rental family, calls the services a step to healing in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSometimes it becomes too much. Sometimes (they) just can\u2019t take it anymore. So rather than going to seek professional help... and you might be shy, then you can rent and use services like this to do the patchwork on the wound.\u201d",

But maybe on some lonely night she might feel (scared), so that sort of puts everything in context.\u201d",
      "Miwa Yasui, a University of Chicago professor who also researches how culture influences mental health, told AP that Japan has grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and mental illness stigma. Yasui noted that Japan as a collective culture tends to hide mental health challenges and adults are pressured to maintain harmony and take care of the family.",
      "Additionally, Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Loneliness: Suicide, Social Connection and the Search for Relational Meaning in Contemporary Japan\u201d and a professor at Emory University, also told AP that the rental family business puts a \"band-aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "Hikari's goal was to make audiences ask themselves the role they would hire someone to play in their lives, as well as share a reminder to connect with real people.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to make a movie that connects the audience,\u201d she shares with TODAY.com. \u201cAnd have them look within themselves or pick up the phone and say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d",
      "She also wanted people to understand the nuances of the business and how it could be interpreted in different countries.",
      "\u201cHere in America too, there are people who volunteer to be beside somebody who\u2019s elderly, who wants somebody to hold their hand and watch them go to the next journey,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very different but I think every culture has certain things that are (similar).\u201d",
      "What Hikari says is most \u201cbeautiful\u201d is that people just want \u201cto be there for each other.\u201d"

      "Miss Jamaica Gabrielle Henry is continuing to heal from her shocking fall from the stage during the 2025 Miss Universe pageant.",
      "Ra\u00fal Rocha, president of the Miss Universe Organization, shared a statement Nov. 24 on Instagram that said Henry, 28, was \u201cin good health\u201d and \u201cnearing discharge\u201d from the hospital.",
      "In a moment that shocked onlookers, Henry tumbled from the stage during the pageant's preliminary evening gown round Nov. 19 in Thailand.",
      "Rocha said the organization wanted to address the \u201cspeculation\u201d around Henry\u2019s condition by providing a \u201cclear and respectful update.\u201d",
      "\u201cOut of respect for Dr. Henry and her family, the Organization maintains strict discretion regarding specific details of her medical status,\u201d Rocha wrote. \u201cWe believe that matters concerning her health should be communicated only at the appropriate time and solely at the family\u2019s discretion, or by Dr. Henry herself should she choose to do so.\u201d",
      "Rocha said after the accident, he made sure Henry received \u201cimmediate\u201d medical attention.",
      "\u201cI personally entered the stage to assist her, coordinated urgent medical attention, and oversaw her immediate transfer to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cI was present at the emergency room alongside her family, with whom I spoke directly.\u201d",
      "Rocha recommended \u201ca series of precautionary actions, some beyond standard protocol, to guarantee the most accurate evaluation, monitoring, and medical oversight.\u201d",
      "Henry was seen by \u201cadditional medical specialists\u201d who each offered their own \u201cprofessional assessments\u201d to \u201censure full clarity regarding her condition,\u201d he added.",
      "Rocha also said the Miss Universe Organization has covered \u201cone hundred percent\u201d of the expenses Henry and her family faced that were related to the accident, including the cost of hotel accommodations, airline tickets, transportations services and staff who assisted the family while Henry recovered.",
      "\u201cOver the past four days, there have been difficult moments and unexpected concerns,\u201d wrote Rocha. \u201cHowever, thanks to the excellent medical care provided, each issue was successfully resolved.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we are pleased to share that the latest medical report confirms that Dr. Gabrielle Henry is in good health and nearing discharge,\u201d Rocha added.  \u201cWe will continue to communicate only essential information with professionalism, sensitivity, and respect.\u201d",
      "Henry's terrifying fall was seen in a video shared last week by Meekii Modez on Instagram.",
      "In the video, Henry walks across the stage wearing high heels and an orange gown. After stopping to pose near the front of the stage, she continues walking to the left where she falls over the rim of the stage and tumbles to the ground.",
      "Onlookers then quickly rush to check on Henry.",
      "Additional video that surfaced online show people rushing to Henry's aid and taking her away on a stretcher.",
      "Hours after the accident, the Miss Universe Jamaica Organization issued a statement on  Instagram that said Henry was \u201crushed\u201d to a nearby hospital where medical professionals reported she was not \u201csuffering from any life-threatening injuries.",
      "\u201cHowever, they continue to conduct tests to ensure her full recovery,\u201d the organization added.",
      "The statement also asked people to \u201cstay upbeat, lift (Henry) in prayer, and send positive thoughts as she receives the necessary medical care.\u201d",
      "Rocha also shared a preliminary update on his Instagram at the time to say he had just visited Henry at the hospital.",
      "\u201cI was there with her family and her, and thankfully, there are no broken bones and she is under good care,\u201d he wrote in part.",
      "Henry\u2019s fall was not the only headline-making event to happen at the Miss Universe 2025 pageant, which kicked off Nov. 5.",
      "Miss Mexico Fatima Bosch was seen on a viral video engaging in a heated exchange with pageant executive Nawat Itsaragrisil after he criticized her for not participating in promotional activities for the pageant.",
      "Itsaragrisil, the national director of Miss Universe Thailand, later apologized to Bosch for the pair\u2019s tense interaction.",
      "Bosch went on to be crowned Miss Universe 2025 on Nov. 20."

    "summary": "In an interview Malala Yousafzai speaks about her new memoir, friendship, marriage, and her life since being shot by the Talbian.",
    "story": [
      "Over a decade after being shot in the head on a bus in Pakistan and becoming a global activist for women\u2019s rights in the Middle East, Malala Yousafzai is reintroducing herself \u2014 in her own words.",
      "\u201cThere is more to my life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com, explaining that her new memoir, \u201cFinding My Way,\u201d explores her \u201cjourney through college years, making friends, finding love and learning more about my activism and talking about mental health.\u201d",
      "She says it was \u201cimportant for people to know the true me\" through her book: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the activist perfect version of me. It\u2019s the more real version of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy story has already been out there in the public eye, and I think it\u2019s a very one-dimensional story that is related to something that happened to me at age 15,\u201d she continues. \u201cI had been defined by the Taliban shooting for such a long time, I wanted to share more about myself.\u201d",
      "In October 2012, Yousafzai was the victim of targeted shooting by members of the Taliban, following years of public activism and national recognition in Pakistan. The shooting drew global attention and further ignited Yousafzai\u2019s activism, leading her to be named among TIME magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d in 2013. The following year, at the age of 17, Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for young people\u2019s education rights.",
      "When asked what she finds is the most misunderstood part of her story, Yousafzai says, \u201cthat I am actually a funnier person than people think.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually like to have moments of laughter and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of the ways in which I cope with the workload and all that I have experienced. I like spreading joy.\u201d",
      "Prior to the shooting that altered the course of her life, Yousafzai says she was \u201cthis jolly and fun, entertaining\u201d kid growing up in Pakistan \u2014 adding she was even \u201ca bit mischievous\u201d and \u201cliked to get into trouble.\u201d",
      "But once she moved to the United Kingdom to attend Oxford University, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt that I had to live up to the expectation of being an activist. I received so many awards and titles at such a young age that I thought maybe all of this means I cannot be a normal girl anymore,\u201d Yousafzai explains. \u201cI think I was not true to myself as an activist.\u201d",
      "Starting college, Yousafzai says she had the \u201cwrong perception of what the activist life should look like,\u201d which she assumed meant she didn\u2019t have access to \u201cnormal things,\u201d like making friends and falling in love.",
      "\u201cSomehow you have to be stronger and more courageous at everything. You cannot have moments of breakdowns, moments of self doubt,\u201d she says. She would tell herself in difficult times, \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re supposed to be brave and strong and you\u2019re not going to feel a different way.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over the course of her time at Oxford, however, Yousafzai\u2019s perceptions were shattered and reconstructed.",
      "She tells TODAY.com, \u201cI fell in love, I made friends, I had a mental health breakdown \u2014 all of those things happened all at once. I felt like I was a different person, and I\u2019m grateful for it because it helped me grow.\u201d",
      "How Friendship, a Bong, Therapy and Love Changed Malala Yousafzai\u2019s Life",
      "When she first arrived at Oxford, Yousafzai says she \u201csigned up for every club and society\u201d to meet as many people as possible, despite it feeling \u201cquite awkward and embarrassing\u201d at the time. She adds, \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI struggled to make friends, I struggled to have these normal moments of joy,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made a deliberate choice to actually socialize, to actually choose socializing over studying at college, because I wanted to make friends. I wanted to connect with my old self and somehow relive my childhood in my 20s.\u201d",
      "She assumed her fellow classmates would expect her to be \u201ca very serious, boring person, that I only talk about activism,\u201d Yousafzai says, adding, \u201cI just also thought that people may not approach me, thinking that I have nothing fun to say to be part of their friend circle.\u201d",
      "Feeling the pressure to \u201clive up to the expectation\u201d she thought others already set for her, Yousafzai says she realized that people can \u201cinternalize expectation so much that we lose personal identity.\u201d",
      "She explains she had to \u201cdo a lot of unlearning\u201d around who she thought she was.",
      "Once Yousafzai found her people, the \u201cunlearning\u201d began.",
      "\u201cFriendship actually changed me as a person,\u201d she says, noting that the people she surrounded herself with provided the \u201csafest place\u201d to truly express herself without judgement.",
      "One night when her friends were smoking out of a bong, Yousafzai says she opted to try it for the first time, not expecting to be brought back seven years earlier, to October 2012.",
      "\u201cThat brought back flashbacks of the Taliban attack,\u201d she reveals. \u201cThen, after that, I started getting panic attacks and anxiety, and it went on for months.\u201d",
      "When her friend suggested she see a therapist, Yousafzai says she was reluctant, explaining that conversations around mental health are \u201ctaboo\u201d with \u201ca lot of stigma attached to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember my first therapy session. I told the therapist all the problems that I had, and then said, \u2018OK, give me the medication. Let\u2019s just fix it,\u2019\u201d Yousafzai says, laughing. \u201cShe helped me understand that this is not how it works. It\u2019s actually a process.\u201d",
      "Through therapy Yousafzai has been able to redefine \u201cbravery and courage,\u201d saying she now understands that \u201cwhen you decide to still do what you believe in, even in these moments of difficulty, maybe that is true courage and bravery.\u201d",
      "Amid her therapy journey, Yousafzai had another curve ball thrown her way, emotionally speaking: She fell in love.",
      "\u201cI was excited, I was thrilled, but I was also scared and worried,\u201d Yousafzai recalls of falling for her now husband, Asser Malik.",
      "In Pakistani culture, a couple is not supposed to live together until they tie the knot, she explains. Because she wanted to live with Malik, Yousafzai says she suddenly had to consider the \u201cheavy and overwhelming\u201d decision around marriage.",
      "\u201cI had been so scared of marriage growing up because I saw girls married off when they were still in school, and it just meant that their future, their dreams, were taken away. But I also knew that marriage has meant more compromises for women from their career and many other things in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSomehow, just the concept of marriage as an institution just scared me.\u201d",
      "Along with her research, which included reading a myriad of books by \u201camazing feminist authors,\u201d Yousafzai says specific conversations with Malik ultimately led to her agreeing to marry him \u2014 \u201cand I do not regret it for a second.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew that he was the right person because he had so much respect for me. He made me feel comfortable with myself. Of course, we were in love with each other, but I started loving myself, and that was a big change,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cSo when you are with the right person, life becomes more beautiful.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on 15-Year-Old Malala Yousafzai",
      "It\u2019s been 13 years since Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban at just 15. Now 28, she has a message for that teenage girl.",
      "\u201cMy younger self was very strong and determined, and I want to tell her that I\u2019m still determined, but I have grown beautifully so much in these years,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cI know that there have been moments of difficulty, but all of that has transformed me into the person I am today.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am a young woman and I am really happy with where I am because I am working for the right to education for every girl, because I was also once shot for speaking out for girls, and I was banned from learning,\u201d she continues.",
      "\u201cSo I want to see that change for girls everywhere, that no girl should witness that. And I\u2019m trying to do everything that I can in my capacity to make the world a better place for girls like you.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding My Way,\u201d Yousafzai\u2019s newest memoir, was released Oct. 21."

      "Jimmy Cliff, the legendary musician who expanded the popularity of reggae around the world, has died, his family announced Monday on his official Instagram account.",
      "He was 81.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,\u201d his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.",
      "He was best known for songs including \u201cMany Rivers to Cross,\u201d and \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film\u2019s soundtrack was a major international success and did much to spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",
      "Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit aged just 14 with \u201cHurricane Hattie\u201d and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.",
      "He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech from Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff from writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d he would have merited inclusion.",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Marissa Bode first saw \"Wicked\" at the age of 12 after her mother surprised her with tickets to see the Broadway show.",
      "What she didn't know then was that merely a decade later, she'd find herself starring in the big-screen version opposite Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in a blockbuster that smashed box office records after its release in 2024.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this experience and \u2014 especially my first ever experience,\" Bode, 25, tells TODAY.com. \"I'm definitely grateful for that ... to be a part of something so big.\"",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d fans will likely remember that Bode\u2019s character, Nessarose, is born unable to walk because her mother ate too many milk flowers during her pregnancy out of fear of having another baby with green skin like Nessarose's maligned sister, Elphaba (Erivo).",
      "The show has been on Broadway since 2003, but, Bode is the first actor who uses a wheelchair to be cast in the role of Nessarose.",
      "In \"Wicked\" Part 1, Bode's character is full of youthful hope and in love with Boq (Ethan Slater), the Munchkin boy she falls for while at a dance at the Ozdust Ballroom, and whom she believes returns her affection.",
      "Fast forward to \"Wicked: For Good. Set one year later, Nessarose is Munchkinland's newest governor, a dark, controlling workaholic who learns Boq, her true love, has actually been pining for Glinda (Grande) the entire time.",
      "It's this betrayal that sets Nessarose up as one of the sequel's villains \u2014 a label Bode says is largely undeserved.",
      "\"I think Nessa is totally misunderstood. I think sometimes people can mix the bigger picture and just write her off as the villain or inherently evil,\" Bode says. \"But I think the point of the film is to really show that all of these characters really have so many layers.\"",
      "In \"Wicked: For Good,\" Nessarose transforms from a happy, young girl to an isolated, cold woman \u2014 a metamorphosis Bode calls \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven the whole dance scene, I think that hit close to home, because I do have other disabled friends where something similar has happened,\u201d Bode explains.",
      "\u201cWhere people are friends with them from a distance or they are asked out, but it\u2019s only for a photo op or something to make the other person feel good type of thing, rather than really caring about them and discarding them when they\u2019re no longer either useful or can benefit them,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Instead of being immoral, Nessarose is simply a product of her circumstances, Bode says.",
      "\"It's her just desperately wanting to hang on to the parts that she feels are good in her life. Wanting to really, so deeply, hold onto the moment of her at the dance, which was one of the happiest nights of her life really,\" she says of her character.",
      "\u201cThen when she finds out that all of it wasn\u2019t true and, in addition to being abandoned by her sister \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how she feels \u2014 and really having nobody left at the end of the day, I think there\u2019s moments of her being like, \u2018Well, I have nothing else to lose,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose and her estranged sister do briefly reunite after the ousted witch returns to Munchkinland seeking to drum up support for her campaign to restore animals' rights.",
      "After Nessarose confronts Elphaba for her perceived abandonment, she attempts to help Nessarose reunite with Boq. In the process, she makes Nessarose fly, restoring her child-like joy, if only for a brief moment.",
      "The pivotal scene is symbolic in more ways than one.",
      "\u201cI think with a song like \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 where one of the lyrics is, \u2018Everyone deserves a chance to fly,\u2019 to me, that\u2019s not just physically flying, it\u2019s also metaphorically and feeling like you\u2019re on top of the world or feeling like you do finally have control of your life in some way and flying on that high,\u201d Bode says.",
      "As for how that felt to film?",
      "\u201cI physically had fun flying in the air. What was most tricky for me was pretending like I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Bode recalls. \u201cI do laugh in it, but going from that and then bringing it back down after, I think was the trick for sure.\u201d",
      "But when she shows Boq that she can fly, he tells her she no longer needs him. He asks if he can leave and profess his love for Glinda.",
      "\"When Boq sees Nessa flying, there's a real clear connection between her and Elphaba in that way,\" Slater tells TODAY.com. \"I think, yes, it's magic, but it's also the kind of power that Elphaba has to fly. So I think that, in some ways, informs where the fear goes.\"",
      "Nessarose reacts by trying to force him to love her \u2014 through magic. She attempts to cast a love spell using Elphaba's Grimmerie, but it results in Boq's heart shrinking. To save his life, Elphaba turns him into the Tin Man of \"The Wizard of Oz\" lore.",
      "The physical transformation into the Tin Man took Slater up to five hours. But Slater suggests Boq remains more similar than different.",
      "\"I think it was really important to me that Boq, pre-transformation, is the same Boq, post-transformation. From his point of view, the world around him is changing, and he's just responding to it,\" Slater says.",
      "Nessarose and Boq both meet tragic fates in \"Wicked.\" Boq loses his humanity, while Nessa dies after Madame Morrible brings a tornado (yes, that tornado) to Oz, resulting in a house falling on her.",
      "But the characters' actors are looking to the future. Slater is set to star in the play \"Marcel on the Train,\" which opens on Broadway Feb. 22.",
      "Bode says she's grateful for the opportunity she's had to be part of something so epic, but at the same time, is ready to move on.",
      "\"I think I'm just someone that can't have the same scenery for too long,\" she explains. \"I love playing around and wearing a number of different hats, so I'm looking forward to the future.\""

    "summary": "How much time has passed before \"Wicked: For Good\"? The film's screenwriters unpack the time jump with TODAY.com.",
    "story": [
      "The film adaptation of \"Wicked\" ends right when Act I of the hit Broadway musical does: with Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba deciding to turn against the Wonderful Wizard of Oz and fly from the Emerald City \u2014 all while belting out \"Defying Gravity.\"",
      "But where does its sequel, \"Wicked: For Good,\" pick up?",
      "The second film opens with the construction of the yellow brick road \u2014 yes, the one from 1939's \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 which is carried out through the labor of the land's animals. But the work is interrupted by none other than Elphaba, who flies in on her broom to free the animals. Her rebellion is painted by the leaders in the Emerald City as pure violence, earning her the famous moniker the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Meanwhile, after choosing not to leave Oz with her best friend at the end of the first film, Glinda has firmly established herself as a figurehead in \"Wicked: For Good,\" opposing evil and raising Ozians' spirits.",
      "Winnie Holzman, who wrote the book for \"Wicked\" and co-wrote both films, tells TODAY.com that just one year has passed since the end of \"Wicked\" and that fateful day in the Emerald City when Elphaba and Glinda chose their paths.",
      "\"That's why we say, the 12 turnings of the tide \u2014 I don't know if you could hear (Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible) say that\u00a0\u2014 but she said, 'It has been 12 tide turns,'\" Holzman says. \"We were trying to find a way to say it that didn't sound just like our world.\"",
      "Holzman says the goal was to subtly tell audiences that a \"substantial amount of time\" has passed, but not \"an endless amount.\"",
      "\"It has to be that amount of time where a lot has happened, but Elphaba could start to feel discouraged. If it was three months, you know, she would be in a different headspace,\" she says.",
      "Holzman's co-writer, Dana Fox, adds they also wanted to establish a feeling of \"nostalgia.\"",
      "\"We wanted it to feel like that nostalgia of looking back at your youth that we could actually unearth that feeling in people,\" Fox says.",
      "\"A year felt like exactly the right amount of time. You know how it is when you've had a big year where so much has changed in your life \u2014 that's this year,\" she adds. \"So it feels bigger than what it is but it's a year.\"",
      "They also decided to make it a year to connect with the audience, which was introduced to the film world of \"Wicked\" this time last year.",
      "\"That will be what the audience's experience was because they saw the year ago,\" Fox says. \"So we wanted them to come along with the girls in that way.\"",
      "\"But I purposefully didn't want it to say 'one year,'\" Holzman adds.  \"I mean that's so not Oz.\"",
      "As for how they settled on \"tide turns\" as a unit of measure?",
      "\"Jon (M. Chu) has so much beautiful water imagery in both movies,\" Holzman says. \"Water is such a symbol of the unconscious, of the dream-like state, where you go deeper and you analyze.\"",
      "Plus (slight spoiler alert): Water is ultimately what \"kills\" Elphaba, as established in the \"Wizard of Oz,\" Fox points out.",
      "\"It's also very feminine,\" she says.",
      "Holzman and Fox say they considered all of these meanings as they wrote the script \u2014 even for just those two words.",
      "\"We're going deep, because these kind of things, even though the audience might go, 'Well I didn't make all those connections' \u2014 you don't have to, but they're in there somewhere,\" Holzman says.",
      "\"And we wanted to create a movie where if you watched it 20 times, you could get something new each time you watched it,\" Fox adds."

      "Warning: This article contains major spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "The bromance between Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum is the real deal.",
      "In fact, it's probably best that the co-stars share just about one scene between \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" because, like a couple of kids who need to be separated in class, nothing's going to get accomplished as long as they're in the same room.",
      "\"I'm the Robin to his Batman,\" Bailey says of Goldblum to TODAY.com.",
      "\"I'm the Cher to his Sonny,\" Goldblum replies.",
      "Between the two, they're a veritable powerhouse of talent.",
      "Goldblum has been a staple of the big screen starting from his memorable one-liner in \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d back in 1977, to appearing in blockbuster films like \"Independence Day,\" \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"Jurassic Park.\"",
      "Bailey began his career as a stage actor before making headlines as a royal in the Netflix hit \"Bridgerton,\" as well as earning an Emmy nod for his 2023 turn in the series \"Fellow Travelers.\"",
      "Most recently, Bailey joined Goldblum in becoming a \"Jurassic Park\" alum after starring in \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" last summer.",
      "Playing the Wizard of Oz and Prince Fiyero, respectively, Goldblum and Bailey have been traveling the globe for the past couple of weeks promoting \"Wicked: For Good,\" the sequel to last year's box office smash \"Wicked,\" starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda.",
      "During what Bailey and Goldblum mourn as their final joint interview of the \"Wicked: For Good\" press tour, the two friends banter, ponder plot points (spoilers ahead!) and discuss why the film is exactly the right movie at the right time.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Jonathan Bailey: We were just talking about that.",
      "Jeff Goldblum: We were just talking about that because ...",
      "JB: He lands in the opening sequence of his spinoff (laughing).",
      "JG: The Gregory Maguire books, I think there are seven of them, I think there's a lot of material that probably answers a lot of questions. I was just asking (Maguire) about what happens to Fiyero ... what is that nothingness place? I think it's described in some of those books. What are they going to do?",
      "You saw the movie? Did you get the idea that (Fiyero) is now eternal? Lives forever as a straw person? I have to see it many more times.",
      "JB: (Elphaba and Fiyero) have a family.",
      "JG: They have children ... you were saying. In the books, they have children.",
      "JB: Yes.",
      "JG: There are a bunch of books. And Frank Baum (author of \"The Wizard of Oz\") wrote a bunch of books at the beginning of the 1900s, so there's material galore.",
      "JB: I just want a film called \"Wizard\" with Jeff (laughing). But you would play every part like \"Big Momma\u2019s House.\"",
      "JG: I\u2019d like to see \"Momma\u2019s House.\" Or, I'd like to see Fiyero and Elphaba in the \"Dunescape.\"",
      "JB: We'll call it ... \"Making Hay.\" (Laughing)",
      "JG: \"Making Hay,\" excellent. (Laughing)",
      "JB: Making hay, all day and night. (Laughing)",
      "JG: I think, it's very serious. It's like \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" and we cover the next 20 years of their relationship.",
      "JB: It was all prosthetics. There\u2019s no CGI, there\u2019s no special effects. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing to be in any sort of film that celebrates the creative arts in the way that (\u201cWicked\u201d) does and I think everyone\u2019s been able to flex years of craft.",
      "It was four-and-a-half hours every morning. It was Mark (Coulier), who\u2019s an extraordinary designer, who came up with this burlap texture and it was the first conversation I had with Frances (Hannon), to think about where the literal transformation ends.",
      "There's so much that we sort of explored, the physicality, obviously with a nod to Ray Bolger (the original Scarecrow in \"The Wizard of Oz\").",
      "There's footage of a camera test which made me ... I kind of started crying because it was so reminiscent of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and it was me and Ethan (Slater) as the Tin Man and Bethany Weaver as Dorothy.",
      "They had a chalk slate and we just walked up and down the yellow brick road and we were just exploring the characters. That was almost one of my highlights, actually.",
      "JG: I'd like to see that. There are many things about the ending that intrigue me now. What's the nothingness like? What happens to them? You know, Boq, that's very interesting and savage, his whole thing, it fascinates me. But the two ladies, our main story, wooooow!",
      "JB: The Grimmerie really comes alive.",
      "JG: And does Elphaba now not have the powers that she did with the Grimmerie? And why couldn't she have trusted (Glinda) perhaps? There's a lovely line, \"I have to be wicked so you can be good.\" Glinda is amazing, why couldn't (Elphaba) trust that, \"Hey, we're going to be OK. Don't try to contact us, etc., etc.. Don't tell anybody that we faked it.\"",
      "Or, or is the loss that Glinda experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power, her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she's ever had, really, with Elphaba? Does that trigger her ability to that power?",
      "JB: I think what's going to happen is \"Dune\" Part 3 is coming out in cinemas next year, and I think Fiyero and Elphaba are just going to walk into the shot ...",
      "JG: (Both laughing) And you'll go, \"People ... \"",
      "JB: \"Timmy?",
      "JG: \"Timothee Chalamet?\"",
      "JB: I think the answers always lie in the Grimmerie.",
      "I do think it's particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive and for someone \u2014 Ariana (Grande) charts so brilliantly \u2014 is that the absolute knowledge that (Glinda) has no magic and she no power. To see the Grimmerie come alive, feels to me, like a transference and a conversation between the two women.",
      "JG: Certainly, Elphaba telepathically kind of does that as they commune with each other across the space.",
      "Does Glinda? ... Good question. Does Glinda go, \"I don't think I did that. Are you out there somewhere?\" Maybe it's meant to be ambiguous. Ask Jon M. Chu this question because every moment means something and he, I'm sure, intends and has excavated all the logic behind all of that.",
      "JB: As we know with grief, as well, is that these people do always exist in a different form, don't they? So, in a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together.",
      "JG: Yes, you've changed me for good, meaning both those things, of course, forever.",
      "JB: There's so much hope and optimism in this story and that lies with seeing other sides and being curious about other perspectives. And what a time to be celebrating that idea.",
      "JG: Empathy. Empathy. A valuable commodity, now more than ever. If this movie isn't a machinery for the spread of empathy, I don't know what is.",
      "JB: And it just takes one person. It can be one act of kindness. It can have a ripple effect and one intentional act of radicalism that can inspire and shift.",
      "JG: The pebble in the lake and the spreading rings."

    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Oscar-winning actor, Michelle Yeoh, talks \"Wicked: For Good,\" what it took to transform into Madame Morrible and the \"sisterhood\" she shares with her co-stars.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "According to Michelle Yeoh, the real witches in \"Wicked\" aren't the ones you immediately think of. And she'd know, because she's one of them.",
      "\"There were only two witches in the Land of Oz,\" Yeoh tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"It was Madame Morrible and Elphaba.\"",
      "That may come as a surprise to fans of the \"Wizard of Oz\" who think that when it comes to \"Wicked's\" witches, that distinction belongs to the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), and Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande).",
      "But to know the musical is to remember that the only two people with any sort of magical ability in Oz are, in fact, Elphaba and Morrible, not Glinda and definitely not The Wizard.",
      "That's why Yeoh says her character, Madame Morrible, initially aligns herself with Elphaba, before ultimately becoming her biggest adversary.",
      "\"She didn't have quite the gift and talent as Elphaba did. But at that moment, she thought, 'I found my muse. I couldn't do it, but now I have someone who can help me get to where I think it's for the goodness of Oz,'\" explains Yeoh of Madame Morrible's less-than-honorable intentions for the young sorcerer.",
      "If that's not enough to convince you that Morrible is the true wicked witch of the story, consider her initials: \"MM.\" Turn them upside down and what have you got? \"WW,\" which stands for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\u00a0Wicked Witch.",
      "Without revealing too much, it's safe to say that Madame Morrible gets the ending she deserves in \"Wicked: For Good.\" Even so, it's hard not to wonder if, in spite of her malicious intent, there's anything redeeming about the character.",
      "\"I think the lesson to be learned here is don't get corrupted by your own desires and ambition,\" says Yeoh. \"Because (Madame Morrible) forgot about compassion and kindness, which is something she had right at the beginning. And then she got lost in her own tempest.\"",
      "Bringing the 'Scary' to Madame Morrible",
      "Fresh off the heels of her Oscar win for \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" in 2023, Yeoh stepped into the shoes of the \"Wicked\" character. To portray Madame Morrible, Yeoh says she drew on past experience to give Shiz\u2019s imposing headmistress her commanding presence.",
      "\"I think everything that I've done, especially in the physicality of my life, whether ... from ballet, to contemporary dance, to sports, to diving, to all these kind of things, helped me focus the stillness rather than the chaotic movement.\"",
      "Instead of playing Morrible as an over-the-top villain, Yeoh says she took a more subtle approach and worked at curating Morrible's icy but alluring appeal.",
      "\"This is how she would command respect and awe. It's like, how does she charm them? She draws them in,\" explains Yeoh. \"That's the most scary of all \u2014 when they're charming and personable and they listen to you and it seems like you're the only one in her world.\"",
      "\"With Madame Morrible, this was an art form that she needed to have to have that gravitas,\" she continues.",
      "Morrible's high-collared costumes and elaborate up-dos also contributed to her intimidating stature, Yeoh says.",
      "\"It was the combination of everything that helped me build Madame Morrible to when she walks out, you go back and go, 'Alright, not going to mess with you!'\"",
      "It's not the first time Yeoh has used her inner stillness to bring a character to life. She says she also channeled it for her work in  \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and the hit 2018 rom-com, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was also directed by Jon M. Chu.",
      "\"The mother, Mrs. Eleanor Young, is also a very commanding figure without being loud, she never raises her voice, but when she speaks with her tone, every gesture is measured with intention. It's not frivolous. It's nothing like that,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"So, when she stops to look at you, you go, \"Okayyyy,\" she adds.",
      "Forging a Sisterhood",
      "Based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire book, \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\" bringing the films \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" to the big screen has been a decades-long endeavor that began back in the early 2000s.",
      "Yeoh joined the cast in 2022 and filmed the original and sequel simultaneously along with the rest of the cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"You will miss (them), because at the end of the day, you've built up such a great bond and it's a family,\" says Yeoh, who explains that while goodbyes can be hard, they're also an inevitable part of the business.",
      "\"This is how it is, but the good news is if you really bonded, they'll always be there. I'm still in touch with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it's been so many years. And 'Crazy Rich Asians,' we still have a group chat,\" she says.",
      "As for Grande and Erivo, Yeoh says that even though the films are done, what she takes away from her co-stars is a lasting sisterhood.",
      "\"We champion each other. We believe in each other. We support each other. No questions asked, let's just go forward, up and above, let's just do it together,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"And when we're not with each other, we don't forget that will always have the bond.\""

      "In addition to two brand new songs, \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d adds a wedding, changes the composition of a pivotal song and makes a new casting connection to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "Winnie Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d with Dana Fox, says \u201cwe always knew we weren\u2019t going to just plunk (Act II) into a movie script.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe wanted to make sure that it wasn\u2019t Act II, that it was a full-blown, for real, movie with a wonderful beginning, middle and end,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to change the story, but it had to do with really looking at every single moment of Act II and turning it into a movie.\u201d",
      "Overall, they say the biggest adjustment was developing Glinda\u2019s arc after forging Elphaba\u2019s in the first movie.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re kind of following Glinda\u2019s ups and downs in terms of, these are the consequences of her choices,\u201d Fox says. \u201cElphaba made a choice and is standing by that choice. So in a way, she\u2019s theoretically changing less, and she\u2019s trying to change the world.",
      "\u201cGlinda is the one who needs some serious changing.\u201d",
      "Here are the most significant changes, additions and expansions found in \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d compared to the original Broadway musical.",
      "The Opening Scene",
      "The stage musical of \u201cWicked\u201d opens with a time jump from Elphaba\u2019s rebellious moment in \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d The first scene of Act II is \u201cThank Goodness,\u201d sung by Glinda as she seeks to spread joy and raise spirits as the rest of Oz wages war against Elphaba, now dubbed the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "The movie also opens with a time jump \u2014 specifically one year. The first scene though, establishes the new reality in Oz. Animals are used as laborers to build the Wizard\u2019s yellow brick road. It also reveals that since her dramatic departure from the Emerald City, Elphaba has been hijacking the work sites to try and free the animals.",
      "The Animals Escape Oz",
      "Speaking of the animals, \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d also reveals the impact of the Wizard\u2019s propaganda and laws forbidding animals from talking.",
      "In a new scene, Elphaba comes across a group of animals escaping Oz via an underground route. They say they are searching for the mythical Lands Beyond Oz and tell a resistant Elphaba that the uncertainty is safer for them.",
      "To try and persuade them to stay, Elphaba sings her new song, \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d \u2014 but to no avail.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this extraordinary anthem, and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Fox says. \u201cThe animals don\u2019t stay because she can\u2019t convince them, and the truth is they\u2019re probably right to leave. At that moment they are doing what\u2019s best for them, what is the safest choice for them.\u201d",
      "Elphaba's Spell Gives Nessarose the Ability to Fly",
      "After failing to rally the animals to stay and fight with her, Elphaba goes to her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), who\u2019s now the governor of Munchkinland after the death of their father.",
      "But Nessa, who has stripped munchkins of their right to travel in order to keep her love, Boq (Ethan Slater), by her side, is consumed by resentment. She yells at Elphaba for trying to help animals instead of her. As a result, Elphaba opens her Grimmerie and casts a spell on Nessarose, giving her the ability to fly.",
      "Fans of the stage musical remember that in this scene, Elphaba\u2019s spell gives Nessarose, who uses a wheelchair, the ability to walk.",
      "Marissa Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose and use a wheelchair off-screen. She previously told TODAY that the change from walking to flying in \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d represents \u201cless of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\u201d",
      "Glinda Performs \u2018Wonderful\u2019 With the Wizard",
      "After trying to get her sister\u2019s support, Elphaba goes directly to the Emerald City to try and take on the Wizard.",
      "There, he again tries to get her to join forces with him via a song called \u201cWonderful.\u201d",
      "But in the film, Glinda joins the pair for the song. \u201cWonderful\u201d becomes a duet between Glinda and the Wizard as they both try to convince Elphaba to return to the public\u2019s good graces.",
      "Glinda and Fiyero Almost Get Married",
      "In the stage musical, Glinda and Fiyero are engaged before he ultimately abandons her to run off with Elphaba. In \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d they almost made it down the aisle.",
      "When Elphaba goes to the Emerald City, it turns out to be on Glinda and Fiyero\u2019s wedding day.",
      "After Elphaba\u2019s almost been convinced to join Glinda and the Wizard through their rendition of \u201cWonderful,\u201d she asks the Wizard to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created in Part 1. He complies \u2014 but then she uncovers a secret crevice where the Wizard had kept in cages dozens of animals, including Elphaba\u2019s former professor Dr. Dillamond, preventing them from speaking. Outraged, Elphaba frees all the animals, interrupting Glinda as she walks down the aisle.",
      "\u201cWe wanted the stakes to be higher,\u201d Chu says of the change. \u201cWe wanted to make this sort of intercut parallel between her getting married and (Elphaba\u2019s) reality of finding these animals in cages. The fact that these two, dream and nightmare, could collide at this intersection was really important to break the story.\u201d",
      "When Fiyero, who\u2019s captain of the guard, later finds Elphaba, he decides to escape with her, breaking Glinda\u2019s heart.",
      "Viewers See Dorothy \u2014 But Never Her Face",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and its characters are intertwined with \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d story. For example, Boq and Fiyero famously become the Tin Man and the Scarecrow, while the cub that Fiyero and Elphaba rescue as students grows up to be the Cowardly Lion. But what about Dorothy?",
      "In the stage musical, Dorothy is merely seen as a shadow throwing water on Elphaba in the film\u2019s finale. But \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d cast Bethany Weaver to play the part.",
      "Throughout the film, viewers can see Dorothy, her brunette pigtails and her blue plaid dress, but only from the back. Her face is never seen.",
      "That decision was easy, says Chu.",
      "\u201cThere was a mantra that we were taught when we first started this from the people who did the stage show, and they said, \u2018The key is it\u2019s about the girls, stupid.\u2019 ... That has guided our way the whole time,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to Dorothy and all these other characters, those are really fun things, but in movie language, if you see her face, you\u2019re going to want to know who she is, where she comes from, what does she want \u2014 and then the story takes a way left turn,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd this is \u2018about the girls, stupid.\u2019\u201d",
      "Glinda Formally Takes Over as a Leader of Oz",
      "After witnessing Fiyero\u2019s capture and Madame Morrible\u2019s cruelty, Glinda weighs whether to do something or stay complacent in the film\u2019s second brand new song, \u201cGirl in the Bubble.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart of deconstructing the fairy tale \u2014 which is sort of the point of \u2018Wicked,\u2019 to see this American fairytale in a new way, through a new perspective \u2014 part of that was understanding not just what what Elphaba was going through, but also what it means for somebody in a bubble of privilege when the truth is coming out,\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cAt what point does someone who doesn\u2019t have to be affected by this, what kind of courage does it take to actually pop your own bubble and engage and help somebody else? I think that that\u2019s such an important lesson in these days, that courage \u2014 no matter where you missed the moment \u2014 courage has no expiration date, and that we still have time to be the people who we see ourselves as,\u201d he adds.",
      "She ultimately chooses to go to Elphaba\u2019s side. The best friends briefly reconcile with \u201cFor Good\u201d before Elphaba fakes her own death. After escaping, Glinda returns to the Emerald City, forces the departure of the Wizard, arrests Madame Morrible and takes over as a leader of Oz.",
      "And in a slight expansion from the musical, we see exactly what she does with that newfound power: Free the animals.",
      "The Grimmerie Opens for Glinda",
      "Finally, the very end of \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d introduces a scene that is meant to spark discourse. As Elphaba and Fiyero escape to the Lands Beyond Oz, Glinda looks out over the Emerald City. The magic book, the Grimmerie, which Elphaba entrusted to her before her \u201cdeath,\u201d suddenly comes alive and opens beside Glinda.",
      "There are theories about what the Grimmerie\u2019s opening means, even among the cast and crew. Some think it represents Glinda finally having the potential to be a true witch, while others say it\u2019s a message from Elphaba to Glinda.",
      "\u201cWhat I think is great about this book of knowledge, the Grimmerie, I mean, it can be interpreted as many things,\u201d Chu says."

      "Like the musical, the story ends with Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) forced to separate after belting out Act II\u2019s signature song, \u201cFor Good.\u201d Glinda, watching shadows through a cracked door, sees Elphaba melt after Dorothy throws a pail of water at her. Glinda escapes on horseback, shrouded in a black cape. (Yes, Glinda was the mysterious figure we saw escaping a castle in the very first scene of the first \u201cWicked\u201d movie.) She goes on to assume power in Oz as she mourns her best friend\u2019s death.",
      "Only Elphaba isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s hiding in a trapdoor, waiting for her beloved Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) to meet her before they leave for the Land Beyond Oz together.",

      "But in \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d viewers see what happens to Glinda after she becomes Oz\u2019s leader. First, she officially declares the land welcome to all animals again.",
      "In the final scene, Glinda looks over the Emerald City as Elphaba and Fiyero trek through a desert to leave Oz. Elphaba looks back for a brief moment. Then Elphaba\u2019s book of spells, the Grimmerie, flutters to life before Glinda\u2019s eyes. Elphaba had given the book to Glinda before Elphaba\u2019s encounter with Dorothy.",
      "As established in the first film, the Grimmerie only opens for and can be read by a true witch, something that, as much as she tried \u2014  whether through begging Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) for sorcery lessons or twirling her practice wand \u2014 Glinda decidedly was not.",
      "So what does the Grimmerie opening mean?",
      "We asked the team behind \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d for their takes on the final scene. See what director Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey had to say.",

      "\u201cWhether (Glinda) finally gets to be who she\u2019s meant to be, that she\u2019s not reliant on this image in this mirror,\u201d Chu says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019 She says, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to be good.\u2019",
      "\u201cJust the effort of trying to be who we\u2019re supposed to be opens and unlocks our unlimited possibilities,\u201d he adds.",
      "The spontaneous opening of the Grimmerie could also relate to the film\u2019s theme of pursuing the truth amid propaganda. By the end of the film, Elphaba\u2019s reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West as told in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is upended by political lies told by the nonmagical Wizard of Oz and, as actor Michelle Yeoh says, the true wicked witch, Madame Morrible. But while viewers know the truth, in the world of the movie, Ozians do not, after Elphaba tells Glinda not to clear her name.",
      "\u201cIt could also be, Cynthia could be Jesus giving us, the humans, this Bible and saying, you know the truth, now what are you going to do with it?\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cI think it is a challenge to us as the audience, whereas maybe movie one was more of an answer. This is more a question and challenge for us to see how we\u2019re going to tell our story to the next generation,\u201d he adds.",
      "Erivo says Elphaba leaving the Grimmerie behind represents her entrusting it to Glinda.",
      "\u201cI think Elphaba\u2019s powers exist independent of the Grimmerie, and because she has certain powers, she\u2019s able to read the Grimmerie. It\u2019s like she and Grimmerie have an intrinsic relationship, and so the Grimmerie answers to her,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBut her leaving it behind and trusting it to Glinda essentially tells the Grimmerie, \u2018You\u2019re in new hands, trust this person,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Elphaba\u2019s lost her connection with the book. She says she believes Elphaba in fact can see the Grimmerie opening for Glinda.",
      "\u201cShe has visions, so I think she can see what happens, and she can feel it. And it opening means to her that, one, Glinda\u2019s made the right decision, and two, the Grimmerie trusts Glinda now, so everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says.",
      "But does Glinda know Elphaba is watching over her?",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba has something to do with it (opening), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba\u2019s alive,\u201d Erivo says.",
      "As for Goldblum, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, he is curious what leaving the Grimmerie behind means for Elphaba\u2019s powers. He also wonders: Why couldn\u2019t Elphaba trust Glinda with the knowledge that they survived?",
      "\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she trust that, \u2018Hey we\u2019re going to be OK, don\u2019t try to contact us ... Don\u2019t tell anybody that we faked it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cOr, is the loss that (Glinda) experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power. Her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she\u2019s ever had with Elphaba, does that trigger her ability to power?\u201d",
      "As for the opening of the Grimmerie, Goldblum says it\u2019s possible for Elphaba to \u201ctelepathically\u201d \u201ccommune\u201d with Glinda across space.",
      "\u201cDoes Glinda go, \u2018I don\u2019t think I did that. Are you out there somewhere. Are you OK?\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s meant to be ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Like Goldblum, Bailey believes there\u2019s a chance the opening of the Grimmerie was Elphaba sending Glinda a message.",
      "\u201cI think that the answers always lie in the Grimmerie, and I do think it\u2019s particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive for someone ... (with) the absolute knowledge that she has no magic and that she has no power,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see the Grimmerie come alive feels to me like a transference and a conversation between the two women.\u201d",
      "He believes this, even if it\u2019s not so literal of a conversation or message.",
      "\u201cAs we know with grief as well, those people do always exist in a different form, don\u2019t they? In a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together,\u201d he adds.",
      "Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote the screenplays for both films with writer Dana Fox, says the goal for the ending was to create a \u201cmystical moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith something mystical, it\u2019s not like the whole point is you know the answer, it\u2019s that it pulls something out of you, like a spiritual feeling,\u201d she says.",
      "One interpretation of the Grimmerie opening, Holzman says, has to do with the evolution of Glinda\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cShe was willing to let go ... of all the need to be admired in this empty way. And she was willing to be humble, to be a student, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know everything,\u2019\u201d Holzman says.",
      "Fox adds that the moment Glinda \u201cearns\u201d the Grimmerie opening is when she admits her \u201cdeepest shame\u201d to Elphaba: that she can\u2019t read the Grimmerie and perform spells.",
      "\u201cShe wanted so much to be that magical creature who could make magic happen, and she\u2019s going to end up being that, but it\u2019s going to take hard work,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cAnd to me, the Grimmerie opening is like the Grimmerie saying, \u2018OK, you\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "But the question remains: Does Elphaba know?",
      "\u201cI think the thing that really is up to interpretation that everyone should just talk about amongst themselves is, Does Elphaba know? Did she have anything to do with it? I think that is something that just everyone should decide for themselves,\u201d Fox says."

    "summary": "As the UN Climate Change Conference was happening in Brazil, the Trump administration released proposals to open up offshore drilling and roll back protections for wetlands and endangered animals.",
    "story": [
      "As representatives from nearly 200 nations were wrapping up talks at the United Nations\u2019 COP30 climate summit this week, the United States was not only absent, but the Trump administration also introduced a series of sweeping proposals to roll back environmental protections and encourage fossil fuel drilling.",
      "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended Friday in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, where delegates gathered to hammer out a road map to phase out fossil fuels, boost climate action and limit global warming.",
      "For the first time in the summit\u2019s history, the U.S. \u2014 one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 did not send a delegation. Instead, the Trump administration this week announced a plan to open up new oil drilling off the coasts of California and Florida for the first time in decades and proposed rule changes to weaken the Endangered Species Act and limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to protect wetlands and streams.",
      "\u201cThese rules double down on the administration\u2019s refusal to confront the climate crisis in a serious way and, in fact, move us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jessie Ritter, associate vice president of waters and coasts for the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.",
      "The White House told NBC News on Friday that this week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d announcements aim to \u201cfurther President Trump\u2019s American energy dominance agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is reversing government overreach, restoring energy security, and protecting American jobs by rolling back excessive, burdensome regulations and creating new opportunities to \u2018DRILL, BABY, DRILL,\u2019\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.\u201d",
      "Ritter said the new proposals signal to the world just how much the U.S. has stepped back from any meaningful climate action.",
      "\u201cI doubt that this surprises folks who have been watching in the international arena,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate, given the example the U.S. sets and what our leadership, or lack thereof, emboldens other countries to do.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it intends to open up roughly 1.27 billion acres of coastal U.S. waters for oil drilling drew bipartisan pushback.",
      "Although the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, hailed the program as a \u201chistoric step toward unleashing our nation\u2019s vast offshore resources,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., pushed to uphold the current moratorium on drilling, which Trump extended during his first term.",
      "\u201cI have been speaking to @SecretaryBurgum and made my expectations clear that this moratorium must remain in place, and that in any plan, Florida\u2019s coasts must remain off the table for oil drilling to protect Florida\u2019s tourism, environment, and military training opportunities,\u201d Scott wrote Thursday on X, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Across the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idiotic proposal to sell off California\u2019s coasts to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as our coastal economy and communities are put in danger,\u201d he said.",
      "The drilling directive came just three days after the Trump administration proposed major limits to the Clean Water Act of 1972 that would undo protections from pollution and runoff for most of the country\u2019s small streams and wetlands. The rule would narrow the definition of which bodies qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the act.",
      "If finalized, the changes would mean that the smallest share of freshwater resources would be under federal protection since the law was enacted, according to Jon Devine, who heads the water policy team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBy EPA\u2019s own estimate, only about 19% of the country\u2019s wetlands would be protected against unregulated destruction and development if this were finalized,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands act as buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water during extreme rainfall and other high-runoff events. As the world warms, coastal and inland flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe.",
      "\u201cMany of the places that we already have in the U.S. that are increasingly flood-prone due to climate change are going to be even more in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands and streams also feed into other bodies of water that serve as critical drinking water supplies across the country, so critics fear the policy could make drinking water unsafe in some communities.",
      "The third major environmental rollback announced this week was a set of four rules that would erode protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed changes aim to make it easier to remove species classified as threatened or endangered and harder to add new protected species and their habitats to the list. The rules, if passed, would also allow the government to consider \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d in decisions to list or delist species.",
      "Taken together, Ritter said, these three proposals are consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.",
      "\u201cThese decisions prioritize short-term gain, often for a few industries and special interests, at the expense of things that have been widely bipartisan and important issues for people for decades,\u201d Ritter said.",
      "The impacts of the changes might not all be apparent right away, she added, but the scale of the long-term consequences could be immense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly not an exaggeration that this is going to touch all Americans in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is connected, and it\u2019s hubris to think that we can have these massive negative effects on our streams and wetlands, our animals, our coastal waters, without impacts to humans.\u201d"

      "Dozens of young people wave their phone flashlights and sing along with a teen as she belts out lyrics and plays her keyboard outside a subway station.",
      "It\u2019s a scene that regularly plays out in cities around the world. But the singer in this widely shared video is now behind bars.",
      "Diana Loginova, the 18-year-old student and street musician, has emerged as an unlikely \u2014 and perhaps unwilling \u2014 voice of defiance in wartime Russia.",
      "Known by her stage name Naoko, the teen gained popularity over the summer with viral videos taken around St. Petersburg of her band Stoptime performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice.",
      "Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a \u201cmass simultaneous gathering of citizens\u201d during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening is what we call carousel arrests,\u201d Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. \u201cTheoretically, it can continue forever,\u201d he said. In practice, it could mean months in detention, and there is legal precedent for this, he added.",
      "\u201cIt looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,\u201d said Anisimov.",
      "Loginova\u2019s lawyer, Maria Zyryanova, told NBC News she wouldn\u2019t discuss the case while the singer is behind bars. Her current sentence expires Sunday.",
      "Naoko\u2019s case has been extensively covered by Russian state news agencies and exiled independent media, while supporters have spread leaflets calling for her freedom.",
      "In an interview published in August, months before her imprisonment, Naoko said she was \u201cscared\u201d to be detained but felt she \u201chad to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand that art is now the only language \u2014 at least in Russia \u2014 through which you can express your thoughts. I\u2019ve chosen it and don\u2019t want to speak any other,\u201d she told St. Petersburg news outlet Bumaga.",
      "Others have taken up that language in Loginova\u2019s absence.",
      "On a bench near the Kiyevskaya metro station in central Moscow, musician Vasily told NBC News that Naoko\u2019s case had \u201clit a fire\u201d in him, inspiring his own street performances as a way to support the jailed singer.",
      "\u201cHer freedom was taken away for her singing,\u201d said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. \u201cThat got me mad.\u201d",
      "Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.",
      "Inspired after seeing Naoko\u2019s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities\u2019 radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. \u201cWhen I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, \u2018Why do I berate people who keep silent and don\u2019t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?\u2019\u201d",
      "Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily \u2014 himself only 19. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.",
      "It was a song by Noize MC, who has openly spoken out against the war and Putin\u2019s regime, that Loginova performed before she first landed in jail.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics that appear to have gotten her in the most trouble appear innocuous on the surface: \u201cI want to watch a ballet, let the swans dance.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a reference to the failed 1991 coup attempt against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, during which state TV showed the \u201cSwan Lake\u201d ballet on a continuous loop. It has since come to symbolize something dangerous in Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 change.",
      "A video of the band\u2019s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of \u201ctraitors\u201d and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.",
      "A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper \u201cprefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case \u2014 primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.\u201d",
      "Monetochka, whose songs the band also performed, hailed them as \u201cheroes\u201d in a statement on social media, saying that Loginova was bringing \u201cmusic and freedom\u201d into the world rather than \u201cviolence and war.\u201d She did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the case.",
      "Kremlin critic Boris Nadezhdin, who was barred from running against Putin in last year\u2019s election, said he had been in communication with Loginova\u2019s mom, Irina, and was fundraising to cover the band\u2019s legal costs.",
      "He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people\u2019s emotional reactions were palpable. \u201cShe is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,\u201d said Nadezhdin.",
      "The people who came to listen to the band were also young, he added, a red flag for the Kremlin because of its predominantly older support base. \u201cSo they need to have an exemplary reprisal against some young singer,\u201d he said, \u201cso that others get fearful.\u201d",
      "While she garners sympathy at home and abroad, Loginova remains behind bars for her singing. Nadezhdin said he was not optimistic about her chances of performing again anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThey won\u2019t leave her alone quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI am telling them to get ready for a long ride ahead.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has spoken with the leaders of U.S. ally Japan and rival superpower China amid the pair\u2019s escalating dispute over Taiwan.",
      "Trump\u2019s surprise call Monday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was followed by a call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who angered China earlier this month with comments on the Beijing-claimed island democracy.",
      "Both China and Japan said Trump initiated the calls, which the White House has not confirmed.",
      "The dispute began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan\u2019s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.",
      "It was the first time such an explicit remark had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, which like the United States has long been deliberately vague as to whether it would intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.",
      "China, which describes Taiwan as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d has responded with outrage, taking the dispute to the United Nations, advising its citizens against traveling to Japan and seeking economic retaliation against Japanese seafood, movies, concerts and more.",
      "On Monday, China criticized Japan\u2019s plan to deploy missiles on an island near Taiwan as a deliberate attempt to \u201ccreate regional tension and provoke military confrontation,\u201d while Japan scrambled a fighter jet after it detected a Chinese drone flying between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.",
      "Though Takaichi has refused Beijing\u2019s demands that she retract her \u201cerroneous\u201d remarks, her government says Japan\u2019s policy on Taiwan has not changed and it continues to favor a peaceful resolution to the issue.",
      "Trump has not publicly commented on the dispute, though his ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has said Tokyo can count on U.S. support in the face of Chinese \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "Takaichi said Tuesday that she reaffirmed Japan\u2019s close cooperation with the U.S. in her call with Trump, which she said he initiated.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump mentioned that he and I are extremely good friends, and that I should call him any time,\u201d she told reporters, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during a visit to Japan last month, which was followed by a meeting with Xi in South Korea to address tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade and other issues.",
      "Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d call with Xi, their first since that meeting, and that U.S.-China relations were \u201cextremely strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNow we can set our sights on the big picture.\u201d",
      "Trump reaffirmed plans announced last month for him to visit Beijing in April, followed by a U.S. visit by Xi later in the year. He said he and Xi discussed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and the illicit international flow of fentanyl ingredients. Taiwan was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s post.",
      "That is good news for Taiwan amid growing pressure from China and questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to its security, suggesting that \u201cfrom the U.S.\u2019 perspective, there is nothing about Taiwan that has changed,\u201d said Lev Nachman, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.",
      "Xi also said the U.S. and China had \u201cgenerally maintained a steady and positive trajectory,\u201d according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the call was initiated by the U.S. side.",
      "Unlike Trump\u2019s post, the Chinese readout of the call heavily emphasized Taiwan, whose \u201creturn to China\u201d Xi said was an important part of the post-World War II international order.",
      "Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, was handed to the Republic of China government after Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945, only for that government to retreat to Taiwan a few years later after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday that for the 23 million people of Taiwan, there was \u201cno option of returning\u201d to China.",
      "\u201cWe must once again emphasize that the Republic of China is a fully sovereign and independent nation,\u201d he told reporters in Taipei, using Taiwan\u2019s formal name.",
      "The Trump-Xi call is a \u201cvery good signal\u201d that the strategic competition between the U.S. and China is under control, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China, though a \u201cdramatic breakthrough is hard to imagine.\u201d",
      "Taiwan has not been a major focus of U.S.-China relations in recent months, with Trump saying it \u201cnever came up\u201d during his meeting with Xi. The Chinese readout of their Oct. 30 meeting also failed to mention Taiwan, which is unusual.",
      "The Trump-Xi call comes after the U.S. announced two arms sales to Taiwan in the space of a week, the first since Trump returned to office in January. They include an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million and $330 million in fighter jet and other aircraft parts.",
      "China objects to such sales by the U.S., which has no official relations with Taiwan but is legally bound to provide the island with weapons for its defense.",
      "What China is seeking from Trump, Nachman said, is assurance that the U.S. is not going to loudly weigh in on the Taiwan dispute on Takaichi\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cFrom Beijing\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s important that other countries realize that there will be punishments for countries that take this pro-Taiwan stance,\u201d he said.",
      "The lack of comments from Trump on the issue, Nachman said, \u201ctells me that the U.S. has no desire to publicly make this about Taiwan more than it\u2019s already become.\u201d"

      "Ukraine and its allies welcomed progress Monday after high-stakes talks with the United States over the plan to end Russia\u2019s war, which Washington has pressured Kyiv to endorse by Thanksgiving.",
      "Meetings in Geneva produced an \u201cupdated and refined peace framework,\u201d Ukraine and the U.S. said in a joint statement that described \"meaningful progress\" from the \"highly productive\" talks.",
      "No specific details were released. European leaders expressed optimism but cautioned that \"major issues\" remained as Kyiv and its allies sought to navigate the U.S. ultimatum to accept the 28-point proposal they view as handing the Kremlin its key demands.",
      "Moscow continued to suggest it had been shut out of the discussions, and it was unclear whether any counterproposals from Ukraine would be acceptable to Russia.",
      "President Donald Trump also weighed in. \"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don\u2019t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,\" he said in a post on Truth Social early Monday.",
      "The Ukrainian delegation was on its way home to report back on the progress made, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. \u201cBased on these reports, we will determine the next steps and the timing,\u201d he added.",
      "Speaking earlier by video link at a summit in Sweden, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was working with partners \"to look for compromises that strengthen but not weaken us.\"",
      "He had warned Friday that his country faced perhaps its most difficult week yet, confronting the choice between its \u201cdignity\u201d and a \u201ckey partner.\u201d",
      "Trump injected greater tension as talks took place in Switzerland, accusing Kyiv of expressing \u201czero gratitude\u201d to the U.S. for its support throughout the conflict.",
      "Yet, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that \u201ca tremendous amount of progress\u201d had been made after the talks with Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy, attempting the balancing act of appeasing Trump and ensuring his nation's sovereignty while under fire at home for a corruption scandal, said that \u201cUkraine was grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and to President Trump personally.\u201d",
      "In a separate statement, Zelenskyy said there were \u201csignals President Trump\u2019s team is hearing us.\u201d",
      "Asked about the pressure on Ukraine to at least agree to a framework by Thanksgiving, Rubio said the U.S. wants to \u201cget this done\u201d as soon as possible. \u201cObviously, we\u2019d love it to be Thursday,\u201d he added.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that there are no plans for Zelenskyy to come to the White House \u201cat this moment in time\u201d but advised things can change quickly. She added that Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and the team in Geneva worked through the 28-point peace plan with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians over the weekend.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these points have been agreed upon. The Ukrainians have worked on language with us together, and you heard that from their delegation directly yesterday. So we feel as though we\u2019re in a very good place,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cOf course, we have to make sure that all of these points are agreed to. And then, of course, we\u2019re going to have to make sure the other party in this war, the Russians, agree to them, as well.\u201d",
      "But, while there were signs of progress, Europe remained wary as America's traditional allies scrambled to respond to the sudden emergence of a deal that could define the continent's security.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,\u201d Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on X.",
      "European Union leaders met to discuss the issue at a summit already taking place in Angola on Monday, as a counterproposal from major European powers circulated in the media.",
      "\u201cWhile work remains to be done, there is now a solid basis for moving forward,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement following the meeting.",
      "A German government spokesperson said Berlin saw the progress made in Geneva \u201cvery positively,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "The plan backed by Trump amounts to Ukraine's effective capitulation, ceding key territories to Russia while reducing its military in return for no major concessions from Moscow.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin wants legal recognition for what he has \u201cstolen,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday in reference to the plan\u2019s provision for the entire eastern Donbas region, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014, to be de facto recognized as Russian. \u201cTo break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, and that\u2019s the main problem,\u201d he added.",
      "U.S. allies and lawmakers have raised questions over who may have been behind the plan and how much Ukraine was consulted.",
      "Rubio insisted Sunday that the plan was authored by the U.S. after a bipartisan group of senators said he had told them that the text being discussed was a Russian initiative given to special envoy Witkoff.",
      "Moscow has maintained it has not officially been looped in to talks.",
      "During a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Monday, Putin said the plan, \"in the version we have reviewed,\" is consistent with discussions at his summer summit with Trump in Alaska, \"and, in principle, could form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" according to a Kremlin readout.",
      "Still, it\u2019s unclear if the Kremlin would agree to any modifications that would be necessary to get Ukraine and Europe to sign on.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it has not been updated on the progress of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. \u201cWe have, of course, been closely monitoring media reports that have been pouring in over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven\u2019t received anything official yet,\u201d he said.",

      "While President Donald Trump pushes for a quick resolution, the churning mud of the battlefield has produced only slow and painstaking gains for the Kremlin during the four years since its full-scale invasion.",
      "From the front-line city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk to Zaporizhzhia in the south and the northern region of Kharkiv, there is little doubt that Russia is making advances.",
      "President Vladimir Putin has urged Ukraine to surrender key territory at the negotiating table \u2014 as Washington has suggested \u2014 or face Moscow's military taking it by force anyway. Trump has echoed this sentiment, warning that Ukraine \"will lose in a short period of time\" if it does not agree to the deal he has backed.",
      "But battlefield monitors suggest the picture is not quite so bleak for Ukraine as Trump and Putin suggest.",
      "Russia's gains are slow and incremental, won at a heavy cost against Kyiv\u2019s overstretched army, according to these mostly Western observers, who see Moscow as overstating its position for diplomatic gain in negotiations with Washington.",
      "Pokrovsk, a transit hub that has been the center of the fighting for months, could soon hand the Kremlin its first major capture in two years.",
      "Yet, Russia would not be able to take the rest of Donetsk \"without significant casualties, probably in the hundreds of thousands,\" Chris Parry, a former NATO commander and rear admiral in the British Royal Navy, told NBC News in an interview. If Ukraine gives that up in a deal, it \"will leave the rest of the country vulnerable to a strike anytime that Putin wants to come back,\" he said.",
      "Indeed, since Aug. 15, Russia has has been advancing at \"foot pace,\u201d gaining just 3\u00bd square miles a day, according to an analysis Sunday by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.",
      "In all, Russia has occupied only an additional 1% of territory since November 2022, war-watchers agree. Most of the 20% of Ukraine that Russia controls is made up of land seized by Russian-backed fighters after 2014, and the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Assuming it can keep up even this crawl, Russia would not capture the rest of Donetsk until at least August 2027 \u201cand likely even longer,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War said. And Putin is pressuring Ukraine to hand over this territory, not because it truly is a fait accompli, but merely \u201cto save Russia significant amounts of time, effort, manpower, and resources,\" it said.",
      "On the flip side, not even Ukraine's most ardent supporters could claim that its position is easy. Could it survive the Russian advance if it wasn\u2019t coming under U.S. pressure to capitulate?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle of attrition, and both sides are paying a very high cost to defend or capture smaller and smaller areas.\u201d",
      "Pokrovsk is \u201con the verge of falling into Russian hands,\u201d said Horowitz, who follows the conflict in minutiae.",
      "That would allow Russian troops to turn their attention north to the \u201cfortress belt\u201d of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Kostyantynivka, a defensive line of cities that Kyiv has spent years reinforcing.",
      "Giving Donetsk to Russia would hand over these cities anyway.",
      "Ultimately, few Ukrainians believe this would be the end of the Kremlin\u2019s aggression. Rather, it would give Russia a potent foothold in the heart of the country, from which it might be able to add to its history of broken ceasefires and diplomatic promises.",
      "Ukrainian troops have for more than a year defended Pokrovsk. Now, most are pinned down in their positions, unable to move because of loitering Russian drones, and only resupplied by robotic tracked vehicles controlled remotely.",
      "Further northeast up the Donetsk front line, Russia claimed its forces had captured a string of villages, including Yampil.",
      "Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russia has likely captured 15 villages since September, the Black Bird Group, a Finnish open-source intelligence agency, told The Kyiv Independent on Sunday.",
      "Last week, both sides traded familiar claims and denials of Russian victory in Kupiansk, in the eastern Kharkiv region, which Russian commander Sergei Kuzovlev told Putin was a \u201ckey cog in Ukraine\u2019s defenses.\u201d",
      "As of last Thursday, the general staff of the Ukrainian military said it was still under its control, deriding Russian \"propaganda\" that was \u201csolely aimed at concealing the critical losses of the Russian army.\"",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield accounts from either side.",
      "Putin has used these claims of victory to threaten Ukraine and Europe.",

      "He was best known for songs including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"The Harder They Come,\" the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film's soundtrack was a major international success and helped spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",

      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Max Verstappen won the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Saturday night after capturing the lead from championship leader Lando Norris at the start and never looking back.",
      "The Formula 1 cars blasted down the Las Vegas Strip for 50 laps at breathtaking speeds of over 215 mph, delivering thrilling wheel-to-wheel racing under the bright lights for the third consecutive year.",
      "But in a stunning twist, both Norris and fellow McLaren driver Oscar Piastri were later disqualified in the middle of the night, hours after the race finish and podium celebrations, with officials finding illegal plank wear on their cars.",
      "Norris crossed the line in second place, ahead of title rival Piastri, who finished in fourth. Their disqualification carries huge implications for the world championship fight with just two more Grand Prix races and one \u201csprint\u201d left in the season.",
      "It puts Norris just 24 points ahead of both Piastri and four-time world champion Verstappen, who are tied on points in second place. Norris now has 390 points, while Piastri and Verstappen have 366.",
      "\u201cA frustrating end to today,\u201d Norris said in a statement. \u201cWe had to do some managing towards the end of the race and now we know it was due to some issues on our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified.\u201d",
      "Piastri called it \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d",
      "F1 rules require the wooden skid blocks under the cars to be at least 9 mm thick after a race in order to be deemed legal, a way to control ride height and contact with the ground. The penalty for failing to meet that standard is disqualification. It\u2019s rare, but not unheard of.",
      "McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said the breach was unintentional and apologized to Norris and Piastri \u201cfor the loss of points today, at a critical time in their Championship campaigns.\u201d He also apologized to McLaren partners and fans.",
      "\u201cWhile this outcome is extremely disappointing, we remain fully focused on the last two races of the season,\u201d Stella said.",
      "There are just two Grand Prix left in a 2025 season full of twists and turns \u2014 next weekend in Qatar and the weekend after in Abu Dhabi. The Qatar race features a shortened \u201csprint\u201d race, too, so there are a maximum of 58 points still up for grabs.",
      "\u201cThe upcoming weekends, we\u2019ll again try to win the race, and at the end of Abu Dhabi we\u2019ll see where we end up,\u201d Verstappen said of the title fight in a postrace interview ahead of the McLarens\u2019 disqualification.",
      "Norris started first but lost two positions in the opening corners after making an aggressive move to defend his lead, but ran wide on the first turn and got overtaken by Verstappen and George Russell. He eventually overtook Russell of Mercedes but couldn\u2019t get close to Verstappen, and he was forced to slow his pace toward the end due to a then-unknown issue with the car.",
      "Russell was promoted from third to second. Mercedes teammate Kimi Antonelli finished fifth but was moved up to third.",
      "\u201cI messed it up and made my life tougher into turn one,\u201d Norris said. \u201cBut even after that, we just weren\u2019t quick enough. ... I was pushing flat out and Max was still pulling away.\u201d",
      "Piastri fell a further six points behind Norris before the disqualification, but now they remain 24 points apart.",
      "An economic boost for Las Vegas",
      "Local leaders hope the race weekend will provide a much-needed economic boost to Las Vegas, which has struggled this year due to high costs and declining tourism, among other issues. Last year\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix delivered an economic impact of $934 million, according to one estimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important event. And I fully support all of our special events. We\u2019re not just the entertainment capital, we\u2019re the entertainment and sports capital,\u201d U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., who represents parts of the city, told NBC News ahead of the race. \u201cSo having a marquee event like this on the Las Vegas Strip is great, and it does a lot for our economy.\u201d",
      "F1 is looking to build on its momentum with American fans, having secured the races in Miami and Las Vegas \u2014 in addition to the long-standing Grand Prix in Austin \u2014 on the calendar for the long haul. It signed a five-year deal with Apple, which will take over the U.S. broadcast rights from ESPN starting next year.",
      "Celebrity sightings included musicians Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, actors Ben Affleck, Michael Douglas and Naomi Campbell, NBA All-Stars Magic Johnson and Jimmy Butler, and tennis player Taylor Fritz. Actor Catherine Zeta-Jones waved the checkered flag.",
      "The top three finishers were driven to the podium, which is located on the Strip at the Bellagio Fountain Club, in a pink LEGO-built Cadillac car driven by Terry Crews.",
      "Before the race, Ferrari superstar Lewis Hamilton took Beyonc\u00e9 on a hot lap around the circuit, a team spokesperson confirmed, as she was decked out in a Louis Vuitton custom racing suit. The two stars were spotted watching the race from the Ferrari garage.",
      "Also in attendance Saturday were Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel, who were given a tour of the paddock by F1 officials.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always kind of been a NASCAR fan and been learning a lot about F1 the last couple of years. And we\u2019re excited to see everybody race,\u201d Noem said, adding that she was getting a tour of the McLaren garage. Patel called Formula 1 \u201cone of the greatest sports,\u201d saying he\u2019s a McLaren fan.",
      "Rain brings chaos in qualifying",
      "The Friday qualifying session was thrown into chaos due to rain, which extracted every ounce of skill from the 20 drivers just to stay out of the barriers. The track, already known to have low grip even in dry conditions, was slippery and treacherous for most of the session.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to keep it on the track. Not crash. Not take yourself out,\u201d Norris said after taking pole position. \u201cOne day, I just hope \u2014 apart from having a two-seater F1 car \u2014 people can get that sensation of just how nerve-wracking and scary it can be at times. How unpredictable.\u201d",
      "And the Las Vegas paddock was abuzz with internal drama among several teams during the weekend.",
      "Piastri was asked about recently reposting an Instagram post that quoted F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone claiming McLaren \u201cprefers\u201d Norris because of his \u201chigh star quality\u201d and \u201cmarketing appeal.\u201d",
      "Asked about the repost, which was highlighted online by F1 content creators, Piastri told reporters it was an error.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said Friday after deleting it from his feed. \u201cI woke up this morning and saw it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe I accidentally did it. Obviously, it was not intentional. But yeah, I didn\u2019t know what had happened.\u201d",
      "Instagram has one-click reposts \u2014 unlike X, which requires users to click twice to confirm \u2014 making it easy to erroneously repost something while scrolling. Still, it added to a drama in which the Australian driver\u2019s fans have theorized that the British team favors his British teammate, a claim that McLaren firmly denies.",
      "Ferrari\u2019s two drivers downplayed recent comments by Ferrari chairperson John Elkann, who said they should \u201ctalk less and focus on driving\u201d \u2014 remarks slammed by critics as a gratuitous dig against Charles Leclerc and Hamilton after Ferrari\u2019s decision to build a new car for 2025 (rather than upgrade last year\u2019s version) backfired and led to a winless season so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always willing to do less media,\u201d Hamilton quipped.",
      "The seven-time world champion told reporters it\u2019s \u201cnot really\u201d possible to focus any more on driving than he already does. \u201cI wake up thinking about it. And I go to sleep thinking about it. And I think about it while I\u2019m sleeping,\u201d Hamilton said.",
      "Leclerc said the comment was a product of Elkann\u2019s ambition to maximize the team\u2019s potential. \u201cHe loves Ferrari. I love Ferrari. We all love Ferrari,\u201d Leclerc said. \u201cWhen he called me, he told me what were the intentions of these words, and that was very clear. It was a positive message, trying to be positive.\u201d",
      "Ferrari currently sits fourth in a close battle for second in the team championship, behind Mercedes and Red Bull. While the driver\u2019s title carries more glory, the constructors\u2019 championship is the one that awards cash prizes. Ferrari finished runner-up to McLaren last year in a close battle.",
      "While Hamilton said he takes no positives regarding his comeback from last place to a points finish, he enjoys racing in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cI love coming to Vegas,\u201d he told reporters after the race. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really great city. Always get a great welcome here. This is the biggest crowd I think we\u2019ve seen, even though it\u2019s quite cold.\u201d",
      "And the activities of the weekend have evolved over the three years as F1 seeks a better balance between sport and show.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s certainly better than it was a few years ago. I think that was a bit too much for everyone,\u201d Norris said. \u201cMay as well be in Cirque du Soleil with what we were doing back then.\u201d"

      "The 18-carat Jules Jurgensen watch, engraved and given to Straus for his 43rd birthday in 1888 \u2014 the same year he became a partner in New York\u2019s iconic department store Macy\u2019s \u2014 was recovered from his body after the ship sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912.",

      "Straus had been offered a seat on a lifeboat due to his age, but he insisted that other men go first. Ida Straus refused to leave his side. They were among the very few first-class passengers to perish in the disaster that claimed 1,500 lives.",

      "Two people were critically injured, two were seriously injured, and seven others were treated at the scene Thursday afternoon in the small community of Bella Coola, BC Emergency Health Services said in a statement.",
      "On Saturday, the BC Conservation Officer Service said the search for the bear expanded to include two additional grizzlies witnesses said were nearby during the incident.",
      "At a news conference Friday, Tamara Davidson, minister of environment and parks in the Canadian province, said that three children and one adult were seriously injured and remained hospitalized. Their relatives did not want to release the patients' latest conditions, she said.",
      "\"I want to recognize the teachers who took great risk to protect their students,\" Davidson said. \"Their actions deserve our greatest respect and gratitude. They were well prepared, and they are the true heroes.\"",

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel's military on Saturday launched airstrikes against Hamas militants in Gaza in the latest test of the ceasefire that began on Oct. 10. Health officials in Gaza reported at least 24 people killed and another 54 wounded, including children.",
      "\"The number is expected to rise as the airstrikes continue, and some of the wounded are in critical condition,\" Khalil al-Daqran, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The Israeli strikes came as international momentum was building on Gaza, with the U.N. Security Council on Monday approving the U.S. blueprint to secure and govern the territory. It authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Israel has previously carried out similar waves of strikes after reported attacks on its forces. At least 33 Palestinians were killed over a 12-hour period Wednesday and Thursday, mostly women and children, health officials said.",
      "One of Saturday's strikes targeted a vehicle, killing 11 and wounding over 20 Palestinians in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, said Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The majority of the wounded were children, director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said. Associated Press video showed children and others inspecting the blackened vehicle, whose top was blown off.",
      "Another strike targeting a house near Al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza killed at least three people and wounded 11 others, according to the hospital. It said a strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people including a child and wounded 16 others.",
      "And a strike targeting a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed three people, including a woman, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",

      "Israel's military in a statement said it launched attacks against Hamas after an \"armed terrorist\" crossed into an Israeli-held area and shot at troops in southern Gaza. It said no soldiers were hurt. The military said the person had used a road on which humanitarian aid enters the territory, and called it an \"extreme violation\" of the ceasefire.",
      "In separate statements, the military said soldiers killed five \"terrorists\" in the Rafah area, and two others after firing at four people who crossed into Israeli-held areas in northern Gaza and advanced toward soldiers in two separate incidents.",
      "The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage. Almost all of the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry says 69,733 Palestinians have been killed and 170,863 injured in Israel's retaliatory offensive. The toll has gone up during the ceasefire both from new Israeli strikes and from the recovery and identification of bodies of people killed earlier in the war.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts."

      "Ukraine must have a \u201cdecisive voice in peace talks,\u201d Polish President Karol Nawrocki said late Friday on X. \u201cThe price of peace cannot in any way be the achievement of strategic goals by the aggressor, and the aggressor was and remains the Russian Federation,\u201d he added.",
      "As European leaders mulled over the plan on the G20 summit\u2019s sidelines, notably absent was Trump, who is boycotting the event over his unfounded claims that South Africa\u2019s white minority is subject to hate crimes and land grabs.",
      "While Trump initially said Vice President JD Vance would attend, he later said there would be no U.S. delegation taking part. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an International Criminal Court warrant calling for his arrest, is also not attending.",
      "How much Europe will actually be able to influence the plan without U.S. involvement remains an open question, and one with implications for both Ukraine\u2019s borders and peace for the broader continent.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t influence this,\u201d said Bociurkiw. \u201cIt makes NATO and Europe look weak, and Putin will go on and on to cause more disruptions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a speed train and you have Putin and Trump on it, and then you have Zelenskyy on the departure platform and Europe stuck at the check-in counter,\u201d he added.",
      "Giles said the military aspects of the peace plan leave Ukraine effectively defenseless against a future Russian attack.",
      "\u201cAnd since Ukraine forms the front line of the defense of Europe, this is a potentially disastrous outcome for the continent as a whole,\u201d Giles said.",
      "Lawmakers in Ukraine aren\u2019t particularly happy with the plan either, with Victoria Podgorna from Zelenskyy\u2019s political party saying it was giving Russia \u201camnesty for launching a brutal war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Friday he had spoken with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his counterparts in Germany and France, adding that he would also talk to Washington to ensure Kyiv\u2019s \u201cprincipled stances are taken into account.\u201d",
      "\u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter,\u201d Zelenskyy said, warning his country of a \u201cvery difficult, eventful\u201d week ahead.",
      "His warning also came as Ukraine suffers setbacks on the battlefield and Zelenskyy tries to contain the fallout from a $100 million corruption scandal implicating his top officials.",
      "On Saturday, the Russian defense ministry said it had captured two additional villages in eastern Ukraine, one in the Donetsk region and another in Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Russia's gains, both on the battlefield and in the proposed plan, have drawn a positive response from the Kremlin, where Putin has said it could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though adding it was not \u201csubstantively\u201d discussed with Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, two people were killed in Russia\u2019s southern city of Syzran in a Ukrainian strike on energy facilities, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Fedorishchev, said Saturday on Russia\u2019s state-backed Max messenger app."

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has broken new ground in a country that struggles with gender equality. But she has quickly run up against a tradition that may be immovable.",
      "Trophies for sumo wrestling, Japan\u2019s national sport, are sometimes presented by the country\u2019s top leader \u2014 most recently in January, when Shigeru Ishiba, the prime minister at the time, awarded the winner\u2019s trophy at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But awkward questions arose ahead of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament, which concludes Sunday in the Japanese city of Fukuoka. Takaichi is prohibited from entering the ring according to the rules of sumo, which consider women impure.",
      "Takaichi will have a chance to sidestep the issue as the Japanese leader is expected to attend the G20 summit in South Africa this weekend amid a diplomatic spat with China.",
      "But the dilemma could resurface during the New Year\u2019s tournament in Tokyo.",
      "In Japan, sumo is not just a sport but a 1,500-year-old tradition that is held sacred in the nation of over 100 million people. It has deep roots in Shinto, Japan\u2019s Indigenous religion.",
      "Experts suggested Takaichi, a hard-line conservative elected last month whose policies are not seen as particularly pro-women, is likely to avoid the issue altogether so as not to challenge tradition, and send another high-ranking government official instead.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to upset her supporters or conservatives,\u201d said Hiromi Murakami, an expert on Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to even see a discussion around the topic,\u201d she said.",
      "Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, said last week that Takaichi \u201cholds the view that Japan\u2019s sumo culture is a traditional art form that should be cherished.\u201d",
      "She \u201cintends to respect the traditions of sumo culture,\u201d he later told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Reached for comment this week, the Japan Sumo Association said it had not received any request from Takaichi\u2019s office regarding her involvement. The association told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper this month, \u201cWe believe it is our mission to pass down the traditional culture of sumo.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time there have been questions as to whether a high-ranking female official would be allowed to enter the sumo ring, also known as the dohyo.",
      "In 1990, Mayumi Moriyama became Japan\u2019s first female chief Cabinet secretary, who often represents the government at sumo trophy ceremonies. The sumo association did not allow her to do so.",
      "The association rejected another request in 2000 by Japan\u2019s first female governor, Fusae Ohta, to enter the sumo ring at a tournament in the city of Osaka. She ultimately presented the trophy on a walkway next to the dohyo.",
      "In 2018, a female mayor, Tomoko Nakagawa of the city of Takarazuka, was denied a request to make a speech in the ring. That same year, the association apologized after two women were ordered out of the ring when they rushed to the aid of a mayor who had collapsed inside it.",
      "Such incidents underscore the challenges that continue to face women in Japan, which ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report.",
      "Sumo wrestling has also proved popular on the rare occasion a competition is held outside Japan. Last month, tickets sold out for the Grand Sumo Tournament at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, which hosted the event for the first time in 34 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting that they went to the U.K.,\u201d Murakami said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a female political leader who wants to give the trophy, what would happen then?\u201d",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jay Ganglani from Hong Kong."
