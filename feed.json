      "Harvey Weinstein is on trial again after an appeals court threw out the ex-studio-boss' 2020 rape conviction in a case that was a watershed for the #MeToo movement",
      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements began Wednesday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s rape retrial, five years after his original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful figures.",
      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",
      "\u201cThe defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\u201d Lucey said.",
      "The case is being retried because an appeals court threw out the landmark 2020 conviction.",
      "The retrial is happening at the same Manhattan courthouse as the first trial, and two accusers who testified then are expected to return.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first, which happened during the height of the #MeToo movement. Along with the charges being retried, he faces an additional allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t involved in the first case.",
      "The jury counts seven women and five men \u2014 unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 \u2014 and there's a different judge.",
      "The #MeToo movement, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has also evolved and ebbed.",
      "At the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, chants of \u201crapist\u201d could be heard from protesters outside.",
      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Prosecutors said that the woman, who hasn\u2019t been named publicly, came forward days before his first trial but wasn\u2019t part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version. At the same time, Weinstein has added several lawyers to his defense team \u2014 including Jennifer Bonjean, who is involved in appealing his 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. She helped Bill Cosby get his conviction overturned and defended R. Kelly in his sex crimes case.",
      "\u201cThis trial is not going to be all about #MeToo. It\u2019s going to be about the facts of what took place,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, said recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d",
      "But there has already been some talk of #MeToo. A prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.",
      "Others went further.",
      "A woman opined that \u201cnot enough has been done\u201d as a result of #MeToo. A man explained that he had negative feelings about it because his high school classmates had been falsely accused of sexual assault.",
      "Another man said he viewed #MeToo like other social movements: \u201cIt\u2019s a pendulum. It swings way one way, then way the other way, and then it settles.\u201d",
      "None of them is on the jury.",

      "The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal history and what it has taken to overcome it",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Board of Parole on Tuesday recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal record and what it has taken to overcome it. The board's action leaves the final decision on a pardon up to Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "The rapper-turned-country singer wants to be able to travel internationally to perform and share his message of redemption, after spending time behind bars as a young person.",
      "The board issued its nonbinding recommendation unanimously after a hearing that lasted about an hour and 45 minutes with several witnesses, including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall, advocating for the 40-year-old musician named Jason DeFord. One board member recused themselves from voting.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel\u201d and crossover songs like \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and earned four Grammy nominations, including for new artist of the year.",
      "\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d he said of the board's decision. \u201cI pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.\u201d",
      "His most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two other young men enter a house in 2002. Both of the others were carrying guns, although Jelly Roll was unarmed. They demanded money, and received $350 and a wallet with no money in it. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. He was sentenced to serve a year in prison and additional time on probation.",
      "Later, in 2008, police on patrol found both marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. He was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "He also has two misdemeanor offenses for driving without a license and possession of drug paraphernalia.",
      "Lee, a Republican, said every case seeking clemency, such as pardons, is equally important and goes through a thorough process.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on Jelly Roll, that\u2019s encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Jelly Roll told the board that while in a detention center, he fell in love with songwriting. \u201cIt started as a passion project that felt therapeutic and would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable and opened doors that I\u2019ve never thought possible.\u201d",
      "These days, he often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before performing concerts. He has bought restaurants out for the day to feed people who are homeless and played basketball with kids at a youth center the same day that he performed in Winnipeg. He said he generally doesn't seek out news coverage when he makes these visits.",
      "As a part of the pardon application, friends and civic leaders wrote to the board about Jelly Roll\u2019s transformation and generosity. Hall, who runs Nashville\u2019s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino also wrote in his favor, pointing out all the money he's given from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "One of the reasons Jelly Roll gave for needing a pardon is to be able to travel to Canada to perform, which his criminal record makes difficult. Currently, he would need to apply for a special permit that can include long wait times for a decision, according to a letter from an immigration attorney submitted with his clemency packet.",
      "\u201cI want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be \u2014 to let them know that change is truly possible,\" Jelly Roll told the board. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I\u2019m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "He said he would use the pardon for much more than going on tour, though.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll still be using this same pardon, God willing, to go do missionary work in my 50s and 60s,\u201d he said.",
      "Due to his criminal record, he told the board that every time he travels it \u201ctakes a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.\u201d He said he recently was able to make his first tour in Canada and took his first trip to the United Kingdom, where he spoke about a rehabilitation program.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks at least five years since his sentence expired.",
      "Lee has issued more than 90 pardons since taking office in 2019, all of them since 2021.",

      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements are set for Wednesday in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case.",
      "After a dayslong selection process yielded a seven-woman, five-man jury and five alternate jurors by Monday, prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers finished choosing a sixth and final alternate on Tuesday. Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can\u2019t see the trial through.",
      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d",
      "But in a reversal that dismayed #MeToo activists, New York\u2019s highest court last year overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence. The court found that the original trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony. That judge\u2019s term expired in 2022, and he is no longer on the bench.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Drawn from Manhattan\u2019s jury pool, the 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields.",
      "One has a high school equivalency degree. Others have master\u2019s degrees. Some have served as jurors or grand jurors multiple times before; others, never.",
      "Hundreds of other potential jurors were excused for reasons ranging from language barriers to strong opinions about Weinstein \u2014 \u201cthe first word that came in my head was \u2018pig,\u2019\u201d said one man who was soon let go.",
      "Those chosen were quizzed about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial about the highly publicized case.",
      "\u201cYou may hear sexual allegations here of a salacious nature \u2014 graphic, perhaps. Would hearing that indicate that \u2026 Mr. Weinstein must be guilty?\u201d defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.",
      "Prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about the #MeToo movement.",
      "\u201cIs there anyone who is going to think of the movement and think, \u2018OK, that\u2019s just something that I have to keep in the back of my mind when I\u2019m deciding this case\u2019? Everyone can put that aside?\u201d Lucey asked a group of 24 possible jurors. All indicated they could do so.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013, and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006. One of the two wasn\u2019t part of the original trial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is challenging a separate 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films.",
      "The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in.",
      "But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn't get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees.",
      "On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category.",
      "In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility.",
      "The regulation now reads: \u201cThe submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.\u201d",
      "Critics have long called on changes to the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That's left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars.",
      "Last year, for instance, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig.\u201d Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof's friend and countryman Jafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission.",
      "The rule change notably won't alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven't fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation's selection committees.",
      "The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools \u201cneither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.\u201d How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year's Oscar race, Brady Corbet's \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimately won best actor ) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress).",
      "\u201cThe academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\u201d the academy said Monday.",
      "The film academy also set down some rules for its new achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a \u201cbake-off\u201d presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees.",
      "Earlier in April, the academy announced a new category for stunt design, but that award won't begin until the 2028 Oscars.",
      "Next year's Academy Awards will be held March 15, 2026, with Conan O'Brien returning to host the ABC telecast.",

      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 \u201cAndor\u201d returns for its second season on Disney+ with a three-episode premiere Tuesday and the weight of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d galaxy seemingly on its shoulders.",
      "But creator Tony Gilroy says he and his collaborators felt little pressure from Disney and Lucasfilm as they sought to tell the story of a growing revolutionary resentment against the Galactic Empire and the birth of the Rebel Alliance leading up to the events of the 2016 film he scripted, \u201cRogue One.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe took no creative notes on this show,\u201d Gilroy, whose deep screenwriting resume also includes four films in the \u201cBourne\u201d franchise and 2007 Oscar nominee \u201cMichael Clayton,\" which he also directed. He told The Associated Press that \u201cI\u2019ve never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The latitude was astonishing.\u201d",
      "The forthcoming season, whose production was delayed by Hollywood's 2023 strikes, are coming with high expectations from fans who have been disappointed in other recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d TV offerings, with no new movies released in the franchise in six years.",
      "The new episodes trace how the spark lit in Diego Luna's Cassian Andor in the 2022 first season spreads through the galaxy. And they do it with characters and arcs rarely found in this realm before.",
      "\u201cThis second season, it\u2019s about all the layers, and the social and political climate that needs to happen for a revolution to erupt, for a rebellion to exist,\u201d Luna told the AP. \u201cThe universe of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 never stopped to tell the story of these regular people that becomes crucial for the history that we know.\u201d",
      "Gilroy drew inspiration from a broad range of historical and fictional sources.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ever going to get another chance to do another 1,500 pages on revolution again, with this much money and this much muscle, and everything else?\u201d he said.",
      "But as epic as the story is, its most essential moments are marked by intimate, one-on-one conversations.",
      "\u201cI start small,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI work teaspoon by teaspoon.\u201d",
      "That includes a season-opening scene that starts with Cassian giving a young imperial mechanic the courage to help him in a major heist. He sells her on the ecstatic feelings of destiny rebellion can bring.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite beautiful and idealistic also, like a revolution has to be, It\u2019s a great reminder of how romantic the idea of revolution is,\u201d Luna said.",
      "Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. They're never kept in the dark with the sort of script-rationing and secret-keeping that are the norm in major franchises.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in withholding information as power,\u201d said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. \u201cBefore I read episode one, I knew the end. It\u2019s just unheard-of.\u201d",
      "Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything \u201cStar Wars\u201d has shown before.",
      "Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise \u2014 no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it's not necessarily held as sacred.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen canon stretch so much,\" he said. \"It was really tight on \u2018Rogue.\u2019 But a lot of things have changed since then.\u201d",
      "The overall direction of the show was basically determined when work began on the series five years ago.",
      "\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing with Cassian,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI know that the first year is the making of a revolutionary and the road to Damascus, that\u2019s the first year, I know I\u2019m leading to Rogue, I know where he\u2019s gonna end up.\"",
      "Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O\u2019Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. They were discovered in the writing and in the performances.",
      "Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals \u2014 and dances \u2014 new to \u201cStar Wars\u201d that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had.",
      "\u201cAll I did for five years was just max out my imagination,\" Gilroy said.",
      "Mothma is among the \u201cRogue One\u201d characters who appeared in the first season and return for the second, along with Forest Whittaker's radical rebel Saw Gerrera, who this season gives a spine-tingling call to arms that is teased in the trailer: \u201cRevolution,\" he preaches to an underling, \"is not for the sane!\u201d",
      "Season 2 also sees the emergence of \u201cRogue One\u201d characters for the first time in the TV series, including Andor's droid sidekick K-250, played by Alan Tudyk, and Death Star builder Orson Krennic, played by Ben Mendelsohn.",
      "Luna took special pleasure in the return of Tudyk and his robot who speaks with no filter.",
      "\u201cI had so much fun playing with him, and having him back means a lot,\" he said.",
      "The three episodes dropping Tuesday gel to form what\u2019s basically a 2 1/2 hour movie, with Cassian stuck among rival rebel factions, Bix living in a farming community amid an imperial crackdown, and Mon Mothma having to play the patrician matriarch at her daughter's wedding, before all three are pulled in new directions.",
      "The entire series has been planned in those kinds of clusters.",
      "\u201cWe really think of it that we made eight movies in five years,\u201d Gilroy said.",

      "Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days. But Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners,\u201d led by twin Michael B. Jordans, proved a bloody exception to modern movie rules, launching with $45.6 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a Warner Bros. release that cost about $90 million to produce, was a bold gamble on originality \u2014 albeit with genre elements \u2014 and one of the most bankable American directors in Coogler. The \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director wrote and produced \u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release. That gave Warner Bros., after a handful of disappointments, an enviable one-two punch at the box office with one original, director-driven movie and one IP-based property.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release.",
      "Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, celebrated the two films\u2019 resonance with moviegoers. The studio accounted for a remarkable 64% of the domestic box office for the Easter weekend.",
      "\u201cMovies have the power to transport us to worlds only seen on the big screen, and Warner Bros. Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,\u201d Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday.",
      "But all eyes were on the performance on \u201cSinners,\u201d which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years \u2014 a virtually unheard of concession.",
      "But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d make up one of the industry\u2019s most potent director-actor duos. Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",
      "Before \u201cSinners,\u201d dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d (a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and \u201cMickey 17\u201d (a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons).",
      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences. Another would be Jordan Peele, whose \u201cNope\u201d (2022) debuted similarly with $44.3 million.",
      "Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d an animated tale of Jesus\u2019 life aimed at Christian audiences, capitalized on the Easter weekend, grossing $17.2 million in its second week of release. That was nearly equal to its opening weekend ($19.1 million), and brought \u201cThe King of Kings\u201d to a domestic total of $45.3 million.",
      "Bleecker Street\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d Andrew Ahn\u2019s reimagining of Ang Lee\u2019s 1993 queer comedy of errors, opened on 1,142 North American screens with $922,906 in ticket sales. \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, stars Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran and newcomer Han Gi-chan.",

Led by the sultry single \u201cBae,\u201d the nine-track album delves into romance and introspection.",
      "\u201cI feel resolved, both with the art and within about stepping back into the light. So, I think that resolve kind of had to be found before I felt confident enough to release the body of work and also unleash myself to the world again,\u201d explained Hilson, who said she\u2019s never stopped recording. \u201cThere were songs in my past that I felt were political moves, songs I didn\u2019t really love that I had to sing \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to feel like that this time around.\u201d",

      "Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself.",
      "The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music.",
      "During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats.",
      "\u201cThere were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,\u201d said Hilson, who shifted to acting.",
      "Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as \u201cnew media\u201d outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyonc\u00e9, who has never publicly commented on the situation.",
      "Hilson \u201ccan definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,\u201d said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. \u201cHer core fan base has matured \u2026 she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there\u2019s a lot of diversity and sound.\u201d",
      "Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity.",
      "There are quintessential \u201cMs. Keri Baby\u201d songs like the fun, Pop&B styled \u201cSomethin (Bout U),\u201d but there\u2019s also the introspective \u201cNaked (Love),\u201d and \u201cSay It,\u201d in which she expresses, \u201cI won\u2019t say I love you / \u2018til you say you love me.\u201d",

I prefer to be approached. \u2026 I prefer for the man to say \u2018I love you\u2019 first. I just prefer for a man to lead,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI\u2019m really a damsel \u2013 without the distress.\u201d",

      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,\u201d said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. \u201cThis reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.\u201d",
      "Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback \u2026 it feels more personal,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cThe other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.\u201d",
      "Hilson says she\u2019s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, \u201cFame: A Temptations Story,\u201d co-starring Keshia Chant\u00e9, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career.",
      "Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it.",
      "\u201cI just control what I can control \u2026 I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been away,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI feel unburdened \u2026 I\u2019m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein has been moved to a New York City hospital after a judge approved the ailing ex-studio boss\u2019s request to stay there rather than in jail when he\u2019s not in court for his #MeToo retrial.",
      "Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers lobbied for the move as jury selection got underway this week.",
      "They argued in court papers that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the Oscar-winning producer's health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court.",
      "Goetz\u2019s order will remain in effect at least until next Thursday, when he is set to hold a hearing to discuss the matter further.",
      "A different judge, Curtis Farber, is presiding over Weinstein's retrial. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. In all, 12 jurors and six alternates need to be seated.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again on rape and sexual assault charges after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Weinstein has been back and forth numerous times to Bellevue in recent months for treatment of various maladies. At a pretrial hearing in January, he railed against his treatment at Rikers, telling Farber he wanted to \u201cget out of this hellhole as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",

      "CHIBA, Japan -- The Force was with many Japanese, as well as visitors from abroad, at a \u201cStar Wars\u201d event on Friday where Lucasfilm announced that the next installation in the franchise will hit theaters in May 2027 starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "Appearing on stage before a lightsaber-waving crowd at Makuhari Messe center outside Tokyo, Gosling showed a photo of his childhood bedsheets, plastered with illustrations from the space epic created by George Lucas.",
      "\u201cI guess I was dreaming about \u2018 Star Wars \u2019 even before I saw the film,\u201d Gosling said.",
      "Shawn Levy, who will direct the movie, told the crowd that \u201cStar Wars: Starfighter\u201d will not be a prequel or a sequel, but a new standalone adventure with new characters set several years after \u201cEpisode Nine.\u201d Filming starts later this year, he said.",
      "Levy, who also directed the 2006 film \u201cThe Pink Panther\u201d and the recent Netflix series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d said little else, noting: \u201cI can\u2019t say much about it because I understand the rules.\u201d",
      "Only the title was shown on a giant screen, although that was enough for the crowd to burst into cheers.",
      "The event, called Star Wars Celebration, which runs through Sunday, is full of \"Star Wars\"-themed merchandise including T-shirts, toys, books, manga comics, AC chargers, cellphone covers, autographs, posters and more.",
      "The Lego booth featured a man wearing the ominous black mask and cloak of Darth Vader, made out of Legos. The deep-breathing villain also appeared as traditional Japanese lacquerware decorating earphones in a limited edition of 10, each selling for 990,000 yen ($7,000). Darth Vader T-shirts were more affordable at 8,000 yen ($56).",
      "\u201cIt makes me so happy to think everyone here loves \u2018Star Wars,\u2019\u201d said Yoshiki Takahashi, 26, who was holding a remote-controlled R2-D2 miniature robot.",
      "\u201cI love the directing, the sound of the gun and the lightsaber, but above all the story, with great fight scenes and, of course, human drama,\u201d he added.",
      "Another Japanese man, who said he goes only by Hiro, was dressed as the \u201cStar Wars\u201d character Mandalorian, in a detailed costume he made himself, complete with a plastic sword and armor.",
      "Also present were \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans from around the world, including a robed Raul Herrera, a computer science teacher from Chile, who was there with friends.",
      "\u201cAll of them,\u201d said Herrera, when asked which \u2018Star Wars\u2019 films he\u2019d seen. \u201cThe sense of commitment of the characters, I really like it.\u201d",
      "With offshoot stories spanning generations and literally the cosmos, \u201cStar Wars\u201d is one of the highest-grossing franchises of all time since its 1977 debut, starring Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker.",
      "It may be natural that \u201cStar Wars\u201d appeals to Japanese: Its story about a samurai-like hero who befriends various characters along his journey echoes the nation\u2019s fables, as well as legendary Akira Kurosawa films.",

      "Novavax says its closely watched COVID-19 vaccine is on track for full U.S. approval after additional discussions with the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Novavax's closely watched COVID-19 vaccine is on track for full approval after additional discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, the company said Wednesday.",
      "The news sent company shares soaring more than 21% in morning trading and appeared to resolve concerns that Trump administration officials might be holding up a decision on the shot.",
      "Novavax makes the nation\u2019s only traditional protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. It is still being sold under emergency use authorization \u2014 unlike mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "The FDA recently asked Novavax to develop a plan for collecting additional clinical data from those who have gotten the shot, the company said in a statement. It said it is \u201cengaging with the FDA expeditiously\u201d in hopes of receiving approval \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "At FDA, full vaccine approval is the gold standard. The agency was on track to sign off on Novavax\u2019s license by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "But FDA\u2019s acting commissioner, Dr. Sara Brenner, directed the agency\u2019s lead official overseeing the vaccine to pause the decision, according to one of the people. The delay, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sparked concerns of political interference under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who spent decades leading antivaccine groups before joining the federal government as health secretary.",
      "Last month, FDA\u2019s longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced out over disagreements with Kennedy about vaccine safety.",
      "With full FDA approval, Novavax would have permission to keep its shot on the market indefinitely. Products that receive emergency authorization can be removed by FDA after there is no longer a health emergency.",
      "All the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. train the body to fight the coronavirus by recognizing its outer coating, the spike protein.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna options deliver genetic instructions for the body to temporarily make copies of the protein. In contrast, the Novavax vaccine uses lab-grown copies of the spike protein packaged into nanoparticles and combined with an immune-revving ingredient. Protein-based vaccines have been used for years to prevent other diseases including hepatitis B and shingles.",
      "Each year, the three manufacturers update their vaccine recipes to better match the latest COVID-19 variants that are circulating, just like flu shots are updated yearly.",

    "story": [
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they are seeing and hearing increased worries about flying",
      "NEW YORK -- Adelynn Campbell\u2019s last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant.",
      "That was last year \u2014 before 67 people died in January when an American Airlines jet collided with a helicopter over Washington, D.C., in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "Now, Campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and it\u2019s making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be,\u201d said Campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in San Diego.",
      "Being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. As Mel Brooks once said: \u201cIf God wanted us to fly, He would have given us tickets.\u201d But for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help.",
      "Here's a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it.",
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they\u2019ve seen and heard increased worries \u2014 and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying.",
      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

      "Health officials in the Gaza Strip say more than 400 dialysis patients have died during the 18-month Israel-Hamas war because of lack of proper treatment",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Twice a week, Mohamed Attiya\u2019s wheelchair rattles over Gaza\u2019s scarred roads so he can visit the machine that is keeping him alive.",
      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says his agency will be providing Mexico a list to complete to stop the flow of sewage from Tijuana",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that Mexico must stop the flow of billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana that has polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water.",
      "Lee Zeldin made the demand during an Earth Day trip to the California-Mexico border, where he toured a plant in San Diego County that treats the sewage as a secondary facility and flew along the frontier to see the Tijuana River. He also was scheduled to meet with SEALs.",
      "Zeldin said that in the next day or so, his agency will present Mexico a to-do list of projects to resolve the decades-long environmental crisis, but he stopped short of specifying how the Trump administration would hold Mexico accountable if it does not act.",
      "The problem is \u201ctop of mind\u201d for President Donald Trump, Zeldin said, while adding that they have not talked about possibly imposing tariffs if nothing is done.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to know whether or not Mexico is going to do its part to resolve it, and then we\u2019ll go from there, as far as strategy and tactics,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources secretary, said her country also wants to resolve the problem. She met with Zeldin the previous evening and said they made progress in finding solutions.",
      "\u201cWe are here because we want to solve this,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said in a statement in Spanish. \u201cNot only so there is no untreated wastewater on Mexican beaches, but in the United States as well.\u201d",
      "The 120-mile (195 km)-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged and its population and industry have boomed, an increasing amount of toxins have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "The Navy is reviewing whether to relocate its training site for SEAL candidates after the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses of its recruits from 2019 to 2023.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020 more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin said. He added that he and Trump are hopeful that will change under the relatively new administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October.",
      "Zeldin said that after meeting with Mexico officials in San Diego for 90 minutes, he was left with the impression that Sheinbaum and her environmental secretary want to have a \u201cstrong collaborative relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being communicated by the new Mexican president is an intense desire to fully resolve this situation,\u201d Zeldin said. But he made clear that he wants Mexico to step up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we are going to stand before the people of California and ask them to have more patience and just bear with all of us as we go through the next 10 or 20 or 30 years of being stuck in 12 feet of raw sewage and not getting anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are all out of patience.\u201d",
      "Flanked by lawmakers from both parties, Zeldin noted that cleanup efforts have rare bipartisan support.",
      "Zeldin visited the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was built with funds from both countries to treat 25 million gallons per day as a secondary plant on the U.S. side.",
      "Mexico is working on several wastewater treatment projects to reduce the flow and make major upgrades to its existing plants. B\u00e1rcena said the now-repaired San Antonio de los Buenos plant, which went back to operating at full capacity this month, should make a difference.",
      "But Zeldin said Mexico must complete a number of other projects, including installing floodgates to collect trash in Tijuana. Another one being considered would divert 10 million gallons of sewage away from the shore.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Californians can now buy opioid reversal drugs directly from the state under a program aimed at making the life-saving medication less expensive and more accessible, officials said Monday.",
      "The state began selling its own generic version of Narcan last year for $24 per twin-pack to businesses and local governments, and will now also sell to individual consumers online. A box containing two doses of naloxone nasal spray costs between $45 and $70 from regular pharmacies and online marketplaces.",
      "Opioid overdose deaths, which are caused by heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone, have increased dramatically in California and across the country in recent years, reaching 7,847 in the state in 2023. But California officials say they have started to see a decline in these deaths.",
      "The move is part of a broader push by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to try to force drug companies to lower their prices by offering cheaper, competing versions of medication under the state's CalRx label.",
      "\u201cLife-saving medications shouldn\u2019t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all \u2014 not the privileged few,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Naloxone, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, has been available in the U.S. without a prescription since March of 2023, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Narcan, a nasal spray brand produced by the Maryland-based pharmaceutical company Emergent BioSolutions.",
      "California is also working on a plan to make insulin more affordable for residents. The state has an agreement with the nonprofit Civica to produce CalRx-branded insulin used to treat diabetes.",

      "Officials say Pakistan has launched a weeklong second nationwide vaccination campaign to protect 45 million children from polio",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan began Monday a weeklong second nationwide vaccination campaign aimed at protecting 45 million children from polio, officials said.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where the potentially fatal, paralyzing virus hasn\u2019t been stopped,",
      "Since January, Pakistan has reported only six polio cases. Last year, the South Asian country witnessed a surge in polio cases, which jumped to 74, though it reported only one polio case in 2021.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s Health Minister, Mustafa Kamal, has urged parents to cooperate with the medical staff, who visit door-to-door to vaccinate children.",
      "Health workers are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children.",
      "Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks.",

      "A woman in the southern African country of Namibia runs a program that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism",
      "WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Susan de Meyer's horses have different effects on different children. Hyperactive kids learn to be a little quieter around them while nonverbal children are moved to communicate and to bond with them.",
      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",
      "\"Some of them you see they are more open, they are happy. Some of them were very scared when they started with the horse riding but now they are very excited. When they hear we\u2019re going to the horses they are very excited and just want to go by themselves,\u201d Louw said.",
      "De Meyer said her program helps with fine-motor skills, gross-motor skills, muscle strengthening, coordination, balance and posture, all important for kids who struggle to sit at a desk at school and learn.",
      "One simple exercise de Meyer has children do when they ride is to let go of the reins and stretch their arms out straight and to the sides, using only their torso and lower body to balance as a groom leads the horse around the paddock.",
      "Some of the kids break out in smiles when they let go and look like they're soaring.",
      "\"We make the world different for these kids,\" de Meyer said.",

      "America\u2019s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep in as little as a few hours.",
      "Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They\u2019re joining a trend that has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible.",
      "Fast prescription delivery options are growing as traditional drugstores close and more people use telemedicine or subscription-based care that encourages regular deliveries.",
      "But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot to change people\u2019s behavior when it comes to their health care,\u201d said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester.",
      "Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association.",
      "CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023.",
      "Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours.",
      "Instacart got into prescription deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic when it started a partnership with Costco. The grocery delivery company has since launched same-day delivery partnerships with Wegmans and Publix.",
      "Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It\u2019s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds.",
      "Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,\u201d Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall.",
      "The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists.",
      "Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items.",
      "It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour.",
      "Customer demand drove Walmart\u2019s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company.",
      "Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window.",
      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",
      "McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has \u201cbig plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.\u201d",
      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",
      "Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries \u201cmaybe 10 years from now when I\u2019m not able to do it myself.\u201d",
      "The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions.",

      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans when trees, grass, and other pollens cause runny noses, itchy eyes, coughing and sneezing.",
      "Where you live, what you\u2019re allergic to and your lifestyle can make a big difference when it comes to the severity of your allergies. Experts say climate change is leading to longer and more intense allergy seasons, but also point out that treatments for seasonal allergies have become more effective over the last decade.",
      "Here are some tips from experts to keep allergy symptoms at bay \u2014 maybe even enough to allow you to enjoy the outdoors.",
      "The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues an annual ranking of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists.",
      "This year, the top five cities are: Wichita, Kansas; New Orleans; Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Memphis.",
      "There are three main types of pollen. Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.",
      "Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.",
      "Pollen trackers can help you decide when to go outside. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available at its website and via email.",
      "The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. Keep the windows in your car and your home closed, even when it\u2019s nice outside.",
      "If you go outside, wearing long sleeves can keep pollen off your skin to help ward off allergic reactions, said Dr. James Baker, an allergist at the University of Michigan. It also provides some sun protection, he added.",
      "When you get home, change your clothes and shower daily to ensure all the pollen is off of you \u2014 including your hair. If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",

      "The owner of a popular nightclub in the Dominican Republic whose roof collapsed and killed 232 people this month said it had filtration problems for decades and had been repeatedly fixed with plasterboard",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A roof that collapsed at a popular nightclub in the Dominican Republic and killed 232 people this month had filtration problems for decades and had been repeatedly fixed with plasterboard, according to its owner.",
      "Antonio Espaillat, who also serves as manager of the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, spoke with local TV station Telesistema on Wednesday in his first interview since the April 8 disaster.",
      "Espaillat told a reporter with El D\u00eda news program that employees had added new plasterboard to the roof hours before the collapse.",
      "He noted that plasterboard had fallen repeatedly throughout the years for reasons including water that filtered through the club\u2019s air conditioning units. However, Espaillat said no one ever inspected the roof or water filtrations.",
      "\u201cWe always bought plasterboard. Always,\u201d said Espaillat, who spoke in a subdued manner throughout the nearly one-hour interview.",
      "A spokeswoman for Espaillat did not return a message for comment seeking an interview with him.",
      "Espaillat said he learned about the collapse when his sister called him from underneath the debris, trapped along with hundreds of others attending a concert by beloved merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez, who was among those killed.",
      "\u201cTo the families of the victims, I want to say I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m very sorry,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cI am completely destroyed.\u201d",
      "Espaillat said he was 6 years old when his mother founded the legendary club 52 years ago. The club later moved to a space occupied by a shuttered movie theater and remained in that location for 30 years until the collapse.",
      "He said there were six air-conditioning units on the roof, plus three water tanks. An electric plant was installed in an adjacent room, not on the roof, he added.",
      "Every six to eight years, a specialized crew would waterproof the roof, with the last waterproofing done about a month before the collapse, he said.",
      "The heavy woofers that boomed music at Jet Set, known for its merengue parties held every Monday, were on the floor, he said.",
      "Espaillat said if there was something he could have done to avoid the collapse, he would have done it.",
      "\u201cThere was no warning, nothing. We were all surprised,\u201d he said.",
      "The Dominican government has created a committee that includes local and international experts tasked with investigating the collapse.",
      "About 515 people were at Jet Set when the roof fell on the crowd, according to Espaillat.",
      "In the 53 hours following the disaster, crews rescued 189 survivors. Dozens of others were hospitalized.",
      "The 232 victims include seven doctors; a retired U.N. official; former MLB players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera; and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi province and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz,",
      "At least three lawsuits have been filed.",
      "Espaillat, who said he usually attended Jet Set's Monday merengue parties, was in Las Vegas for a convention when his sister called.",
      "\u201cHow can a roof collapse?\u201d he recalled wondering as he flew back to the Dominican Republic.",
      "Espaillat said he did not immediately visit the site upon arriving because officials worried about his safety, noting that people at the scene were angry.",
      "He said he hasn\u2019t slept much since the disaster, and that he has talked to the families of his employees and some of the victim's relatives.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to face everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d",
      "The investigation into what caused the collapse could take a couple of months and has raised questions about the safety of infrastructure across Santo Domingo and beyond.",
      "There is currently no government agency tasked with inspecting the buildings of private businesses in the Dominican Republic, although President Luis Abinader announced last week that new legislation is expected to change that.",
      "Yamil Castillo, a structural engineer and vice president of the Society of Engineers of Puerto Rico, said water leaks can be extremely damaging and should be taken care of immediately.",

      "GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemalan authorities on Wednesday arrested an Indigenous leader of nationwide protests in 2023 that sought to ensure then President-elect Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s transition to power while also demanding the resignation of the country\u2019s attorney general.",

      "Attorney General Consuelo Porras has been the focus of much of that ire as she has refused to step down or halt her investigations into Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s party. The U.S. government has sanctioned her for allegedly impeding corruption investigations.",
      "Ar\u00e9valo said later Wednesday that the arrest was unfounded and \u201cspurious\u201d and \u201ccriminalizes principles and rights that are guaranteed.\u201d",

      "Pacheco, a member of the K\u2019iche\u2019 people, said at the time that the galvanizing moment for the community he represented was a raid on electoral offices broadcast live in which federal agents opened and took away \u2014 despite resistance from some electoral officials \u2014 boxes containing precinct vote tally sheets. \u201cThe people already voted and you have to respect the decision taken,\u201d he said then.",

      "LONDON -- European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s digital competition rules.",
      "The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store.",
      "The commission, which is the EU\u2019s executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrustcases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \u201cperiodic penalty payments,\u201d the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It\u2019s a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \u201cgatekeepers\u201d from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \u201cthat citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\u201d Henna Virkkunen, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\u201d Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "Apple accused the commission of \u201cunfairly targeting\u201d the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\u201d despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement that the \u201cCommission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards.\u201d",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \u201cnon-compliant\u201d conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\u201cDespite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "The EU\u2019s Meta investigation centered on the company\u2019s strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta\u2019s model, saying it doesn\u2019t allow users to exercise their right to \u201cfreely consent\u201d to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also including Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp, and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don\u2019t want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \u201ccurrently assessing\u201d this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" Kaplan said. \"And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\u201d",

      "BAGHDAD -- An official invitation to new Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to attend the upcoming Arab League summit in Baghdad has triggered sharp political divisions within Iraq.",
      "Al-Sharaa took power after leading a lightning rebel offensive that unseated his predecessor, Bashar Assad, in December. Since then, he has positioned himself as a statesman aiming to unite and rebuild his country after nearly 14 years of civil war, but his past as a Sunni Islamist militant has left many \u2014 including Shiite groups in Iraq \u2014 wary.",
      "Formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, al-Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling U.S. forces in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq.",
      "Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani confirmed last week that Iraq had extended a formal invitation to al-Sharaa to attend the May 17 summit, following a previously unannounced meeting between the two in Qatar. Al-Sharaa has not confirmed plans to attend.",
      "Iraq, which has strong ties with both the United States and Iran, has sought to position itself as a regional mediator. It hosted talks between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia before they reached a deal to normalize relations.",
      "Many Iraqi and regional stakeholders see the invitation to al-Sharaa as an opportunity to bolster Baghdad\u2019s image as a hub for regional diplomacy.",
      "However, strong opposition to al-Sharaa\u2019s invitation has emerged from powerful Shiite factions aligned with Iran. Tehran, which backed Assad in Syria\u2019s civil war and used Syria as a conduit to smuggle weapons to the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, was widely seen as the biggest loser from Assad\u2019s ouster.",
      "Several Iraqi Shiite militias fought alongside Assad's forces during the civil war that followed his brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011, making al-Sharaa a particularly sensitive figure for them.",
      "Mustafa Sand, a member of parliament from the Coordination Framework \u2014 a coalition of Iran-allied factions that brought al-Sudani to power in 2022 \u2014 said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the foreign ministry had reached out to Iraq\u2019s Supreme Judicial Council to verify whether an arrest warrant was issued against al-Sharaa and that the council had confirmed the existence of a valid warrant.",
      "A security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly confirmed the existence of the warrant to The Associated Press.",
      "The Islamic Dawa Party, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki \u2014 one of the most influential figures in Iraq\u2019s ruling coalition \u2014 called on the government in a statement to \u201censure that any summit participant has a clean judicial record, both locally and internationally,\u201d adding, \u201cThe blood of Iraqis is not cheap, and those who have violated their sanctity or committed documented crimes against them should not be welcomed in Baghdad.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the powerful militia Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali Al-Askari, said in a statement, \u201cArab summits have been held without President Assad, Iraq, or Libya. They certainly won\u2019t stop because the criminal Abu Mohammad al-Golani ... isn\u2019t attending.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Sunni political factions have rallied to defend al-Sharaa\u2019s inclusion in the summit. Former MP Dhafir Al-Ani, a prominent Sunni figure, said he supports Baghdad\u2019s attempts to build ties with the new Syrian authorities.",
      "\u201cPreventing his presence would be a stab in the heart of the Iraqi government and a sign that violence still dictates the country\u2019s fate,\u201d he said.",
      "The Iraqi government has not responded publicly to the backlash.",
      "A warrant would not necessarily block al-Sharaa from joining the summit. Other countries have chosen to waive similar measures. In December after Assad\u2019s fall, the United States said it had decided not to pursue a $10 million reward it had previously offered for al-Sharaa\u2019s capture, although Washington also has not yet officially recognized the new Syrian government.",
      "However, observers said the controversy highlights deep divisions within Iraq\u2019s political system and underscores the challenges facing national reconciliation efforts.",
      "\u201cSome see welcoming al-Sharaa as an insult to the memory of Iraq\u2019s victims, while Sunni factions view his participation as a political victory,\u201d said political analyst Munaf Al-Musawi, head of the Baghdad Center for Strategic Studies. \u201cThis could risk fueling sectarian tensions.\u201d",

      "Pope Francis had a learning curve on clergy sexual abuse, with the turning point coming in 2018",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Few could have predicted that a comment Pope Francis made during a 2018 visit to Chile would blow up into the biggest crisis of his papacy, and one that eventually set the Catholic Church on a new path of accountability for clergy sexual abuse.",
      "Francis was asked by a TV reporter about a Chilean bishop who had been accused by victims of having covered up the crimes of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile. Francis had been defending the bishop for years and shot back that there was \u201cnot one shred of proof against him. It\u2019s all slander. Is that clear?\u201d",
      "His irate response struck a nerve in Chile, which was just beginning to come to terms with a horrific legacy of clergy abuse, and it prompted Francis\u2019 top child protection adviser to sternly rebuke the pope for his harmful words.",
      "But then something remarkable happened: Rather than dig in, Francis commissioned an investigation, realized he was wrong, apologized to the victims he discredited, and got the entire Chilean hierarchy to offer to resign. It was one of the greatest midcourse corrections of the modern papacy.",
      "\u201cHe recognized his mistakes,\u201d said papal biographer Austen Ivereigh. \u201cHe learned from them. He said \u2018sorry.\u2019 And he put it right.\u201d",
      "When Francis was elected history\u2019s first Latin American pontiff in 2013, abuse survivors and their advocates initially questioned whether he \u201cgot it\u201d about abuse, because he freely admitted he had never handled cases of accused priests as archbishop of Buenos Aires.",
      "Francis did create a sex abuse commission early on to advise the church on best practices and placed a trusted official, Boston\u2019s Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, in charge. But the commission lost its influence after a few years and its crowning recommendation \u2014 the creation of a tribunal to judge bishops who covered up for predator priests \u2014 went nowhere.",
      "And then came Chile.",
      "During the now-infamous visit to Iquique, Chile, Francis was asked about Bishop Juan Barros, whom he had transferred to a southern diocese over the objections of the local faithful. Their complaint? Barros had been a priest under the sanctioned Rev. Fernando Karadima, and was accused by Karadima\u2019s victims of having witnessed and covered up the crimes.",
      "Francis had defended Barros because one of his friends and advisers, Chilean Cardinal Javier Errazuriz, also had defended the bishop.",
      "After being pressed on the plane home by journalists about his Barros defense, Francis commissioned an investigation into the Chilean church and realized he had been misled by Errazuriz and others.",
      "Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima\u2019s victims who received the pope\u2019s personal apology that year, later developed a personal friendship with the pontiff.",
      "\u201cHe sincerely wanted to do something and he transmitted that,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "Years later, Francis acknowledged 2018 was the turning point, or \u201cconversion,\u201d in his understanding about abuse, and he credited journalists, including The Associated Press, with enlightening him.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. You were the one on the plane who told me, \u2018No, that\u2019s not the way it is, Father,\u2019\u201d Francis told AP in a 2023 interview. Making a gesture that indicated his head had exploded, the pope continued: \u201cThat\u2019s when the bomb went off, when I saw the corruption of many bishops in this.\u201d",
      "By mid-2018, Francis had largely atoned for the Chile scandal. But then the next crisis hit.",
      "In July of that year, Francis removed once-influential American Cardinal Theodore McCarrick after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported that they had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults.",
      "It was apparently common knowledge in the U.S. and Vatican leadership that \u201cUncle Ted,\u201d as McCarrick was known, slept with seminarians, but he still rose steadily in the church's ranks.",
      "Having removed McCarrick and approved a canonical trial against him, Francis should have emerged as the hero in the saga since he righted the wrong of St. John Paul II, who had promoted McCarrick despite his reputation.",
      "But Francis\u2019 get-tough victory lap was cut short when a former Vatican ambassador to the U.S. accused the pope himself of participating in the McCarrick cover-up.",
      "In an 11-page denunciation in August 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano claimed he had told Francis in 2013, at the start of his pontificate, that McCarrick had \u201ccorrupted a generation\u201d of seminarians and priests and that Pope Benedict XVI had eventually sanctioned McCarrick for his sexual misconduct. Vigano claimed Francis disregarded his 2013 warning and rehabilitated McCarrick. He called on Francis to resign.",
      "Francis didn\u2019t initially respond. But he authorized a two-year investigation into McCarrick, finding that bishops, cardinals and popes over three decades played down or dismissed multiple reports of sexual misconduct against him. The report largely spared Francis and instead found that Vigano had failed in monitoring McCarrick while he was U.S. ambassador.",
      "McCarrick died earlier this month; Francis excommunicated Vigano last year for schism.",
      "The crisis prompted Francis to take even bolder action to hold the hierarchy accountable for covering up abuse. In 2019, he summoned the heads of bishops' conferences from around the world to the Vatican to impress on them the need to act to prevent abuse and punish offending priests.",
      "He changed church law to remove the \u201cpontifical secret\u201d covering abuse cases and passed a law requiring church personnel to report allegations in-house, although not to police. He approved procedures to investigate bishops who abused or covered up for their pedophile priests, seeking to end the tradition of impunity for the hierarchy.",
      "Ivereigh, the papal biographer, said those reforms were the result of Francis\u2019 learning curve on abuse.",
      "\u201cI think he understood that at the root of the sex abuse crisis was a culture and a mindset which he constantly called clericalism, a sense of entitlement, and which led not only to ultimately to abuse of power and sexual abuse, but its cover up,\u201d Ivereigh said.",
      "But questions continued to dog Francis even after the scandal passed.",
      "One case that haunted him for years was that of Argentine Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta, who was accused, and eventually convicted, in an Argentine court of abusing his seminarians. Francis had created a job for Zanchetta at the Vatican after he had been accused of misconduct, spiriting him out of Argentina for purported \u201chealth\u201d reasons.",
      "Francis never responded to questions about the Rev. Julio Grassi, who was Argentina\u2019s most notorious clerical sexual abuser. While Francis was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he commissioned a study into Grassi\u2019s conviction that concluded he was innocent, that his victims were lying, and that the case never should have gone to trial. Argentina\u2019s supreme court upheld the conviction.",
      "\u201cBefore Pope Francis can enact accountability for bishops and other church leaders, he has to own up to the harm he himself caused victims in Argentina,\u201d said Anne Barrett Doyle of the online resource Bishop Accountability, which pressed Francis to get even tougher about abuse and cover-ups throughout his pontificate.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of people are filing through the central aisle of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to pay their final respects to Pope Francis",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Thousands of people filed through the central aisle of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to pay their final respects to Pope Francis on Wednesday, the start of three days of public viewing ahead of the pontiff's funeral.",
      "Throngs of ordinary faithful made their way slowly to the 16th-century basilica's main altar, where Francis' simple wooden casket was perched on a slight ramp, as four Swiss Guards stood at attention. Over the coming days, tens of thousands of people are expected to pass through the basilica, which is staying open until midnight to accommodate them.",
      "Cardinals, meanwhile, met in private to finalize preparations for Saturday's funeral and plan the conclave to elect Francis' successor.",
      "Francis died on Monday at age 88, capping a 12-year pontificate characterized by his concern for the poor and message of inclusion, but also some criticism from conservatives who sometimes felt alienated by his progressive bent.",
      "Wednesday opened with the bells of St. Peter\u2019s tolling as pallbearers carried Francis' body from the Vatican hotel where he lived into the basilica in a procession through the same piazza where he had delivered what became his final goodbye. Francis made a surprise popemobile tour through the faithful on Easter Sunday, after being assured by his nurse he could despite his continued frail health from a bout of pneumonia.",
      "Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican temporarily until a new pope is elected, led the procession down the central aisle to the altar, with clouds of incense preceding him and the choir chanting the Litany of Saints hymn. In pairs, cardinals in red cassocks approached the casket, bowed and made a sign of the cross, followed by small groups of purple-robbed bishops, black-clad ushers, priests and nuns \u2014 and then the doors were thrown open to the public.",
      "Heads of state are expected for Francis' funeral, but the three days of public viewing in the basilica allow ordinary Catholics to grieve the Argentine pope. The viewing ends Friday at 7 p.m., after which Francis' casket will be closed and sealed.",
      "Francis' death and funeral inaugurates a carefully orchestrated period of transition in the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic Church, with cardinals gathering over the coming days before entering into a conclave, the secretive ritual voting in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. There are 135 cardinals under age 80 and eligible to vote, and the new pontiff will likely come from within their ranks. The conclave is not expected to begin before May 5.",
      "South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, who heads the Vatican's office for priests, predicted a short conclave, but acknowledged the transition is full of uncertainties.",
      "\u201cWe'll see what the Holy Spirit says,\u201d he said Wednesday. Asked if the next pope could come from Asia, where the Catholic Church is growing, he insisted: \u201cFor the Lord, there's no East or West.\u201d",
      "Papua New Guinea\u2019s first and only cardinal, John Ribat, prepared Wednesday to leave for Rome to participate in the vote, pleased to represent the poor South Pacific island nation of 12 million people and more than 800 languages in a College of Cardinals that Francis greatly diversified over 12 years.",
      "\u201cThe important thing is that \u2026 Papua New Guinea is part of the church, the global church. And to be able to have a representative from here to be in the conclave, it is a big thing,\u201d Ribart told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he hoped the next pope would be someone who could lead the church in \u201ca way that is truthful and binds everyone together.\u201d",
      "Francis first lay in state in the Domus Santa Marta hotel in a private viewing for Vatican residents and the papal household. Images released by the Vatican on Tuesday showed the pope in an open casket, wearing the traditional pointed headdress of bishops and red robes, his hands folded over a rosary. The Vatican\u2019s No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, was pictured praying by Francis.",
      "Once inside the basilica, Francis' casket wasn't put on an elevated bier \u2014 as was the case with past popes \u2014 but placed on a ramp, facing the pews. It was in keeping with Francis' wishes for all the rituals surrounding a papal funeral to be simplified to reflect his belief that the pope's role is that of simple pastor, not world leader.",
      "\u201cFor me, Pope Francis represents a great pastor, as well as a great friend to all of us,\u2019\u2019 said Micale Sales, visiting St. Peter\u2019s Basilica from Brazil.",
      "Italian police have tightened security for the viewing and the funeral, carrying out foot and horse patrols around the Vatican, where pilgrims continued to arrive for the Holy Year celebrations that Francis opened in December. The faithful who walk through St. Peter\u2019s Holy Door during such years are granted indulgences, a way to help atone for sins.",
      "\u201cI think he spread a positive message around the world, saying there shouldn\u2019t be any violence, there should be peace around the world,\u2019\u2019 said Amit Kukreja, from Australia.",
      "The funeral has been set for Saturday at 10 a.m. in St. Peter\u2019s Square, and will be attended by leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Cardinals are continuing their meetings this week to plan the conclave and make other decisions about running the Catholic Church.",
      "History\u2019s first Latin American pontiff charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated many conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.",
      "Francis had some reservations about his final popemobile tour through St. Peter\u2019s Square on Easter, Vatican News reported on Tuesday. But he overcame them, the news agency said, and was thankful that he had greeted the crowd. He died the next morning.",
      "\u201cThe death of a pope is not a small thing, because we\u2019ve lost our leader,\u2019\u2019 Julio Henrique from Brazil said just outside the basilica. \u201cBut still, in a few days, we will have a new leader. So \u2026 the thing of hope remains. Who will assume Peter\u2019s throne?\u201d",

      "As church bells tolled against a brilliant blue sky, mourners gathered and wept quietly as they paid respects to Agust\u00edn Escobar, Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal and their three young children, all of whom were killed on April 11 when a helicopter broke apart midair and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey.",
      "\u201cWe have been in pain for the last 11 days, but they will always remain in our memories and remind us from up high to never lose our ability to smile,\" said the woman's father, Joan Camprub\u00ed, during the funeral service.",
      "He thanked those who attended, which included Catalonia's regional leader Salvador Illa and Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni, and shared memories of his daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren.

      "A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices have started proceedings to determine whether federal officers, retired military officers and an aide of former President Jair Bolsonaro will also stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup",
      "SAO PAULO -- A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices started proceedings on Tuesday morning to determine whether federal officers, retired military officers and an aide of former President Jair Bolsonaro will also stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup.",
      "Last month, the panel unanimously accepted charges against Bolsonaro and seven close allies over an alleged attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and ordered him to stand trial.",
      "When Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup, he divided them into five different groups, based on their roles and positions in the alleged plot.",
      "Bolsonaro and his closest allies, including running mate Gen. Braga Netto, were placed in the \u201ccore group,\u201d according to the charges. Now, the Supreme Court panel will review charges against the second group, which Gonet said held managerial roles.",
      "The second group includes former presidential foreign affairs adviser Filipe Martins, retired Gen. Mario Fernandes, former Federal Highway Police director Silvinei Vasques, former presidential aide Col. Marcelo C\u00e2mara and two federal police officers, Fernando Oliveira and Marilia Alencar.",
      "These individuals coordinated actions planned by the core group, Gonet said in the indictment. These included mobilizing police officers to support the alleged coup, monitoring authorities and drafting a document intended to justify a state of exemption in the country.",
      "If a majority votes in favor, the accused will become defendants in a criminal case.",
      "Bolsonaro and his allies have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. The former president says that he\u2019s being politically persecuted. He has been hospitalized for more than a week, recovering from bowel surgery. On Monday, from his hospital bed in Brasilia, he gave an interview to local television network SBT and said that his trial wasn't technical, but political.",
      "Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but when combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars. The former president is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court.",

      "The international police agency Interpol says that police raids have rescued 33 West Africans from a human trafficking ring in Ivory Coast that lured people into paying fees and providing coerced labor by promising them jobs in Canada",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Police raids have rescued 33 West Africans from a human trafficking ring in Ivory Coast that lured people into paying fees and providing coerced labor by promising them jobs in Canada, the international police agency Interpol said Tuesday.",
      "Victims paid as much as $9,000 to supposed recruiters who instead trafficked them to the city of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, where they were held under physical and psychological coercion, the agency said in a statement.",
      "They also were forced to help scam others with the same promise of finding a job abroad by taking photos of themselves in upscale restaurants and hotels and posting them online as though they were in Canada. The traffickers allowed them limited contact with their families to maintain the illusion of living overseas.",
      "The initial raids on two of the locations associated with the trafficking ring were conducted in February in a joint operation between Ivory Coast and Ghana, where some of the victims were from.",
      "The scheme first came to light when the father of two victims came forward to Ghanaian authorities. Victims were from Benin, Burkina Faso, Togo and Ghana.",
      "Youssouf Kouyate, director general of the Ivory Coast National Police, commended the \u201cclose cooperation\u201d with Ghanaian police and Interpol, as well as \u201cthe bravery of the victims who came forward to assist in this investigation.\u201d",
      "After the 33 victims were freed, they were referred to a nongovernmental organization for assessment, the Interpol statement said.",
      "Scams of this type are increasingly common in West Africa and police forces across the region have conducted mass raids in the past including the arrest of over 300 people in 2024.",
      "Interpol, which has 196 member countries, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime.",

      "Greece\u2019s prime minister has announced 1 billion euros in financial benefits for lower-income households and the country\u2019s public investment program",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greece\u2019s prime minister on Tuesday announced 1 billion euros ($1.15 billion) in financial benefits for lower-income households and the public investment program, after the country became one of the few European Union members to post a budget surplus in 2024.",
      "Only six of the EU\u2019s 27 member nations posted a surplus for 2024, figures released by Eurostat showed. Greece\u2019s surplus of 1.3% of gross domestic product \u2014 compared to an overall EU deficit of 3.2% \u2014 was a marked improvement in financial performance for a country that was deeply mired in a debt crisis that roiled the EU and international financial markets about a decade ago.",
      "The figures \u201crecord a significant overperformance by the national economy and a surplus in state coffers. Which means that, with everyone\u2019s help, we did much better than we expected,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address to the nation.",
      "\u201cDynamic growth, along with the fight against tax evasion and a series of other reform measures, brought additional revenue, even above the targets we had set,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cSo despite the strict European fiscal rules, a significant portion of them can now be returned to citizens.\u201d",
      "In order to tackle housing problems, renters will have the cost of one month\u2019s rent returned to them each November, starting this year, Mitsotakis said, while 250 euros (nearly $290) per year will be given at the end of each November to older, disabled and uninsured people.",
      "Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said that the rent returns will be allocated to households according to annual income levels, and will apply to 948,000 households, or about 80% of renters in Greece, while the 250-euro benefit will apply to a total of 1.4 million people.",
      "An additional 500 million euros ($575 million) per year will be paid into the country\u2019s Public Investment Program to speed up public infrastructure and social projects \u201cand, amidst international instability, to increase investments so that new jobs continue to be created,\u201d he added.",
      "Greece\u2019s fiscal performance has been steadily improving since it began emerging a few years ago from a nearly decade-long financial crisis which saw it lose access to borrowing on the international bond market, leaving it dependent on successive international bailouts. Unemployment skyrocketed as the country saw a quarter of its economy wiped out.",

      "Walter Frankenstein, who survived the Holocaust by hiding in Berlin with his wife and infant children, has died",
      "BERLIN -- Walter Frankenstein, who survived the Holocaust by hiding in Berlin with his wife and infant children and spent his later years educating young people to keep the events alive in memory, has died. He was 100.",
      "Klaus Hillenbrand, a close friend who wrote a book about Frankenstein, confirmed the death on Tuesday. He said Frankenstein died on Monday. The foundation that oversees Berlin's Holocaust memorial also confirmed that he died Monday in Stockholm.",
      "Frankenstein was born in 1924 in Flatow in what is now Poland but was then part of Germany. Three years after the Nazis came to power, in 1936, he was no longer allowed to attend the town\u2019s public school because he was Jewish.",
      "With the help of an uncle, his mother sent him to Berlin where he could continue his school education, and he later trained as a bricklayer at the Jewish community\u2019s vocational school. He stayed at the Jewish Auerbach\u2019sche Orphanage where he met Leonie Rosner, who would later become his wife.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, Frankenstein described how he witnessed Kristallnacht \u2014 the \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d on November 9, 1938, when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Up to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps.",
      "Frankenstein, who was then 14, climbed on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.",
      "\u201cThen we knew: the synagogues were burning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\u201d",
      "Starting in 1941, Frankenstein had to do forced labor in Berlin, repeatedly threatened by the danger of being deported by the Nazis.",
      "In 1943, five weeks after their son Peter-Uri was born, he went into hiding with his wife, Leonie, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.",
      "\u201cWe had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\u201d Frankenstein told the AP. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201d",
      "Together with their baby, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run. They stayed with friends or in bombed-out buildings.",
      "Up to 7,000 Berlin Jews had gone into hiding, but only 1,700 of them were able to survive. The others were either arrested, died of illness or perished in air raids.",
      "In 1945, when Berlin was liberated by the Soviet Red Army, Frankenstein\u2019s children were among the youngest of a total of only 25 Jewish children who had survived in Berlin.",
      "Before the Holocaust, Berlin had the biggest Jewish community in Germany. In 1933, the year the Nazis came to power, around 160,500 Jews lived in Berlin. By the end of World War II in 1945 their numbers had diminished to about 7,000 through emigration and extermination.",
      "All in all, some 6 million European Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.",
      "After the collapse of the Nazis\u2019 Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then Palestine and later became Israel. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved to Sweden, where they settled for good.",
      "Later in life, Walter Frankenstein returned to Germany several times a year. He often talked to schoolchildren about his life and in 2014, he received Germany\u2019s highest honor, the Order of Merit.",
      "He was also an ardent fan of the Hertha Berlin soccer club. As a teenager he went to its games, and when Jews were no longer allowed to visit the stadium he would listen to reports of matches on the radio. In 2018, Frankenstein became an honorary member of the club with the membership number 1924, his year of birth.",
      "Every time Frankenstein traveled to Berlin in his later years, he brought along the small blue case containing the Order of Merit. Inside the case\u2019s lid, he had attached the first \u201cmark\u201d he got from the Germans: the yellow badge, or Jewish star, that he had to wear during the Nazi reign to identify him as a Jew.",
      "\u201cThe first one marked me, the second one honored me,\u201d he said.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday found the U.S. government liable to the state of North Dakota for more than $28 million in the state's lawsuit for recouping millions of dollars for policing the protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A federal judge on Wednesday found the state of North Dakota entitled to nearly $28 million for responding to protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 a win for the state in its multiyear effort to recoup the costs from the federal government.",
      "The state filed the lawsuit in 2019, seeking $38 million for policing the protests. The sometimes-chaotic demonstrations drew international attention for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline\u2019s Missouri River crossing upstream of the tribe\u2019s reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline, fearing an oil spill polluting its water supply.",
      "A trial played out over several weeks in early 2024 in federal court in Bismarck, the state capital. People who testified included former North Dakota governors Doug Burgum, who took office in December 2016 during the protests\u2019 height, and Jack Dalrymple, whose administration responded to the protests\u2019 early months.",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor found the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers liable to the state on all claims and for more than $27.8 million in damages.",
      "The judge wrote: \u201cThe bottom line: United States had a mandatory procedure, it did not follow that procedure, and harm occurred to the state of North Dakota. The law allows reimbursement for this harm. More than that, the rule of law requires this Court to hold the United States liable to remind it of its role in the larger picture of ensuring peace, not chaos.\u201d",
      "Thousands of people camped and demonstrated against the pipeline near the crossing for months. Hundreds of arrests resulted. Sometimes-violent clashes occurred between protesters and law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers from around the state and region responded to the protests.",
      "\u201cIt was a violent, unlawful protest. And \u2018protest\u2019 is a gentle word,\u201d North Dakota Attorney Drew Wrigley said last year before trial.",
      "The protest camps were cleared in February 2017. An attorney for the state said the protests ended in a response of more than seven months involving 178 agencies, resulting in 761 arrests and requiring four days of cleanup of the camp to remove millions of pounds of trash.",
      "\u201cAlthough the unlawful protest was burgeoning before everyone's eyes and the damages and dangers were so apparent, the federal government refused to offer assistance and enforce the legal obligations on the people who were encamped,\" Wrigley said.",
      "Attorneys for the government said at trial that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials \u201cacted reasonably given limited options at their disposal\u201d during the protests, and that the state's claim is \u201cgreatly overstated.\" The government asked the judge to find a lack of legal jurisdiction for the state's claims, that the state hasn't proven its claims and is not entitled to damages.",
      "The pipeline has been transporting oil since June 2017. Many state government officials and industry leaders support the pipeline as crucial infrastructure in the country\u2019s No. 3 oil-producing state. The pipeline carries roughly 5% of the United States' daily oil production.",
      "In 2017, the pipeline company, Energy Transfer, donated $15 million to help cover the response costs. That same year, the U.S. Justice Department gave a $10 million grant to the state for reimbursing the response. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how that amount affected the damages.",
      "Then-President Donald Trump denied a 2017 request from the state for the federal government to cover the costs through a disaster declaration.",
      "The pipeline is operating while a court-ordered environmental review of the river crossing is carried out.",
      "A North Dakota jury recently found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims brought by the pipeline's builder in connection with protest activities, with damages surpassing $660 million for three Greenpeace organizations.",

      "France favors a system where the islands would be jointly managed by the two countries, but the U.K.'s decision last year to hand over control of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius has spurred some in Madagascar to push for full control of the Scattered Islands \u2014 which are known as the Eparses Islands in France.",
      "Madagascar and France \u201care determined to find a solution together,\u201d Rajoelina said.",

      "The agency shuffled through three acting directors over the course of a week. It\u2019s preparing to lose tens of thousands of workers to layoffs and voluntary retirements. And President Donald Trump is weighing in on which nonprofits should lose their tax-exempt status, an incursion into the agency\u2019s typically apolitical stance that threatens to further erode trust in federal institutions and weaponize enforcement efforts.",
      "Just three months into Trump's second term, the government's fly-under-the-radar tax collector has become the latest platform for the Republican administration\u2019s vision to cut and control the federal bureaucracy. Tax policy experts fear that taxpayer services and collection efforts will face prolonged delays as a result of the rapid changes.",
      "The quick turnover in leadership and other changes are likely to dampen employee morale at the IRS and hurt the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers in a timely manner, says Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cLeadership sets the tone, particularly in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Already, she notes, the agency has lost decades of institutional knowledge from nonpartisan career civil servants who have left over policy disagreements and layoffs.",
      "The upheaval unfolded as Americans dutifully filed their taxes ahead of the April 15 deadline and as a legion of IRS employees undertook work to process returns and dole out refunds. The latest filing season data shows the agency accepted more than 117 million returns this tax season and issued $228.7 billion in refunds.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to improving the efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service,\" said the agency's newest acting commissioner, Michael Faulkender. \"For the last 35 years, we\u2019ve been five years away from the IRS being modernized. Under the direct leadership of Treasury, the modernization will be done in two years at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",

      "Douglas O'Donnell, the Trump administration's first acting IRS commissioner, announced his retirement in February as furor spread over DOGE gaining access to IRS taxpayer data. Melanie Krause, the second acting commissioner, resigned early this month over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Gary Shapley, an IRS whistleblower who testified publicly about investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes, was acting commissioner for a matter of days before being replaced by Faulkender, who was elevated just last week. The New York Times reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had complained to Trump that Shapley had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Trump's nominee for IRS commissioner, former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, is still waiting for a confirmation hearing but faces controversies of his own. Most recently, Senate Democrats have called for a criminal investigation into Long's connections to alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. Long did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.",
      "Among other concerns at the agency are fears that Trump will weaponize the IRS against his enemies \u2014 and reward his friends.",
      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political institutions, including fundraising platform ActBlue and the protest group Indivisible, are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",

      "Among other changes in recent weeks are concerns about the IRS' engagement with the Department of Homeland Security over enforcing a new data-sharing agreement signed earlier this month by Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

      "SHANGHAI -- Leading automakers are showcasing their latest designed-for-China and the world models at the Shanghai auto show this week, fighting not to be edged aside in the world\u2019s largest car market while watching for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s next steps in his trade war.",
      "This year's show in the sprawling industrial outskirts of Shanghai comes at a pivotal moment. Three decades after Beijing set out to build a world-class auto industry, local manufacturers account for about two-thirds of sales inside China, and a growing share of global exports.",
      "But with U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and the European Union slapping duties on Chinese electric vehicles, selling to some overseas markets is growing increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cGeopolitics are very complex and the situation remains uncertain,\u201d Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motors, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut Great Wall is always exploring investments in overseas markets.\u201d",
      "The exhibition is holding two media days and two trade days before it opens to the public on Sunday. It runs until May 2.",
      "Encouraged by government subsidies for scrapping older cars for the latest models, Chinese drivers have embraced the switch to electrics, with sales of battery powered and hybrid vehicles jumping 40% last year.",
      "A total of 31.4 million vehicles including buses and trucks were sold last year in the world\u2019s biggest market by sales, up 4.5% compared to a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported.",
      "Growth in sales of EVs was offset by falling sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, which still accounted for just over half of new car sales.",
      "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD nudged past Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of EVs by sales last year, reporting revenue of over $100 billion. It recently announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about the time needed to fill up at the pump. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "To gain access to China's potentially huge market, foreign automakers like Volkswagen, General Motors, BMW and Ford set up joint ventures with state-owned local companies beginning in the 1980s and '90s, helping them build the capacity and technology to compete on a world scale.",
      "They also created sprawling supply chains in Shanghai and other major manufacturing hubs, helping to nurture other big names in Chinese automaking, such as BYD, Geely and Great Wall Motors.",
      "With growth at home limited by brutal competition, they're expanding rapidly especially in Southeast Asia and other developing economies with relatively affordable sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks.",
      "Shanghai\u2019s auto show is a gathering for the \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d said Zhou Lijun, director and chief researcher of the industry analysis group Yiche Research Institute.",
      "That doesn't mean all the EV makers go it alone. BYD teamed up with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group, to launch its Denza premium brand. It's also challenging Toyota and other top tier brands with its luxury Yangwang brand, priced at up to 2 million yuan ($280,000)",
      "Opening markets wider to foreign competition has given car buyers a choice of more affordable, innovative vehicles. That's a mixed blessing for older automakers like GM, Ford, Toyota and VW that are also fighting a battle of attrition in China.",
      "\u201cChina is still a market worth fighting for,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the BMW Group, which like other automakers highlighted a \u201cIn China, for China,\u201d approach, at \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "Overhanging the upbeat talk in Shanghai by both Chinese and foreign automakers of manufacturing in China for the world are Trump's tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, despite a 90-day pause that has spared many other countries, and 25% U.S. tax on imported cars and auto parts.",
      "Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s head of China operations, Stephen Ma, said the company plans to make 10 new battery electric or hybrid models by 2027 in China, for China and for \u201cexport to the world, except one country \u2014 you can guess which one.\"",
      "Higher U.S. and European tariffs on foreign-made EVs are prompting Chinese newcomers to shift production closer to those markets as more Western consumers opt for the latest Chinese models.",
      "Just a few decades ago, Nissan, Toyota and other Japanese automakers were fighting trade friction with the United States over their own exports. Now, they employ hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers at their U.S. factories.",
      "\u201cThe trade war between China and the United States has blocked direct exports from China to the United States, but it hasn't blocked local production there or the establishment of global production bases in Europe or elsewhere,\" Zhou said.",
      "A report by the Rhodium Group shows that nearly half the world's markets are restricting imports from China, in part because of national security concerns linked to the advanced electronics in EVs and other high-tech vehicles. A minority of countries like Australia and South Africa remain relatively open, and Russia is a major market but is nearly saturated, it says.",
      "Chinese automakers lag behind global leaders like Toyota in conventional gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles, but they can sell EVs at roughly the same price, while also solving the problems of range and fast charging.",
      "China has become part of what geopolitical analyst Yanmei Xie described as a \u201ctechnological paradigm shift\u201d in a commentary in the Japanese financial publication Nikkei Asia. Automakers in China are going electric not just because of the green transition, but as a route to \u201ctechnological and industrial dominance,\u201d she wrote.",

      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports has revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport",
      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports, prompted by the deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the potential for a collision between air tour helicopters and planes at Harry Reid International Airport led the agency to make immediate changes to flying rules. In the first three weeks after implementation the number of collision alerts for planes dropped 30%.",
      "The FAA said after the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January, which killed 67 people, that it planned to use artificial intelligence to dig into the millions of reports it collects to assess other places with busy helicopter traffic, including Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The FAA\u2019s acting administrator, Chris Rocheleau, said Las Vegas quickly became a concern once the agency dug into the data because agreements with helicopter operators there didn\u2019t clearly define vertical and lateral separation requirements when helicopters were approaching the airport. And air traffic controllers in the tower weren\u2019t issuing traffic advisories between returning helicopters and airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe took quick action including exercising positive control over the helicopters and issuing more traffic advisories to pilots,\u201d Rocheleau said. He promised to take additional actions in Las Vegas and at other airports where the FAA identifies concerns.",
      "Luke Nimmo, a spokesperson for Clark County Department of Aviation, referred all questions about the findings to the FAA.",
      "Following the crash of a New York City sightseeing helicopter into the Hudson River that killed six people April 10, the FAA said it was establishing a rulemaking committee to develop recommendations for improving commercial air tour safety.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former National Transportation Safety Board and FAA accident investigator, said the fact that collision alerts for planes dropped so quickly \u201cindicates a real hazard existed before the FAA looked at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough to characterize how significant the hazard was,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet another hole in the Swiss cheese that can line up with other holes and cause an accident just like what happened in Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "He said it made sense that the FAA first addressed the Las Vegas airport, given its large mix of helicopters and commercial traffic.",
      "\u201cI think that they will find issues at other airports, but maybe not to the degree that they found with this one,\u201d Guzzetti added.",
      "Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said there have long been safety issues with the helicopter tour industry, describing it as slipping in many cases into \u201cbecoming an attraction rather than a safe ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately in aviation, it is accidents that bring the attention of the regulators to their responsibilities,\" he added.",
      "The January midair collision near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport was the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since 2001. A series of other crashes and near misses in the months since have raised worries about air travel, even though it remains safe overall.",
      "Helicopters have been a key concern, but Rocheleau said the core safety issues remain operations and maintenance problems. He said the top causes of helicopter accidents include loss of control and striking an object during low-altitude operations.",
      "The FAA said its review of the safety data has expanded beyond helicopters to look at airports with a mix of many different planes and airports that are close together.",
      "The proximity between Hollywood Burbank Airport and Van Nuys Airport in the Los Angeles area emerged as a concern because they are less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. Both airports serve a wide mix of aircraft and have arrival and departure paths that are close.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hollywood Burbank Airport referred questions to the FAA. The Van Nuys Airport didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "\u201cWhile flying remains the safest mode of transportation, we must always strive to do better,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cWe have to identify trends and get smarter about how we use data. And when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them.\u201d",
      "Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents several families of victims of the D.C. plane crash, praised the FAA for taking action to make helicopter flights safer.",
      "\u201cAs a frequent critic of the FAA, I must say that the FAA deserves recognition for taking these steps to protect the traveling public,\" he said. \"Helicopters are known for being the most dangerous and potentially unsafe aircraft. The extra vigilance by the FAA may save many lives.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the uncertainty they have created",
      "WASHINGTON -- The outlooks for the U.S. and global economies have significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.",
      "The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.",
      "U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.",
      "The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. \u201cThis global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.\u201d",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",
      "Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties.",
      "Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didn\u2019t substantially change the IMF\u2019s forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth.",
      "China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of U.S. tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.",
      "While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a \u201csupply shock,\u201d similar to what hampered during the pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall.",
      "Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.",
      "The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.",
      "The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMF\u2019s January forecast.",
      "Japan\u2019s growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.",

    "story": [
      "Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear",
      "Bottles and bags, food wrappers and straws. Piping, packaging, toys and trays. Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear.",
      "A typical closet is loaded with plastic, woven into polyester activewear, acrylic sweaters, nylon swimsuits and stretchy socks \u2014 and it\u2019s shedding into the environment nonstop.",
      "When garments are worn, washed and put through the dryer, they shed plastic fiber fragments. A single load of laundry can release millions that are so tiny wastewater treatment plants can\u2019t capture them all. They wind up in local waterways that connect to the ocean. Marine animals eat them, and that can pass plastic to larger animals and humans.",
      "Even natural fabrics shed fibers and have chemicals that can leach into the environment. But polyester is the most widely used fiber on Earth, and along with other synthetic fibers accounts for about two-thirds of production worldwide.",
      "Tuesday is Earth Day, when people worldwide contemplate ways to reduce their impact on the planet.",
      "\u201cEveryone who wears and launders clothing is part of this problem but everyone who wears and launders clothing can be part of the solutions,\u201d said Rachael Z. Miller, founder of Vermont-based Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean.",
      "Simple changes like washing clothes less and using cold water instead of hot can help reduce the shedding of fibers. More challenging is that textiles need to be produced and used in a more sustainable way, said Elisa Tonda at the UN Environment Programme. For example, designing clothes that shed fewer microfibers and are high-quality to last longer, said Tonda, who leads the resources and markets branch.",
      "The easiest solution is to wash clothes less often, making for less of the friction that breaks fibers apart, said Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy.",
      "\u201cThey get tumbled and tossed around with a bunch of soaps, really designed to shake things up to get out dirt and stains,\u201d Brandon said.",
      "Miller uses a stain stick to spot-clean. Both say that when clothes are washed, they shed less when put in cold water in full loads to reduce friction, on a shorter cycle, then hung to dry.",
      "Inspired by the way coral filters the ocean, Miller invented the Cora Ball, a laundry ball that can be tossed into the washer to cut down on clothes banging into each other. It also catches microfibers. (A portion of the proceeds goes to the Rozalia Project.) Another option is to put synthetic fabrics in a washing bag that captures fibers.",
      "Which clothes shed the most? To find out, press a strip of clear packing tape to a garment, then stick it to white paper to check for fibers, Miller said. Garments that are loosely knit or woven tend to shed more, such as fleece.",
      "Miller said people don't need to rush to throw out clothing that's more likely to shed. She owns fleece jackets herself. Instead, she suggested such clothing can be worn indoors only or outside with a layer on top, and it's worth thinking twice about acquiring more garments like that.",
      "\u201cI try not to guilt or panic people because a lot of this information is very new,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd so we might as well just say, \u2018OK, I got it. How can I be strategic about what I\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d",
      "Filters can be added to washers to capture microfibers. Samsung Electronics collaborated with Patagonia and the global conservation organization Ocean Wise to launch one in 2023. It's now sold in more than 20 countries for front-load washers. Bosch recently launched a microfiber filter in Europe for washers.",
      "France was first to adopt a law to mandate that new washing machines sold in the country have a microfiber filter, though implementation has been delayed.",
      "In the U.S., efforts to mandate filters in states have failed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill in 2023, saying he was concerned about the cost to consumers and he wants to incentivize, not mandate, technologies to remove microfibers in wastewater. In Oregon, state Sen. Deb Patterson proposed a bill this year requiring microfiber filters on new washers sold in that state after she came across the technology in Canada. Patterson said the bill doesn't have enough support yet but she'll keep trying.",
      "The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers opposes the proposals, saying it's concerned about consumer costs and filter effectiveness.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's Republican-dominated Senate voted 33-8 on Monday to kick the Republican treasurer out of office over a $1.8 billion accounting error.",
      "It will now be up to the House, also dominated by the GOP, to decide whether to hold its own hearing. If at least two-thirds of its members vote against Treasurer Curtis Loftis, he will be removed from office.",
      "Monday's extraordinary hearing was the culmination of over two years of investigation by the Senate that began when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion.",
      "That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn't balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousands of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grew to $1.8 billion.",
      "It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the money was not real cash but just an accumulation of errors.",
      "Two Republican senators led the call for Loftis to be kicked out of office, saying he can no longer be trusted to handle South Carolina's bank accounts. They charged that he is incompetent and never reported the mistakes to lawmakers as required by law while refusing to take accountability.",
      "\u201cHe's a liar that was so concerned with his public appearance that he would do and say anything to cover up his mistake,\u201d Sen. Stephen Goldfinch said.",
      "Senators followed the presentation with their own questions. Most of the eight senators asked Loftis directly why he didn't take responsibility for the error and why he let others inform the Senate. Loftis said that was the responsibility of other officials.",
      "\u201cIt's everybody but me. And maybe that's so, but it is so hard to defend ... in a \u2018can he do the job' (sense),\" Republican Sen. Luke Rankin told Loftis. \u201cHelp me, help us. Accept the responsibility.\"",
      "\u201cWould you tell me what you want me to take responsibility for, because it is complicated,\u201d Loftis replied.",
      "Loftis has called the Senate investigation a witch hunt. He repeatedly said no money went missing and the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state's strong credit rating.",
      "Loftis' lawyers opened the treasurer's case with a photo of Loftis and Republican President Donald Trump. They compared the hearing to coups in Zimbabwe and Myanmar that threw out elected officials and said Loftis' real judges should be the voters in the Republican primary in 14 months. Loftis said he is now running for reelection after testifying to senators this would be his last term.",
      "Fellow lawyer Johnny Gasser reminded the 34 Republicans in the 46-member Senate that nearly every vote cast for them also was a vote for Loftis.",
      "\u201cDo you really want to go down this path?\u201d Gasser asked.",
      "Eight Republicans voted against removing Loftis, with the rest of the Senate finding Loftis committed \u201cwillful neglect of duty.\" They sent the matter to the House, which must also hold its own two-thirds vote to remove the treasurer.",
      "No office holder has been removed in this way since South Carolina became a state 235 years ago.",
      "Republican leaders in the House have not indicated whether they will take up the matter.",
      "The state's books still haven't been fully straightened out, and accountants continue to struggle with Loftis' office and how they handle bank accounts, Sen. Larry Grooms said.",
      "The treasurer is trying anything to protect his 14 years in office and reputation as a competent conservative steward who is always looking out for taxpayers, Grooms said.",
      "\u201cBecause of his failures, the self-proclaimed best friend of the taxpayer is costing the taxpayers tens of millions in legal, auditing and oversight fees,\u201d Grooms said. \u201cWith friends like this, who needs tax-and-spend liberals.\u201d",
      "Lofits, without going into details, said he knew his actions fell short of expectations at times. He promised to do a better job in the future as he spoke for about 10 minutes on Monday from a temporary lectern in the back of their chamber",
      "He said the times he misspoke or slammed papers or accused senators of a witch hunt were just his passion for fighting an injustice.",
      "\u201cI hope all of us in this room agree that we should rise above the moment and return our focus to what matters \u2014 serving the people of South Carolina with honor, respect and purpose,\u201d Loftis said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Stores selling secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from President Donald Trump'strade war even as businesses the world over race to avert potential damage, according to industry experts.",
      "American styles carry international influence, but nearly all of the clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab last week estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods, noting U.S. tariffs \"disproportionately affect\u201d those goods.",
      "Such price hikes may drive cost-conscious shoppers to online resale sites, consignment boutiques and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Used items cost less than their new equivalents and only would be subject to tariffs if they come from outside the country.",
      "\u201cI think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining,\u201d said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst at market research firm Circana. \u201cWhat I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.\u201d",
      "The outlook for preowned fashion nevertheless comes with unknowns, including whether the president's tariffs will stay long enough to pinch consumers and change their behavior. It's also unclear whether secondhand purveyors will increase their own prices, either to mirror the overall market or in response to shopper demand.",
      "Jan Genovese, a retired fashion executive, sells her unwanted designer clothes through customer-to-customer marketplaces like Mercari. If tariffs cause retail prices to rise, she would consider high-end secondhand sites.",
      "\u201cUntil I see it and really have that sticker shock, I can\u2019t say exclusively that I\u2019ll be pushed into another direction,\u201d Genovese, 75, said. \u201cI think that the tariff part of it is that you definitely rethink things. And maybe I will start looking at alternative venues.\u201d",
      "The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicted after the COVID-19 pandemic that global revenue from preowned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in a more environmentally conscious way.",
      "While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower shows the audience may be expanding.",
      "The number of mobile app downloads for nine resale marketplaces the firm tracks \u2014 eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist, Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted \u2014 increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said.",
      "The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiled since-paused punitive tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Circana\u2019s Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusual vintage pieces to supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items.",
      "\"It's still a cheaper option\u201d than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said.",
      "Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell preowned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said.",
      "Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will \u201cpay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market\u201d from the tariffs, Chandra said.",
      "Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said.",
      "\"Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people\u2019s closets or in warehouses not being used,\u201d offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty,\u201d Gittins said. \u201cEveryone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone\u2019s head is going.\"",
      "Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains and department stores because they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S.",
      "Still, resale vendors aren't immune from tariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry's environmental impact.",
      "U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% duty if Trump moves forward with instituting \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said.",
      "A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trump already ended the duty-free provision for low-value parcels from China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by making low-priced Chinese fashions pricier, she said.",
      "James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the \u201cde minimis\u201d provision and the 145% tariff Trump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands.",
      "\u201cBrands will explore this and they may do more, but I don\u2019t see them massively changing their operations,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don\u2019t think resale helps you survive.\u201d",
      "Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said.",
      "Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel's 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said.",
      "\u201cThat has nothing to do with the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are feeling priced out.\u201d",
      "Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop.",
      "If tariffs upend the economics of fast fashion and discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus.",
      "\u201cI would love if this would steer people in a different direction,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Removing lanes to slow down speeding drivers is a long-embraced strategy for improving safety on city streets",
      "A stylist was just starting her shift at a salon in Kansas City, Missouri, when a car smashed through the storefront window and landed in the waiting area a few feet away.",
      "Such crashes were so common along 31st Street that business owners regularly texted one another photos showing the damage caused by vehicles speeding along the four-lane road lined with shops, bars and restaurants, which drivers used as a shortcut between major highways.",
      "\u201cA wide road makes people think, \u2018We\u2019ll just drive as fast as we want on it,'\" said Ryan Ferrell, who owns the property housing the salon, a bookstore and apartments above.",
      "When concrete sidewalk barriers didn\u2019t work, Ferrell and other business leaders campaigned to put the street on a \u201croad diet.\"",
      "Removing lanes has been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. President Donald Trump's administration doesn't like it either.",
      "Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%, but criteria for an upcoming round of road safety grants say projects aimed at \u201creducing lane capacity\u201d should be considered \u201cless favorably,\" the administration said.",
      "Forcing travelers into more constrained spaces \u201ccan lead to crashes, erratic maneuvers, and a false sense of security that puts everyone at risk,\u201d the U.S. Department of Transportation said in an email statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThe update reflects the Department\u2019s concerns about the safety hazards associated with congestion.\u201d",
      "Kansas City saved some money when it converted 31st Street in 2022 because a gas line was going in anyway. It reopened with one lane in each direction instead of two, a shared turn lane near the signalized intersections, better pedestrian crossings and protected on-street parking spaces.",
      "Road diets are now an almost automatic part of the process in Kansas City whenever a street is up for repaving. For years, federal guidelines said lane reductions were usually appropriate on roads carrying fewer than 25,000 vehicles a day. Most of the city's four-lane roads don't meet that threshold.",
      "Bobby Evans, an urban planner at the Mid-America Regional Council who has worked on Kansas City's road diets, calls the strategy \"a smashing success\" and one of the most effective tools at reducing speed, crashes and injuries.",
      "\u201cIn the architectural world you\u2019d call it environmental determinism,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou want to make it so they don\u2019t feel comfortable going too fast. You\u2019re really not slowing them down. You\u2019re bringing them back to the speed limit.\u201d",
      "Numerous other cities have credited road diets with improving safety.",
      "Philadelphia cited a 19% drop in injury crashes. Portland, Oregon, saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph (16 kph) over the speed limit. The average speed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fell by 5 mph (8 kph) on some roads within months.",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said most road diets represent an ill-advised effort to force vehicles off the road. The number of vehicles may decline on dieted roads, but then surrounding roads have to absorb the traffic, he said.",
      "\u201cThose cars have to go somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cCars are like water. They seek their own level.\u201d",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said road diets are inexpensive and supported by years of research. Cities in Republican-led states are among the converts and Shahum isn't sure if the Trump administration's new guidance will make them reconsider.",
      "\u201cI certainly hope that does not bleed over into indirectly discouraging communities from using this proven safety countermeasure,\u201d Shahum said. \u201cThat would be a real loss.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s transportation department cited delivery and emergency vehicles among its concerns.",
      "When University of Iowa researchers surveyed first-responders in Cedar Rapids, their study published last year found no noticeable difference in response time when a road diet was in place. There was, however, a perceived need to educate drivers about what to do when an ambulance uses a center turn lane to pass.",
      "Cara Hamann, an associate professor of epidemiology who co-authored the study, said she recalled no major examples of EMS or fire trucks being unable to get through.",
      "\u201cThe road diet didn\u2019t cause a level of congestion that slowed them down,\u201d she said.",
      "Even before Trump, skepticism was growing in some red states.",
      "San Antonio spent years planning to repurpose a formerly state-owned portion of its Broadway Street by removing vehicle lanes and improving a stretch for bikes and pedestrians. But Texas abruptly reclaimed the road in 2022 and nixed the project as GOP Gov. Greg Abbott ran for reelection and called for an end to anti-car policies.",
      "\u201cThey basically used Broadway as a political football,\u201d said Bryan Martin, owner of Bronko Bikes, an electric bike repair shop.",
      "Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last year a 180-day review period and other numerous steps before a local government can eliminate a lane. He said it would prevent activists from intentionally clogging roads to slow vehicles.",
      "Not all the pushback has come from Republican-led states. During the pandemic, Culver City, California, implemented a road diet to prioritize walking, biking and transit. But when cars returned and traffic backed up for miles, the city reversed the plan.",
      "Some residents sued in Vancouver, Washington, saying the city should have put its road diets up for a public vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen people passing in the shoulder or the bike lane,\u201d said Justin Wood, one of the opponents. \u201cIt creates more opportunity for conflict.\u201d",
      "Evans, the planner in Kansas City, said road diets can't stop all reckless drivers.",
      "\u201cIf you are bound and determined to go 12 miles over the speed limit on a three-lane road, you\u2019re going to have to engage in some stupid, dangerous driving,\u201d Evans said.",

      "Those walls were possible through a federal program that pays rent for some 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. Espinal was fleeing both.",
      "But the program, Emergency Housing Vouchers, is running out of money \u2014 and quickly.",
      "Funding is expected to be used up by the end of next year, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and obtained by The Associated Press. That would leave tens of thousands across the country scrambling to pay their rent.",
      "It would be among the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., analysts say, and the ensuing evictions could churn these people \u2014 after several years of rebuilding their lives \u2014 back onto the street or back into abusive relationships.",
      "\"To have it stop would completely upend all the progress that they\u2019ve made,\u201d said Sonya Acosta, policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which researches housing assistance.",

      "The program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, was allocated $5 billion to help pull people out of homelessness, domestic violence and human trafficking.",
      "People from San Francisco to Dallas to Tallahassee, Florida, were enrolled \u2014 among them children, seniors and veterans \u2014 with the expectation that funding would last until the end of the decade.",
      "But with the ballooning cost of rent, that $5 billion will end far faster.",
      "Last month, HUD sent letters to groups dispersing the money, advising them to \"manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.\"",
      "The program's future rests with Congress, which could decide to add money as it crafts the federal budget. But it's a relatively expensive prospect at a time when Republicans, who control Congress, are dead set on cutting federal spending to afford tax cuts.",
      "Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who championed the program four years ago, is pushing for another $8 billion infusion.",
      "But the organizations lobbying Republican and Democratic lawmakers to reup the funding told the AP they aren't optimistic. Four GOP lawmakers who oversee the budget negotiations did not respond to AP requests for comment.",

      "Four years ago, Espinal fought her way out of a marriage where her husband controlled her decisions, from seeing her family and friends to leaving the apartment to go shopping.",

      "Isolated and in the haze of postpartum depression, she didn\u2019t know what to believe. \u201cEvery day, little by little, I started to feel not like myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like my mind wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d",
      "When notices arrived in March 2021 seeking about $12,000 in back rent, it was a shock. Espinal had quit her job at her husband's urging and he had promised to cover family expenses.",
      "Police reports documenting her husband\u2019s bursts of anger were enough for a judge to give her custody of their daughter in 2022, Espinal said.",

      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial aircraft taking off and landing at major U.S. airports",
      "WASHINGTON -- A commercial airliner was on final approach to San Francisco\u2019s international airport in November when the crew spotted a drone outside the cockpit window. By then it was too late \u201cto take evasive action,\u201d the pilots reported, and the quadcopter passed by their windshield, not 300 feet away.",
      "A month earlier, a jetliner was flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet near Miami\u2019s international airport when its pilots reported a \u201cclose encounter\u201d with a drone. In August, a drone came within 50 feet of clipping the left wing of a passenger jet as it departed Newark International Airport.",
      "The incidents were all classified as \u201cnear midair collisions\u201d \u2014 any one of which could have had catastrophic consequences, according to aviation safety experts. They were also not isolated encounters.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial passenger planes taking off and landing at the country's top 30 busiest airports. That was the highest percentage of such near misses since 2020, when air traffic dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The first reports of near misses involving drones were logged in 2014, the AP found. The number of such encounters spiked the following year. Over the last decade, drones accounted for 51% \u2014 122 of 240 \u2014 of reported near misses, according to AP's analysis.",
      "Passenger jets have long been subject to risks around airports \u2014 whether from bird strikes or congested airspace \u2014 as was made clear by the January collision between a military helicopter and commercial jet near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.",
      "The threat from drones has become more acute in the last decade as the use of quadcopters and remote-controlled planes has exploded in popularity. The FAA estimates that Americans are operating more than a million drones for recreational and commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cIf you have the money, you can go on the internet and buy a pretty sophisticated drone that can reach altitudes they really have no business being at,\u201d said William Waldock, a professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.",
      "The risk is most acute near airports because that is where the flight paths of drones and airplanes most overlap, experts said.",
      "The incidents represent only a portion of such close calls because the database \u2014 NASA\u2019s Aviation Safety Reporting System \u2014 relies on voluntary submissions from pilots and other aviation workers. A separate FAA program, which includes reports from the public, tallied at least 160 sightings last month of drones flying near airports.",
      "\u201cThe FAA recognizes that urgency, and we all know additional changes need to be made to allow the airports to go out and detect and mitigate where necessary,\u201d said Hannah Thach, executive director of the partnership, known as Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence.",
      "The FAA said it has taken steps to mitigate the risks of drones. It has prohibited nearly all drones from flying near airports without prior authorization, though such rules are difficult to enforce, and recreational users may not be aware of restrictions.",
      "The agency requires registrations for drones weighing more than 250 grams (0.55 pounds), and such drones are required to carry a radio transponder that identifies the drone\u2019s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Additional rules govern commercial drone use.",
      "The agency has also been testing systems to detect and counter drones near airports. Among the methods being examined: Using radio signals to jam drones or force them to land. Authorities are also weighing whether to deploy high-powered microwaves or laser beams to disable the machines.",
      "Experts said the FAA and other authorities could do more. They suggested creating a system similar to speed cameras on roadways that could capture a drone\u2019s transponder code and send its pilots a ticket in the mail.",
      "They also said the FAA should consider regulations that require all manufacturers to program a drone\u2019s GPS unit to prevent it from flying near airports and other sensitive areas, a method called \u201cgeofencing.\u201d",
      "DJI, a leading drone maker, used such geofencing restrictions for years. However, it eliminated the feature in January, replacing it with an alert to drone pilots when they approach restricted areas.",
      "Adam Welsh, head of global policy at DJI, said managing requests from authorized users to temporarily disable the geofencing became an increasingly time-consuming task. More than one million such requests were processed last year.",
      "\u201cWe had around-the-clock service, but the number of applications coming in were becoming really hard to handle,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cThey all had to be reviewed individually.\u201d",
      "With no other manufacturers enabling geofencing, and without government rules requiring it, DJI decided to end the practice, he said.",
      "The FAA declined to say if it is considering whether to mandate geofencing.",
      "Experts said authorities should take more aggressive action to hold drone users accountable for violating restricted airspace \u2014 to highlight the problem and deter others from breaking the rules, pointing to recent arrests that they hoped might send such a message.",
      "In December, for example, Boston police arrested two men who operated a drone that flew dangerously close to Logan International Airport. Police reported that they were able to find the drone flyers, in part, by tracking the aircraft thanks to its FAA-mandated transponder signal.",
      "A month later, a small drone collided with a \u201cSuper Scooper\u201d plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane's left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs.",
      "Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man, who has yet to be sentenced, admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that's when it struck the \u201cSuper Scooper.\"",

      "The Kansas City, Missouri, metropolitan area has long been a regional hub for the federal government, and the pain from the Trump administration's cuts can be seen everywhere",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs.",
      "Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion.",
      "But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at the Administration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cNot only me, but all these peoples\u2019 lives are turned upside down,\u201d Giagnorio said.",
      "The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.",
      "With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.",
      "An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout.",
      "A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood\u2019s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded.",
      "The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic.",
      "A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market.",
      "And the city's Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk\u2019s electric car company out of Missouri.",
      "The nation's health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency's 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families.",
      "\u201cThe poor will become even more poor now,\u201d Giagnorio said. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we\u2019re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?\u201d",
      "Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers.",
      "But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn\u2019t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year.",
      "For now, she can\u2019t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when?",
      "The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful.",
      "The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what\u2019s required of them,\u201d said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.",
      "By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week.",
      "Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies.",
      "Ellis said IRS workers share the public\u2019s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she\u2019s decided to take a \u201croll of the dice\u201d and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer.",
      "\u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the bully force me out.\u201d",
      "Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century.",
      "Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers\u2019 market serving the area.",
      "Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children.",
      "In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",
      "Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising.",
      "At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt just means giving families less food,\u201d said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he\u2019s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.",
      "One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.",
      "Kansas City\u2019s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.",
      "\u201cThat early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,\u201d she said.",
      "But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration's $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news \u201ccrushed\u201d the department's carefully laid plans, Jones said.",
      "Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents.",
      "\u201cIt would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.\u201d",
      "Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he\u2019s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.",
      "Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month.",
      "Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz of hundreds of lease cancellations that has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.",
      "In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE\u2019s online \u201cWall of Receipts.\u201d",
      "Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market.",
      "But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cBusinesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going to be unhappy but it\u2019s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.\u201d",
      "With liberal anger growing at Musk\u2019s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts.",
      "State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close.",
      "Organizers of a newly launched \u201cUnplug Musk\u201d initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world\u2019s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.",
      "They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a soul in this country who\u2019s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people\u2019s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that. And it is going to cause some devastating impacts,\u201d said organizer Brad Ketcher, a prominent Democrat and lawyer who helped draft the state\u2019s 2022 marijuana legalization referendum.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "The IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public.",
      "Musk said last year that Trump\u2019s budget cuts would cause a \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d that would soon put the economy on stronger footing.",
      "One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses.",
      "\u201cIt's a big burden that\u2019s being placed on a narrow group of people,\u201d said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. \u201cIt will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.\"",
      "Trump has credited DOGE with helping end \u201cthe flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d saving billions to help improve the nation\u2019s finances.",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about Kansas City. But Trump said recently he would invite the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to make up for a 2020 Super Bowl victory celebration that was canceled during the pandemic.",

      "Sam Rutledge and his wife have a baby due in mid-July, so they thought they had a few more months to research and buy the gear they\u2019ll need.",
      "But President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April turned the couple\u2019s slow walk into a sprint. In the past few weeks, they\u2019ve bought two strollers, a car seat, a nursery glider, a crib and a high chair. All of them are made overseas.",
      "\u201cThese are all pretty expensive under normal conditions, but when it became clear tariffs were coming we decided to buy them in case they became prohibitively expensive,\u201d said Rutledge, who is a high school physics teacher.",
      "Raising a child in America has never been cheap. In the first year alone, it costs an average of $20,384, according to Baby Center, a parenting website. But tariffs \u2013 ranging from 10% for imports from most countries to 145% for imports from China -- will make it many times more expensive for new parents.",
      "An estimated 90% of the core baby care products and the parts that go into making baby paraphernalia \u2013 from bottles and diaper pails to strollers and car seats \u2013 are made in Asia, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, a U.S. trade group. The vast majority come from China.",
      "\u201cOverseas manufacturing has been the norm in our industry for decades,\u201d said Lisa Trofe, the association's executive director.",
      "It wasn\u2019t always this way. When Munchkin Inc. CEO Steven Dunn founded his company in 1991, it made baby bottles in California with tooling from New Jersey. But over the years, the manufacturers he used shut down and the cost of doing business in the U.S. skyrocketed. Now, about 60% of Munchkin\u2019s 500 products, from a $5 sippy cup to a $254 Night Owl Stroller with headlights, are made in China.",
      "In response to the tariffs, Dunn halted orders from China and instituted a hiring freeze at Munchkin\u2019s California headquarters, where 320 people are employed. Dunn expects Munchkin will run out of some products within three months.",
      "\u201cThere is no possibility of being able to pass on those tariffs\u201d to customers in the form of price increases, he said.",
      "Dunn said he tried to reduce his dependence on China in recent years, shifting some manufacturing to Vietnam and Mexico. He also spent a year communicating with American manufacturers to see if one could make Munchkin\u2019s new Flow Nipple Shield, which allows a breastfeeding mother to see if her milk is flowing. But most said they couldn\u2019t make the complex silicone product, Dunn said. It\u2019s now made in Vietnam.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough tool makers and manufacturing expertise and automation and skilled labor in the U.S. to make the thousands of products the juvenile industry needs,\u201d Dunn said.",
      "Multiple baby brands and companies contacted by The Associated Press didn\u2019t respond or said they weren\u2019t commenting on the tariffs, including Graco, Chicco, Britax, Nuna, Dorel Juvenile, UppaBaby, Evenflo and Bugaboo.",
      "The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association said it asked the Trump administration for a tariff exemption, arguing that baby products are essential for children's well-being. Trump exempted some baby products, including car seats and high chairs, from import taxes during his first administration. But he hasn't said whether he would consider doing so again.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with the White House.",
      "Nurture&, a company that makes a popular nursery glider and other baby furniture, said it\u2019s trying to be transparent about the impact of tariffs.",
      "In a recent email, the company told customers it started lowering prices on some items when the tariffs hit. The company, which was founded in 2020, said it would keep those lower prices in place until April 30, but after that it may not be able to absorb the full cost of the import duties.",
      "\u201cThese are large purchases, these are investments, and this is a very sensitive life stage,\u201d Nurture& Chief Merchant Jill Gruys said. \u201cWe want people to make the best decision for their budget and their family.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Mahon, the owner of Three Littles, a baby store in Washington, said she\u2019s worried the tariffs will make essential products too expensive for some families.",
      "Mahon volunteers twice per month at the Department of Motor Vehicles, where she teaches people how to buckle their kids safely into car seats. Some families still must be persuaded to use car seats, she said. Mahon fears higher prices would be another deterrent.",
      "\u201cNo one is dying if they can\u2019t buy a toy, but if they don\u2019t have access to car seats, kids will get seriously injured,\u201d she said.",
      "At her own store, Mahon is getting notices that some manufacturers plan to introduce steep price increases in May. She feels lucky she could rent a storage facility and build up inventory ahead of the tariffs. For many small businesses, she said, the extra costs are \u201ca death sentence.\u201d",
      "At The Little Seedling baby shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, owner Molly Ging said she would normally be putting in Christmas orders at this time of year. Instead, she\u2019s sorting through price increase notices from many of the vendors she works with.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to manage, and I just have no idea how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d she said.",

      "The surprise transfers of brothers Nico and Madden Iamaleava have prompted fresh questions about contracts and name, image and likeness buyouts for athletes in a college sports landscape looking increasingly like the pros",
      "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- The surprise transfers of brothers Nico and Madden Iamaleava have prompted fresh questions about contracts and name, image and likeness buyouts for athletes in a college sports landscape looking increasingly like the pros.",
      "Nico Iamaleava, who led Tennessee to the College Football Playoff last season, walked away from a reported $2.4 million NIL contract to seek higher pay elsewhere. He joined UCLA on Sunday, reportedly for half the money though terms of any NIL deal were not released.",
      "Arkansas freshman quarterback Madden Iamaleava entered the portal this week not long after spring practices wrapped up and will join his brother at UCLA, according to multiple media reports.",
      "Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek released a statement indicating he would support efforts by the Razorbacks' NIL collective to enforce buyout clauses in athlete contracts. Iamaleava reportedly had a contract valued at $500,000 upon signing with Arkansas on Dec. 4, according to reports.",
      "Arkansas Edge, the school's collective, requires athletes to repay 50% of their remaining contract value if they leave before the contract expires, according to reports. The Arkansas athletic department declined to comment and Arkansas Edge did not respond to messages.",
      "Yurachek, in a post on X that did not name Iamaleava, wrote: \u201cI have spoken with the leadership team at Arkansas Edge and expressed my support in their pursuit to enforce their rights under any agreement violated by our student-athletes moving forward. We appreciate Edge's investment in our student-athletes and acknowledge the enforcement of these agreements is vital in our new world of college athletics.\u201d",
      "The latest cycle of transfers has seen a lot of chaos and accusations of tampering. Earlier this year, Wisconsin said it had \u201ccredible information\u201d that Miami and Xavier Lucas made impermissible contact with each other before the former Badgers cornerback decided to transfer to his home-state school.",
      "All this comes with final approval of the $2.8 billion NCAA antitrust settlement looming. The plan will clear the way for Division I schools to share up to $20.5 million each with their athletes annually but also assess NIL deals athletes sign with third parties.",
      "The settlement would go into effect July 1, and athletes have been scrambling to renegotiate contracts or find better opportunities at new schools before deals valued at $600 or more must be approved through a clearinghouse that will be administered in part by financial giant Deloitte in a bid to establish fair market value.",
      "Rich Stankewicz, the director of operations for the Happy Valley United collective backing Penn State athletics, said he thinks there is a time and place for NIL buyouts, citing a spring transfer departing before playing a snap as an example. He favors incentive-based contracts contingent on in-season academic and athletic performance.",
      "\u201cIf more money is paid out in those time frames, that gives incentive for the player to stay and see those dollars from their contract, rather than potentially collecting up front and then deciding the grass is greener somewhere else three months later,\u201d he told the Associated Press.",
      "Iamaleava, who is from Long Beach, California, initially pledged to UCLA last May. He made a signing-day flip from the Bruins to Arkansas and enrolled in January. He was the No. 3 quarterback in spring practice behind Taylen Green and KJ Jackson.",
      "Some of the questions amid all the transferring and severed deals center on whether NIL deals are enforceable contracts with the NCAA settlement not yet approved.",
      "Matthew Shepherd, an attorney and member of the Arkansas House of Representatives, co-sponsored the state's NIL law. He said if Madden Iamaleava left on his own volition, the terms of the NIL deal would be subject to standard contract law.",
      "Shepherd noted the NIL law was modified in 2023 to include a provision prohibiting a third party from offering NIL inducements to an athlete who already is enrolled at one of the state's schools or who has entered into an enrollment contract. If that happened in Iamaleava's case, Shepherd said, the school or third party such as an NIL collective could take legal action against the violating party.",

      "\u201cVery excited for the next chapter,\u201d the versatile 23-year-old guard said.",
      "Bueckers and the other four players drafted by the Wings on April 14 were introduced in a packed lobby at Dallas City Hall that included the mayor, the city council and city workers, some watching from perches on the second and third floors.",
      "\u201cWell, it was Christmas nine days ago (at the draft). Certainly, today feels like New Year\u2019s Eve or New Year\u2019s Day with the optimism and all the momentum around the Dallas Wings,\u201d new general manager Curt Miller said.",
      "There was never a question for Miller or the Wings about who their top pick would be when they won the WNBA draft lottery.",
      "\u201cThe big picture is that we knew what that meant ... exciting, exciting moment,\u201d Miller said. \u201cPaige obviously comes off a national championship, one of the most decorated collegiate players and one of the most efficient players in college basketball history.\u201d",
      "Along with proclamations from the mayor, there were also the cowboy hats for each of the Wings draftees: Bueckers, 12th overall pick Aziaha James from North Carolina State, 14th pick Madison Scott from Mississippi, 27th pick JJ Quinerly from West Virginia and 31st pick Aaronette Vonleh from Baylor.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s talked about just being a part of a new family, being a part of a new city. Dallas is a great sports city, you can feel the love and support already,\u201d Bueckers said. \"There's lot of new in this organization, so be a part of something and build with each other, and just create a new sisterhood.\u201d",
      "The introductory news conference was held a couple of blocks from the historic downtown arena being fully renovated to become the new home of the Wings next season.",
      "But Bueckers\u2019 home games in her first season with the Wings will be about 20 miles away at College Park Center at UT-Arlington, where they will play their 10th and final season since the franchise relocated from Tulsa, Oklahoma.",
      "Except for one home game on June 27. The Wings that night will play Indiana and Caitlin Clark, last year\u2019s No. 1 overall pick, at the home of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks.",
      "It was a year ago Thursday that the Dallas City Council approved a 15-year agreement worth $19 million to facilitate the team\u2019s pending move to its namesake city. The council also approved a $7.7 million renovation to the arena that was once home to the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, who moved to San Antonio to become the Spurs in 1973, and joined the NBA when the ABA folded three years later.",
      "\u201cWe stood right here in this building, and we proudly announced that the Dallas Wings would soon be making downtown Dallas their permanent home,\u201d Mayor Eric Johnson said Wednesday. \u201cAnd since then, the excitement has only grown, the fan base has rallied and today we\u2019re taking the next big step forward. Welcome, everyone, to the future of Dallas sports.\u201d",

      "The players have all pleaded not guilty to sexual assault, and McLeod has also pleaded not guilty to an additional charge of being a party to the offense of sexual assault.",
      "In her opening statement, Donkers said the complainant \u2014 who cannot be identified under a standard publication ban \u2014 met McLeod, Dube and some others at a bar on the same night that many of the team\u2019s members attended a gala in the city.",

      "Each of the five players is alleged to have had sexual contact with the complainant without her voluntarily agreeing to those specific acts, Donkers said.",

      "Rory McIlroy says he wasn't going to let a cold or post-Masters fatigue stop him from joining friend Shane Lowry to defend their title at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans",
      "AVONDALE, La. -- Rory McIlroy \u2014 his voice raspy from a cold that made it tough for him to get out of bed a couple of days earlier \u2014 expressed relief that he'd have a teammate to lean on in his first PGA Tour event since his historic triumph at the Masters two weekends ago.",
      "\u201cJust to be here and feeling better is an achievement,\u201d McIlroy said Wednesday while seated next to Shane Lowry, his teammate in this week's Zurich Classic of New Orleans, where the pair are defending champions. \u201cBut I need to put a little bit of practice and a bit of work in today to make sure I don\u2019t let this man down.\u201d",
      "The way McIlroy's humility and authenticity complement his extraordinary talent has made him arguably the most popular and charismatic golfer in the world.",
      "That hasn't changed since he became just the sixth man to win all four majors tournaments by edging Justin Rose in a playoff at Augusta National on April 13.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing few days, to be able to reflect on it and everything that happened and the magnitude of everything,\" McIlroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you get to fulfill one of your lifelong goals and dreams, and I\u2019ve just tried to enjoy everything that comes along with that.",
      "\u201cI obviously could not be in a better place in my life \u2014 professionally, personally, all of it,\u201d McIlroy added.",
      "Golf wasn't a top priority for McIlroy in the nine days between winning his first green jacket and playing his practice round at the TPC Louisiana on Wednesday.",
      "The Northern Ireland native went to London with wife Erica and daughter Poppy to check on a home they're building there, then hopped over the Irish Sea to Belfast to be with family and lifelong friends.",
      "He received countless messages of congratulations from fans, other elite athletes and \u201cpeople that you would never even think would watch golf or would know what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "He said two presidents reached out, as did some in the entertainment industry. Many communicated that they found his path inspiring not just because of the composure he summoned after losing the lead in the final round of this year's Masters, but also in light of some of his dramatic final-round disappointments \u2014 or collapses \u2014 in years past. His 2011 Masters, when he shot a final-round 80 and lost a four-shot lead, comes to mind.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me is just how the whole journey resonated with people,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cPeople can see themselves in the struggle at times and everything that you sort of try to put into getting the best out of yourself in that journey.\u201d",
      "McIlroy has been playing some of the best golf of his career in the past year \u2014 and pointed to his decision to pair up with Lowry, an Irishman and old friend, at the 2024 Zurich Classic as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for that.",
      "\u201cThis tournament last year was a really cool moment for both of us and I think it probably injected a little bit of joy back into golf for me in some way, which I think is really, really important not to lose that,\u201d McIlroy said.",
      "That is why \u2014 despite his post-Masters fatigue and the cold he caught \u2014 he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d committed to coming back.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun event to be out there with Shane and I also know that it\u2019s not all on me,\" McIlroy said. \"He has to do some of the work, too, maybe a lot of it the next few days. It\u2019s a perfect tournament to come back to with good positive vibes from last year.\u201d",
      "Lowry recalled being on the 15th hole during his final round at Augusta National, out of the running for a win and watching the leaderboard to see if McIlroy would finally get his green jacket. It was then that he wondered aloud to his caddie if McIlroy might skip New Orleans.",
      "\u201cI was very excited that Rory still decided to come here because I just want to see what it\u2019s going to be like this week,\u201d Lowry said. \"I\u2019m sure the crowds are going to be huge.",
      "\u201cI know he\u2019s not done much practicing in the last two weeks. I know I\u2019m going to have to step up, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Lowry continued.",
      "Lowry said he's comfortable with his role on McIlroy's team \u2014 even now that his teammate has reached a new level of historical significance in golf and stardom in general.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known Rory for years and we\u2019re good friends,\u201d Lowry said. \"So, if I was sitting beside another guy that just completed the Grand Slam and I was his partner this week, it might feel a little bit different. But I know him so well. Nothing phases me being around him.\u201d",

      "This year\u2019s NFL draft is on target to achieve a first",
      "This year's NFL draft is on target to achieve a first.",
      "Barring a last-minute trade, every team will go into the draft with its original first-round pick for the first time in the common draft era that began in 1967.",
      "That's in stark contrast to recent years when teams were much more willing to trade away or swap first-round picks, with an average of more than seven teams entering the last five drafts without their original first-round picks. That peaked in 2022 when 11 teams entered draft day without their own first-round pick thanks in part to previous deals for players like Deshaun Watson, Russell Wilson, Trey Lance, Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams.",
      "The closest the league has come in the common draft era with every team holding its own first-round pick, according to research by ESPN, came in 1993 when Kansas City dealt its first-rounder to San Francisco for Joe Montana five days before the draft.",
      "The static picks are unlikely to hold through the first round on Thursday night as teams are likely to make moves up or down the board depending on which players are available. Just last year there were five draft-day trades involving first-round picks that saw picks change hands eight times.",
      "It looks like a quarterback once again will be taken first in the draft, with the odds that Cam Ward goes No. 1 to Tennessee exceeding 99%, according to the latest odds from BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "That would mark the seventh time in eight years that a QB went first, with Jacksonville's pick of Travon Walker in 2022 as the only exception. That's been part of a long trend as the NFL has prioritized passing. Quarterbacks have been taken first overall in 20 of the previous 27 drafts.",
      "But that wasn't always the case.",
      "Drew Bledsoe (1993 to New England) was the only quarterback from 1991-97 to be taken first, and there was an 11-year stretch from 1972-82 that had only one QB taken with the No. 1 pick: Steve Bartkowski to Atlanta in 1975.",
      "Almost every team has taken a shot on a first-round quarterback in recent years, but the team with the longest drought could snap it on Thursday.",
      "New Orleans hasn't drafted a quarterback with its first-round pick in the common draft since taking Archie Manning in 1971, but it could snap that streak this year given the uncertainty surrounding the status of Derek Carr.",
      "The only other teams that haven't drafted a QB in the first round in the past 15 drafts are the the Cowboys (1989), Seahawks (1993), Raiders (2007) and Lions (2009).",
      "The Tennessee Titans are set to pick first in the draft for the first time since the franchise took Earl Campbell in 1978 when the team was known as the Houston Oilers.",
      "The Titans traded away the top pick in 2016 to the Rams but now have a chance, marking the seventh time that the top pick has gone to an AFC South team since the start of the eight-division era in 2002.",
      "The AFC South will be the first division in that span with every team making the No. 1 pick, with Houston having done it three times since 2002, Jacksonville twice and Indianapolis once.",
      "Next up on the list is the AFC North, where Cleveland and Cincinnati have both had the top pick twice, and the NFC West, with the Rams having the top pick twice and Arizona and San Francisco once each since 2002.",
      "The AFC West and NFC South have each made the top pick three times in that span, with the NFC North doing it twice and AFC East doing it once.",
      "The only division that hasn't made the top pick since 2002 is the NFC East, although that comes with a bit of a caveat. In 2004, the Chargers drafted Eli Manning first overall but traded him during the draft to the New York Giants. The last time a team in the NFC East made the No. 1 pick was in 1991, when Dallas drafted Russell Maryland.",

      "Managing partner John Collins will lead a search to find the Islanders\u2019 next GM.",
      "Lamoriello, 82, spent the past seven seasons running their hockey operations with a close connection to ownership. Before that, he worked as president and GM of the New Jersey Devils from 1987-2015, a stretch during which they won the Stanley Cup three times.",
      "A Hall of Famer in the builders category, Lamoriello\u2019s old-school approach with everything from not sharing information to banning facial hair for players and coaches made him a rarity in modern hockey and arguably played a part in stagnating the once widely successful franchise.",

      "NASCAR driver Katherine Legge said she has been receiving \u201chate mail\u201d and \u201cdeath threats\u201d from auto racing fans after a crash last weekend at Rockingham",
      "NASCAR driver Katherine Legge said she has been receiving \u201chate mail\u201d and \u201cdeath threats\u201d from auto racing fans after she was involved in a crash that collected veteran driver Kasey Kahne during the Xfinity Series race last weekend at Rockingham.",
      "Legge, who has started four Indy 500s but is a relative novice in stock cars, added during Tuesday's episode of her \u201cThrottle Therapy\u201d podcast that \u201cthe inappropriate social media comments I've received aren't just disturbing, they are unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be very clear,\u201d the British driver said, \u201cI'm here to race and I'm here to compete, and I won't tolerate any of these threats to my safety or to my dignity, whether that's on track or off of it.\u201d",
      "Legge became the first woman in seven years to start a Cup Series race earlier this year at Phoenix. But her debut in NASCAR's top series ended when Legge, who had already spun once, was involved in another spin and collected Daniel Suarez.",
      "Her next start was the lower-level Xfinity race in Rockingham, North Carolina, last Saturday. Legge was good enough to make the field on speed but was bumped off the starting grid because of ownership points. Ultimately, she was able to take J.J. Yeley's seat in the No. 53 car for Joey Gase Motorsports, which had to scramble at the last minute to prepare the car for her.",
      "Legge was well off the pace as the leaders were lapping her, and when she entered Turn 1, William Sawalich got into the back of her car. That sent Legge spinning, and Kahne had nowhere to go, running into her along the bottom of the track.",
      "\u201cI gave (Sawalich) a lane and the reason the closing pace looks so high isn\u2019t because I braked mid-corner. I didn\u2019t. I stayed on my line, stayed doing my speed, which obviously isn\u2019t the speed of the leaders because they\u2019re passing me,\u201d Legge said. \u201cHe charged in a bit too hard, which is the speed difference you see. He understeered up a lane and into me, which spun me around.\u201d",
      "The 44-year-old Legge has experience in a variety of cars across numerous series. She made seven IndyCar starts for Dale Coyne Racing last year, and she has raced for several teams over more than a decade in the IMSA SportsCar series.",
      "She has dabbled in NASCAR in the past, too, starting four Xfinity races during the 2018 season and another two years ago.",
      "\u201cI have earned my seat on that race track,\" Legge said. \"I\u2019ve worked just as hard as any of the other drivers out there, and I\u2019ve been racing professionally for the last 20 years. I\u2019m 100 percent sure that the ... the teams that employed me \u2014 without me bringing any sponsorship money for the majority of those 20 years \u2014 did not do so as a DEI hire, or a gimmick, or anything else. It\u2019s because I can drive a race car.\u201d",
      "Legge believes the vitriol she has received on social media is indicative of a larger issue with women in motorsports.",
      "\u201cLuckily,\u201d she said, \u201cI have been in tougher battles than you guys in the comment sections.\u201d",
      "Legge has received plenty of support from those in the racing community. IndyCar driver Marco Andretti clapped back at one critic on social media who called Legge \u201cunproven\u201d in response to a post about her history at the Indy 500.",
      "\u201cIt's wild to me how many grown men talk badly about badass girls like this,\u201d Andretti wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cDoes it make them feel more manly from the couch or something?\u201d",

      "Speaking at the CAA World Congress of Sports presented by the Sports Business Journal on an array of topics, Silver seemed particularly pleased with the ratings from the first eight games \u2014 four on Saturday, four more on Sunday.",
      "\u201cHighest rated opening weekend in 25 years ... so the numbers are fantastic,\" Silver said before the NBA released the official ratings.",
      "The league said the eight games over the weekend averaged 4.4 million viewers, the highest average in 25 years and a 17% increase over the opening weekend of last season\u2019s playoffs.",
      "ESPN added that it was the most-watched opening weekend ever on its platforms, with nearly 6.7 million people on average watching Sunday\u2019s Boston-Orlando game on ABC and a peak of just over 8 million for that game.",
      "Silver said what really excites him moving to a digital world is the ability to reach fans in a variety of ways.",
      "\u201cI say think of the Manning House but on steroids,\u201d Silver said. \"Essentially unlimited numbers of alternative channels.\u201d",

      "Many NFL fans spend the weeks leading up the draft poring over mock drafts to try to figure out which players their favorites teams are most likely to select.",
      "Those projections quickly become obsolete once the actual draft begins with some predicted targets inevitably coming off the board before a team even makes its pick.",
      "That was the motivation for the NFL's NextGen Stats team to create a new draft site that takes elements from the old draft preview magazines with the easily digestible information with the ability to adapt seamlessly with each move made before or during the draft.",
      "\u201cThe draft magazine was so efficient at displaying information in a easy to digest way,\u201d said Mike Band, the senior manager for research and analytics at NFL NextGen Stats. \u201cIn a lot of ways as we\u2019ve optimized for mobile experiences, we\u2019ve lost that art of a dashboard-like experience. That was the impetus for this project, creating a digital magazine that could be updated live and evolve in a dynamic way and hopefully have really fun and engaging live features.\u201d",
      "The NFL Draft IQ site launched earlier this month to preview the draft was designed to be the ideal second screen during the draft starting Thursday night. The site includes team-by-team pages that list each team's picks in the next two drafts, moves they had made in the offseason, potential draft targets for each day of the draft, a mock draft tracker and historic tendencies for each general manager.",
      "The site was created in less than three weeks from idea to the execution with help from Amazon QuickSight, building on the work the NextGen Stats team did in creating Combine IQ, which provided context and comparisons to the loads of data produced at the annual scouting combine.",
      "Band has been posting potential first-round targets for teams for the past six years and has had a high rate with about three-quarters of the teams taking one of his potential targets.",
      "That work used from looking at team needs, draft history, mock drafts, pre-draft meetings and other information leads to the potential targets on the Draft IQ site for each team for each day. Those will be updated throughout the draft based on who's left on the board and what needs have been met.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun exercise to try to match these teams to players across different pre-draft interests, team needs,\u201d Band said. \u201cA lot of teams have a lot of smoke screens, so you almost have to read between the lines in a lot ways.\u201d",
      "The team pages include tendencies for general managers, including how often they have traded up or down, whether they target certain positions in the prime rounds and if the GM has had patterns based on size, age or other attributes when picking players.",
      "For example, Houston\u2019s Nick Caserio has used 31 of his 32 picks on players who came out of power conferences. The Bengals also tend to go that direction with all 22 of their picks in the first two rounds since 2014 coming from power conference schools.",
      "Philadelphia\u2019s Howie Roseman has used 10 of his 13 first-round picks when running the draft on the trenches, while Detroit\u2019s Brad Holmes\u2019 picks have the highest average athleticism score from NGS since he took over in 2021.",
      "\u201cIf you want to know who the last few picks were you can go to the draft tracker on NFL(dot)com,\u201d Band said. \u201cBut if you want to go deeper into every pick as it\u2019s happening and trying to anticipate the next pick and you want to sound smart at an NFL draft party and tip the pick without actually talking to Ian Rapoport, then follow along with Draft IQ.\u201d",

      "Flagg had reclassified to get to Duke a year early, and his decision was expected all year, even as he generally declined to spell out plans about his professional future as the season pushed into March or mentioned how much fun he had playing in college.",
      "\u201cI mean, it's been an incredible year with a really great group of people,\" Flagg told the AP in March after winning national player of the year.",
      "The 6-foot-9, 205-pound forward from Newport, Maine, averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.4 steals to lead the Blue Devils in each category. He\u2019s a versatile threat who showed the ability to thrive as a scorer, playmaker and defender.",
      "\u201cHis highlights, his statistics, the ways he impacted the game on both ends of the floor, really in every category, was off the charts \u2014 as good of a freshman season that a guy has had here,\u201d Duke coach Jon Scheyer said in a social media video from the program about Flagg's NBA declaration.",

      "The statistical highlight came when Flagg scored 42 points to set an Atlantic Coast Conference freshman record against Notre Dame in January, along with having 30 points, six rebounds and seven assists to help Duke hold off Arizona in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. There were plenty of impressive single plays, too, that demanded highlight-reel placement like his transition dunk through a defender against Pittsburgh in January.",
      "Flagg closed with 27 points and seven rebounds in a loss to Houston in the national semifinals. The Blue Devils had led by 14 with about 8 1/2 minutes left but faltered late, with Houston scoring the game\u2019s last nine points in the final 33 seconds and Flagg missing a late shot for the lead.",
      "Still, he was an elite and hypercompetitive force for one of college basketball\u2019s top teams all season with a game far more advanced than his age, capable of making an impact from baseline to baseline and sideline to sideline. He won't turn 19 until December, which would be roughly two months into his rookie season.",

      "ROME -- From meetings with Diego Maradona to the passion for his beloved Buenos Aires club, San Lorenzo, Pope Francis was an avid soccer fan. And a promoter of sports in general.",
      "Francis died Monday at 88 and the soccer and sports world immediately paid homage.",
      "All sports events scheduled for Monday in Italy were postponed to mourn Francis, including four top-flight soccer matches. A minute of silence will be observed before all sports events later in the week, the Italian Olympic Committee added.",
      "\u201cItalian soccer joins in the mourning of millions of people following the death of Pope Francis. He was a great example of Christian caring and dignity in the face of suffering and he was always attentive to the sports world and particularly soccer, of which he was a fan,\u201d said Italian soccer federation president Gabriele Gravina. \u201cHe will always remain in the hearts of the faithful and lovers of soccer.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 passion for soccer became known almost immediately after he was elected pope in 2013 when San Lorenzo tweeted a photo of him holding up the club\u2019s crest. He was even a card-carrying member of the club, with San Lorenzo ID No. 88,235.",
      "San Lorenzo is nicknamed \u201cthe Saints.\u201d",
      "In Italy, there were also suggestions that Francis supported Juventus since his family came from the Piedmont region where the Turin club is based. Francis' father, Mario Bergoglio, was a basketball player.",
      "San Lorenzo, one of the oldest teams in the Argentine Football Association, performed well after Francis was elected as the 266th pope in March 2013. The team won a national title in 2013 and then claimed the South American Copa Libertadores for the first time a year later. Club officials traveled twice to the Vatican carrying trophies to thank Francis for his support.",
      "A planned new San Lorenzo stadium is to be named for Francis.",
      "Francis met his fellow Argentine Maradona twice as pope. There was a special audience in connection with a charity soccer match in 2014 when Maradona presented the pontiff with a soccer jersey, emblazoned with the name \u201cFrancisco\u201d \u2014 Spanish for Francis \u2014 and Maradona\u2019s No. 10.",
      "\u201cI think we all now realize he\u2019s a (star),\u201d Maradona said after another meeting in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m Francis\u2019 top fan.\u201d",
      "When Maradona died in 2020, Francis remembered the soccer great in his prayers.",
      "Record 15-time European soccer champion Real Madrid also mourned Francis in a message on Instagram:",
      "\u201cReal Madrid would like to express its condolences to the entire Catholic community on the loss of a historic and universal figure,\u201d Real Madrid said in a statement. \u201cDuring his pontificate, characterised by the scale of his immense legacy, Pope Francis has represented an enormous spirit of solidarity and support for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "During a meeting with the Argentina and Italy national teams shortly after he was elected, Francis noted the influence of athletes, especially on youth, and told the players to remember that, \u201cfor better or worse\u201d they are role models. \u201cDear players, you are very popular. People follow you, and not just on the field but also off it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a social responsibility.\u201d",
      "Francis often hailed sports as a way to promote solidarity and inclusion, especially for young people.",
      "During a global conference on faith and sport in 2016, Francis implored leaders to do a better job of keeping corruption off the playing field and said sports must be protected from manipulations and commercial abuse.",
      "\u201cFrancis was a special pope, able to illuminate in his time like only the greatest can,\u201d Gianluigi Buffon, the former captain of Italy\u2019s national soccer team who met the pope on multiple occasions, said on Instagram. \u201cHe showed us the way with great courage and moved our souls. I will carry his example forever in my heart.\u201d",

The teams both went 50-32 in the regular season, when they split their four meetings, and was almost nothing between them in Game 1. The Clippers made two more field goals and had one more assist, while the Nuggets outrebounded them by one.

      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The State Bar of California has disclosed that some multiple-choice questions in a problem-plagued bar exam were developed with the aid of artificial intelligence.",
      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cWe have confidence in the validity of the (multiple-choice questions) to accurately and fairly assess the legal competence of test-takers,\u201d Leah Wilson, the State Bar\u2019s executive director, told the newspaper in a statement.",
      "Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, \u201cIt\u2019s a staggering admission.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "Former employees of OpenAI are asking the top law enforcement officers in California and Delaware to stop the company from shifting control of its artificial intelligence technology from a nonprofit charity to a for-profit business.",
      "They\u2019re concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harms.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",
      "OpenAI said in response that \u201cany changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.\u201d It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.",
      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",
      "\u201cIf OpenAI is allowed to become a for-profit, these safeguards, and OpenAI\u2019s duty to the public can vanish overnight,\u201d Tondwalkar said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Another former worker who signed the letter puts it more bluntly.",
      "\u201cOpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed,\" said Nisan Stiennon, an AI engineer who worked at OpenAI from 2018 to 2020. \"It is to OpenAI\u2019s credit that it\u2019s controlled by a nonprofit with a duty to humanity. This duty precludes giving up that control.\u201d",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry\u2019s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn\u2019t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House less than 100 days ago",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",
      "It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when they assembled behind Trump as he was sworn in.",
      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s policies so far have vexed Big Tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies \u2014 a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.",
      "Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations that Meta has been running an illegal monopoly in social networking, and working to persuade a federal judge to break up Google after its search engine last year was found to be illegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobble Apple and Amazon.",
      "And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company to record a $5.5 billion charge to account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country.",
      "Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies\u2019 financial reports for the January-March quarter.",
      "The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the same time last year.",
      "The decline occurred against a backdrop of vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies.",
      "After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1.",
      "Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",

      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

    "story": [
      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

    "story": [
      "The magma cap is critical for preventing eruptions at Yellowstone.",
      "Geoscientists have discovered a magma cap at Yellowstone National Park that is likely playing a critical role in preventing a massive eruption in one of the largest active volcanic systems in the world.",
      "The \"volatile rich\" cap made of magma is about 2.4 miles below the Earth's surface and essentially acts as a lid -- trapping pressure and heat below it, according to the team of researchers that uncovered it.",
      "It was found after scientists used a 53,000-pound vibroseis truck to generate tiny earthquakes that send seismic waves into the ground, according to the paper, published last week in Nature. The waves measured reflected off subsurface layers, revealing a sharp boundary at the depth where the magma cap lies.",
      "The scientists were surprised to see \"something physically happening\" at that depth, said Brandon Schmandt, professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice University and co-author of the study, in a statement.",
      "The stability of hazardous volcanic systems is \"strongly influenced\" by the uppermost magma storage depth, according to the paper. In addition, the magma reservoir at the upper crust beneath Yellowstone's caldera has not been well constrained, the researchers said.",
      "\"For decades, we\u2019ve known there\u2019s magma beneath Yellowstone, but the exact depth and structure of its upper boundary has been a big question,\" Schmandt said. \"What we\u2019ve found is that this reservoir hasn\u2019t shut down \u2014 it\u2019s been sitting there for a couple million years, but it\u2019s still dynamic.\"",
      "In 2022, researchers discovered that Yellowstone's supervolcano has substantially more magma reservoir under the caldera than previously thought. The lava is also flowing at shallow depths that fueled prior eruption.",
      "The researchers modeled various rock, melt and volatile conditions to determine what materials the magma cap consists of -- a mixture of silicate melt and supercritical water bubbles within porous rock. The bubbles are formed as the magma rises and decompresses, causing gases like water and carbon dioxide to separate from the melt.",
      "Volcanic eruptions can then occur as the bubbles accumulate and increase in buoyancy, driving an explosion.",
      "However, an eruption at Yellowstone is likely not imminent, the researchers said.",
      "Data from seismic imaging and advanced computer modeling indicates that the magma reservoir is actively releasing gas but remains in a stable state. The system was described by Schmandt as \"steady breathing,\" with the bubbles rising and releasing through the porous rock of the magma cap.",
      "\"Although we detected a volatile-rich layer, its bubble and melt contents are below the levels typically associated with imminent eruption,\" Schmandt said. \"Instead, it looks like the system is efficiently venting gas through cracks and channels between mineral crystals.\"",
      "Yellowstone's complex geology proved to be a challenging environment to obtain the data, the researchers said. The scattering seismic waves produced noisy data that was hard to interpret.",
      "\"When you see noisy, challenging data, don\u2019t give up,\" Chenlong Duan, a co-author on the study, said.",
      "The geoscientists were able to capture one of the first \"super clear\" images of the top of the magma reservoir beneath the Yellowstone caldera using the structural seismic imaging technique, said Duan, who developed the technique.",
      "The discovery could offer clues to future activity amid Yellowstone's extensive volcanic system, the researchers said.",

    "summary": "A federal judge on Wednesday found the U.S. government liable to the state of North Dakota for more than $28 million in the state's lawsuit for recouping millions of dollars for policing the protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday found the U.S. government liable to the state of North Dakota for more than $28 million in the state's lawsuit for recouping millions of dollars for policing the protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A federal judge on Wednesday found the state of North Dakota entitled to nearly $28 million for responding to protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 a win for the state in its multiyear effort to recoup the costs from the federal government.",
      "The state filed the lawsuit in 2019, seeking $38 million for policing the protests. The sometimes-chaotic demonstrations drew international attention for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline\u2019s Missouri River crossing upstream of the tribe\u2019s reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline, fearing an oil spill polluting its water supply.",
      "A trial played out over several weeks in early 2024 in federal court in Bismarck, the state capital. People who testified included former North Dakota governors Doug Burgum, who took office in December 2016 during the protests\u2019 height, and Jack Dalrymple, whose administration responded to the protests\u2019 early months.",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor found the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers liable to the state on all claims and for more than $27.8 million in damages.",
      "The judge wrote: \u201cThe bottom line: United States had a mandatory procedure, it did not follow that procedure, and harm occurred to the state of North Dakota. The law allows reimbursement for this harm. More than that, the rule of law requires this Court to hold the United States liable to remind it of its role in the larger picture of ensuring peace, not chaos.\u201d",
      "Thousands of people camped and demonstrated against the pipeline near the crossing for months. Hundreds of arrests resulted. Sometimes-violent clashes occurred between protesters and law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers from around the state and region responded to the protests.",
      "\u201cIt was a violent, unlawful protest. And \u2018protest\u2019 is a gentle word,\u201d North Dakota Attorney Drew Wrigley said last year before trial.",
      "The protest camps were cleared in February 2017. An attorney for the state said the protests ended in a response of more than seven months involving 178 agencies, resulting in 761 arrests and requiring four days of cleanup of the camp to remove millions of pounds of trash.",
      "\u201cAlthough the unlawful protest was burgeoning before everyone's eyes and the damages and dangers were so apparent, the federal government refused to offer assistance and enforce the legal obligations on the people who were encamped,\" Wrigley said.",
      "Attorneys for the government said at trial that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials \u201cacted reasonably given limited options at their disposal\u201d during the protests, and that the state's claim is \u201cgreatly overstated.\" The government asked the judge to find a lack of legal jurisdiction for the state's claims, that the state hasn't proven its claims and is not entitled to damages.",
      "The pipeline has been transporting oil since June 2017. Many state government officials and industry leaders support the pipeline as crucial infrastructure in the country\u2019s No. 3 oil-producing state. The pipeline carries roughly 5% of the United States' daily oil production.",
      "In 2017, the pipeline company, Energy Transfer, donated $15 million to help cover the response costs. That same year, the U.S. Justice Department gave a $10 million grant to the state for reimbursing the response. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how that amount affected the damages.",
      "Then-President Donald Trump denied a 2017 request from the state for the federal government to cover the costs through a disaster declaration.",
      "The pipeline is operating while a court-ordered environmental review of the river crossing is carried out.",
      "A North Dakota jury recently found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims brought by the pipeline's builder in connection with protest activities, with damages surpassing $660 million for three Greenpeace organizations.",

      "She added, \"It took everything in my power to not do the thing that was perceived as right, but do the things that [were] for me -- that was a hard thing for me to do.\"",
      "To help herself follow through, Obama admitted she had to \"basically trick\" herself by refusing to prepare for the event.",
      "\"It started with not having anything to wear,\" she said. \"I mean, I had affirmatively -- because I am always prepared for any funeral, anything. I walk around with the right dress, I travel with clothes just in case something pops off. So I was like, if I am not going to do this thing, I got to tell my team, I don't even want to have a dress ready.\"",

      "The former first lady also shared that part of her motivation was to set an example for her daughters Malia Obama, 26, and Sasha Obama, 23, whom she shares with her husband, former President Barack Obama.",
      "\"I want them to start practicing now the art of saying 'no,'\" she said. \"Because I see it in them, pleasing, excelling, not wanting to take anything for granted, always showing gratitude, feeling like they're enough right now, right? It's a practice. It's a muscle that you have to build, because if you don't constantly build it, you don't develop it.\"",

      "\"So much so that this year, people were -- they couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing,\" she said at the time.",
      "\"This couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right? But that's what society does to us. We start actually finally going, 'What am I doing? Who am I doing this for?'\" she continued. \"And if it doesn't fit into the sort of stereotype of what people think we should do, then it gets labeled as something negative and horrible.\"",

      "Amid a tense legal battle over deportations, President Donald Trump is now arguing undocumented migrants should not be given a trial where they could challenge being removed from the country.",
      "\"We're getting them out, and I hope we get cooperation from the courts because you know, we have thousands of people that are ready to go out, and you can't have a trial for all of these people,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday.",
      "\"It wasn't meant, the system wasn't meant -- and we don't think there is anything that says -- Look, we are getting some very bad people, killers, murderers, drug dealers, really bad people, the mentally ill, the mentally insane, they emptied out insane asylums into our country, we're getting them out,\" Trump continued. \"And a judge can't say, 'No, you have to have a trial.'\"",
      "\"No, we are going to have a very dangerous country if we are not allowed to do what we are entitled to do,\" Trump added.",
      "Trump made a similar argument in a post to his conservative social media platform, contending they can't give everyone they want to deport a trial because it would \"take, without exaggeration, 200 years.\"",
      "\"Such a thing is not possible to do,\" he wrote.",
      "The comments came after the Supreme Court, in a brief order issued early Saturday morning, temporarily blocked the administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,\" the justices said. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.",

      "The American Civil Liberties Union had appealed to the nation's high court to stop the migrants being held in a Texas detention center from being removed, contending they were at risk of being deported \"without notice or an opportunity to be heard\" -- a breach, they said, of the Supreme Court's previous order that detainees are entitled to \"reasonable time\" to seek relief.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt in a statement after the Supreme Court's order. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "Also front and center of Trump's deportation effort is the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant living in Maryland who was erroneously deported to El Salvador's infamous CECOT mega-prison.",
      "Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended Abrego Garcia's removal, telling ABC's \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl they \"did the right thing\" and \"removed a public safety threat.\" The administration's alleged Abrego Garcia is member of the MS-13 gang, which his attorneys and family deny.",
      "Democrats have criticized Trump's actions in the case as violating due process rights. Sen. Chris Van Hollen was the first Democratic lawmaker to visit El Salvador, where he met with Garcia, last week. Several House Democrats were in El Salvador on Monday to advocate for his release.",
      "\u201cWhile Donald Trump continues to defy the Supreme Court, Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being held illegally in El Salvador after being wrongfully deported,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia. \u201cThat is why we\u2019re here -- to remind the American people that kidnapping immigrants and deporting them without due process is not how we do things in America.\"",

      "Several lobbyists who helped Donald Trump raise campaign and inaugural funds are now making an unprecedented amount of money on corporate lobbying -- profiting off of major corporations' efforts to gain favor with the Trump administration in its second term, financial disclosures show.",
      "From Blue Origin and Palantir to Nasdaq and the NFL, hundreds of major companies have been flocking to the firms of lobbyists Brian Ballard and Jeff Miller as the two companies bolster their standing as the Trump administration's power brokers.",
      "Ballard Partners, the firm of Florida-based fundraiser and longtime Trump ally Brian Ballard, made $14.3 million in federal lobbying income just in the first three months of this year, according to lobbying disclosures. At that rate, the company is on track to potentially triple or even quadruple the roughly $19 million it made from federal lobbying in all of 2024.",
      "Ballard Partners, which had already made its name as an ally of Trump during his first Trump presidency, has signed more than 100 new federal lobbying clients since November, according to filings.",
      "During the presidency of Joe Biden, the lobbying business of Jeff Ricchetti, the brother of then-White House Counselor Steven Ricchetti, thrived in a similar manner, picking up major clients like Amazon and TC Energy and more than doubling its lobbying income in 2021 compared to the year before.",
      "But Ballard Partners and Jeff Miller's firm, Miller Strategies, have expanded even faster, with new Ballard clients including Netflix, American Express and JP Morgan, on top of the NFL and Blue Origin.",
      "The data analytics company Palantir hired both Ballard and Miller's firms earlier this year as Palantir CEO Alex Karp -- once a vocal Trump critic and a Democrat -- has been boosting Trump with a hefty political donation and supportive public comments on Elon Musk and his government-slashing efforts. Karp's company has also reportedly received an increased number of federal contracts under Trump's presidency.",
      "Also among Ballard's new clients are blockchain company Ripple Labs, which hired Ballard just days after Trump's November victory and later gave nearly $5 million in contributions to the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee; crypto exchange platform Kraken's parent company Payward, which also gave $1 million to the inaugural committee; and crypto exchange company Blockchain.com.",
      "Ballard was also hired by TikTok last September as that company sought to maintain its U.S. footprint amid calls to ban the service. Ballard has also lobbied for the Chinese clothing retail company Shein since May of last year.",
      "Separately, Ballard's firm also represents the Embassy of the Republic of Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to foreign lobbying disclosures.",
      "Headed by Jeff Miller, who served as a finance chair on Trump's second inaugural committee and was previously former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's fundraiser, Miller Strategies took in nearly $9 million in just the first three months of this year, which was on track to dwarf the roughly $12 million his firm brought in from federal lobbying during all of 2024.",
      "Miller has signed at least 55 new clients since Trump's reelection according to filings, including OpenAI and Nasdaq, as well as Softbank Group, the Japanese company that announced a $100 million investment in the U.S. during a press conference with Trump in December.",
      "Other lobbyists that recently raised money for Trump and are now enjoying success include Akin Gump's Geoff Verhoff, who brought in $3.4 million during 2025's first three months, and Brownstein Hyatt's Marc Lampkin, who took in $3 million.",
      "Verhoff's single biggest client is Nippon Steel, which so far this year has paid Akin Gump nearly $1.7 million amid the ongoing merger negotiations between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel.",
      "Lampkin's biggest client is Tencent America LLC, an American arm of the Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent, which owns the major Chinese messaging apps WeChat and QQ.",

You heard me also say in the beginning that a lot of us have been advised not to have these town meetings because it gives a forum for people to exert disagreement,\" Grassley says. \"Sometimes very strong disagreement with what's going on in Washington.\"",
      "Republican leaders have suggested that members avoid in-person town halls after several incidents with angry audience members earlier this year.",

      "\"In my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch,\" Durbin said in the video. \"The threats to our democracy and way of life are real, and I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.\"",
      "Durbin, 80, has served in the Senate since 1997 and won reelection to the Senate four times. Coupled with his time in the House, Durbin has served in Congress for 44 years.",
      "\"We are also fortunate to have a strong Democratic bench ready to serve,\" Durbin said in the video. \"We need them now more than ever.\"",

      "A day after a federal judge ordered the government to more fully answer questions about the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration, in a sealed motion Wednesday, asked the judge to pause discovery for seven days.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who last week slammed Justice Department attorneys over their inaction over Abrego Garcia's wrongful detention and ordered government officials to testify under oath through expedited discovery, ordered the government Tuesday to more fully answer and respond by Wednesday evening to discovery requests from Abrego Garcia's attorneys.",
      "\"Given that this Court expressly warned Defendants and their counsel to adhere strictly to their discovery obligations ... their boilerplate, non-particularized objections are presumptively invalid and reflect a willful refusal to comply with this Court's Discovery Order and governing rules,\" Xinis wrote Tuesday.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who has been living with his wife and children in Maryland, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13.",

    "story": [
      "The agencies aim to remove the dyes by the end of next year.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday a series of measures to phase out eight artificial food dyes and colorings from America's food supply by the end of next year.",
      "Speaking at a news conference, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agencies will work with food companies to remove dyes from products.",
      "\"I just want to urge all of you, it's not the time to stop; it's the time to redouble your efforts, because we have them on the run now, and we are going to win this battle,\" Kennedy told a crowd of \"Make America Healthy Again\" supporters during the news conference. \"And four years from now, we're going to have most of these products off the market, or you will know about them when you go to the grocery store.\"",
      "At the news conference, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the agencies are looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and to work with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in cereal, ice cream, snacks, yogurts and more.",
      "\"Today, the FDA is taking action to remove petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S. food supply and from medications. For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,\" he told reporters.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration in January started the process to ban one artificial dye, Red No. 3, which will need to be removed from food by January 2027 and from medications by 2028 because it was shown to cause cancer in rats. The FDA said Tuesday it is requesting food companies to speed up the removal of Red. No. 3.",
      "Federal officials are taking steps to pull the authorization for two rarely used synthetic food colorings -- Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B -- within the coming months. In addition, the six other petroleum-based dyes that federal health agencies are seeking to eliminate by the end of next year are Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1 and Blue No. 2.",
      "The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives, officials announced Tuesday.",
      "Kennedy: 'We have an understanding' with food companies",
      "The plan, however, is contingent on an \"understanding\" with major food companies that they will voluntarily remove them to meet consumer demand, Kennedy said Tuesday.",
      "HHS and FDA are calling on the food industry to \"establish a national standard and timeline ... to transition from petrochemical-based dyes to natural alternatives,\" according to a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon.",
      "It is not yet clear what enforcement mechanism Kennedy will seek to implement the new changes.",
      "When asked if food companies, which were not present at the news conference, would follow the suggested changes, Kennedy said: \"We don't have an agreement; we have an understanding.\"",
      "Makary, the head of the FDA, went on to say that the agency plans to work with the food industry instead of having Congress step in. \"We've had wonderful meetings with the food industry,\" he said. \"They are eager to do it.\"",
      "Speaking with ABC News after the announcement, Makary maintained the administration would meet its \"bold goal\" despite no immediate plans for new regulations to force the move.",
      "\"There's no need to have a regulation or a statute when companies are volunteering to do it,\" Makary said. \"We are going to use every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done to the best of our abilities.\"",
      "But the International Association of Color Manufacturers, the trade association for the color additives industry, which includes both natural and synthetic dyes, issued a statement after the news conference questioning the proposed timeline.",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. This process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the group said in the statement.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, however, which represents makers of packaged foods and beverages, indicated its members would work with the administration to take action on food dye priorities, citing the difficulty in adhering to a \"patchwork\" of differing state laws.",
      "\"Consumer Brands has long asked HHS and FDA to reestablish themselves as the country's leading regulatory authority and we appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership in response to the myriad of state activity in the food regulation space,\" said CBA President Melissa Hockstad in a statement following Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Memo reveals food companies willing to voluntarily remove dyes",
      "The proposed timeline to phase out synthetic dyes laid out Tuesday comes after Kennedy told food industry leaders at a meeting last month that he wanted their companies to remove artificial dyes from their products by the end of his four-year term, according to a memo describing the meeting, which was obtained by ABC News.",
      "Days after that meeting, which included executives from PepsiCo and General Mills, the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would be willing to voluntarily make the changes sought by Kennedy, according to a March 20 memo sent to HHS officials obtained by ABC News.",
      "The two-page proposal lays out commitments the food companies were willing to make \u2014 including efforts within 30 days to start reformulating foods to remove artificial dyes.",
      "The memo did not contain an explicit commitment to remove all artificial dyes by the end of 2026, as Kennedy called for on Tuesday, but the proposal said CBA members were committed to \"supporting agency actions.\"",
      "The proposal also outlined a commitment for companies to supply food for school lunches that does not include artificial dyes or coloring.",
      "In return for working to remove dyes from food, the trade group asked the Trump administration to work against state legislation that has created a patchwork of laws around food dyes \u2014 which could lead to more restrictive bans on other chemicals -- not just food dyes -- in certain states.",
      "\"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy need to communicate with governors and state legislatures that the administration is taking bold, transformative actions and continued activity at the state level stands to undermine the President's leadership and to increase costs to consumers,\" the trade group wrote in the memo. \"A federal solution is meaningless under a state patchwork regime.\"",
      "Already, red and blue states alike have taken matters into their own hands in removing artificial food dyes from certain foods. Both West Virginia and California have passed laws to ban a handful of food dyes from school lunches, with plans to extend the ban to a broader, statewide level too.",
      "In West Virginia, the ban on artificial dyes in school lunch will go into effect in August, making it the first state in the country to implement such restraints. In California, it will take effect in 2028.",
      "Twenty-six other states, from Iowa to Washington and from to Texas to Vermont, are considering similar legislation around banning food dyes or other chemical additives in foods, according to a list compiled by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that focuses on chemicals and toxins.",
      "What are the health risks?",
      "From candy to breakfast cereal to medication, synthetic food dyes are in a wide range of products that Americans consume. Studies suggest their vibrant color makes food more appealing and could even increase appetite.",
      "Makary claimed studies have found a link between petroleum-based synthetic dyes and health conditions, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obesity, diabetes, cancer and gastrointestinal issues.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble?\" he said. \"While America's children are sick and suffering, 41% of children have at least one health condition, and one in five are on medication. The answer is not more Ozempic, more ADHD medication and more antidepressants. There's a role for those medications, but we have to look at underlying root causes.\"",
      "But scientists caution the evidence for health risks are not that clear.",
      "\"There are animal studies that show that food dyes have been associated to outcomes such as cancer,\" said ABC New Medical Correspondent Dr. Darien Sutton. \"But the FDA maintains that these studies have not shown sufficient evidence that that harm could be effected in humans.\"",
      "All dyes have the potential to spark allergic reactions for a small minority. Several dyes have been linked to hyperactivity and behavioral problems in children or have been shown to cause cancer in mice or rats -- but none have shown to cause cancer in humans.",
      "\"When you look at the overall evidence it is difficult to see a clear cause and effect, but if there's no clear benefit when adding something like a food additive other than making food look better, then many argue let's just simply take it out,\" Sutton said.",
      "While the health effects of the dyes are not fully understood, many other countries have either banned the additives outright or required food packaging warning labels about the health risks.",

      "HHS and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and to work with food manufacturers to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in foods such as cereal, snacks, ice creams and yogurts.",
      "Kennedy has previously been vocal about his opposition to artificial dyes, claiming they are harmful and calling for them to be removed from foods and beverages.",
      "Studies have linked dyes to behavioral changes as well as to cancer in animals, suggesting this may extend to humans.",
      "Some nutritionists and dietitians say that it's best to avoid artificial food dyes, while others say more research needs to be done and the potential negative effects are still unclear.",
      "What are synthetic dyes and where are they found?",
      "Many years ago, some synthetic dyes were produced from by-products of coal processing, according to the FDA. Today, many dyes are petroleum-based and made through chemical processes.",
      "They appear in many different types of foods including candies, ice cream, frozen desserts, crackers, chips, energy bars, cereals, beverages and more.",
      "Halle Saperstein, a clinical dietitian at Henry Ford Health in Detroit, told ABC News her research has found there are about 36,000 products with Red No. 40, about 8,000 products that contain Red No. 3 and about one in 10 products that contain another type of synthetic food dye.",
      "\"The other thing to note is that many products contain multiple petroleum food dyes, not just one specific one,\" she said.",
      "Sandra Zhang, a registered dietician nutritionist and pediatric dietitian at the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said synthetic dyes are very prevalent and are mostly used in packaged, processed foods that can be found in supermarkets and grocery stores.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are not found in nature, so they are man-made entirely,\" Zhang said. \"And so, they have no nutritional properties or benefits whatsoever. They are made only to enhance the appearance of foods.\"",
      "What have studies shown?",
      "Research has suggested that some synthetic food dyes may be associated with behavioral issues in children and teenagers.",
      "A 2012 meta-analysis from Oregon Health and Science University found artificial food colors may affect children's behavior and exacerbate symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",
      "Another 2012 study found artificial food coloring is not a major cause of ADHD but can affect children whether or not they are diagnosed with the condition.",
      "Additionally, a 2022 analysis from the California Environmental Protection Agency and two California universities found that there may be an association between synthetic food dyes and behavioral issues even children without a diagnosed behavioral disorder.",
      "In 2019, the FDA said an advisory committee did not establish a \"causal link\" between synthetic color additives and behavioral effects, but did recommend further research on the issue.",
      "Are synthetic food dyes safe?",
      "Experts are divided on the issue. Saperstein said she sees a credible link between behavior and synthetic food dye consumption based on the studies she's read.",
      "Zhang said she's not sure if there's a link between behavioral issues and synthetic food dyes and that more research needs to be done.",
      "\"At least from my patient care experience, I'm not observing ... a kid consuming Gatorade every day makes a huge difference\" in their behavior, she said.",
      "She added, however, that scientific research linking dyes to neurobehavioral changes was done on animals.",
      "Whether or not synthetic dyes are safe to consume, experts agree it is best to limit artificial food coloring consumption when possible.",
      "Jennifer Pomeranz, an associate professor of public health policy and management at NYU School of Global Public Health, said she believes there is no need for artificial food dyes in the food supply because they don't act as preservatives and they don't have any nutritional benefits.",
      "\"There are natural dyes that [companies] can use,\" she said. \"And frankly, there's really no need for such a brightly colored food supply.\"",
      "Earlier this year, under the administration of former President Joe Biden, the FDA said it was moving to ban the use of Red No. 3 in foods, beverages and medications after it was found to cause cancer in rats.",
      "On the heels of Kennedy's Tuesday announcement about eliminating other synthetic dyes, the International Association of Color Manufacturers, the trade association for the color additives industry, released a statement criticizing the HHS decision.",
      "\"Color additives have been rigorously reviewed by global health authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Food Safety Authority, and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, with no safety concerns,\" the statement read. \"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production\"",
      "What about natural alternatives?",
      "During Tuesday's press conference, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary mentioned watermelon juice and carrot juice as natural alternatives to synthetic dyes.",
      "Some food manufacturers use concentrated forms of natural pigments found in fruits and plants -- such as beets, blackberries, paprika, saffron, tamarind and turmeric -- as dyes.",
      "As the food industry shifts to natural dyes, more research should be done to study their safety and to formulate regulations on the concentration levels, Zhang said.",
      "The FDA said on Tuesday it is fast-tracking the review of four new natural color additives: calcium phosphate, Galdieria extract blue, gardenia blue and butterfly pea flower extract.",
      "Gardenia blue and butterfly pea flower extract come from plants, Galdieria extract blue comes from algae and calcium phosphate is a chemical compound.",
      "Expert say food companies use synthetic dyes to color their products because they are cheaper compared to natural dyes. Some companies have stated their products are safe for consumption, and they are following federal standards set by the FDA.",
      "Saperstein said another reason companies might use synthetic dyes is psychological, because people are more drawn to brightly colored foods than foods with muted colors.",
      "\"We've seen stories of companies switching [to natural dyes] and they feel it's not bright enough, so they switch back,\" Pomeranz said.",

      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage visits.",

      "The tax charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans will pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and near St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "The amount in euros that the city of Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials say 8,000 day-trippers paid in advance to enter the city on Friday, among the 77,000 who have already registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",

      "The company that owned the railcar that caused the devastating East Palestine train derailment in 2023 won't have to help pay for the $600 million settlement Norfolk Southern agreed to with residents",
      "The company that owned the railcar that caused the devastating East Palestine train derailment in 2023 won't have to help pay for the $600 million settlement Norfolk Southern agreed to with residents.",
      "An Ohio jury decided Wednesday that GATX isn't liable for the settlement even though the failure of a bearing on its railcar carrying plastic pellets caused the pileup on Feb. 3, 2023. GATX has maintained Norfolk Southern operated and inspected the train and all the cars and was responsible for delivering the cargo safely.",
      "\u201cGATX is pleased with the trial outcome, which affirms what we have known for some time: Norfolk Southern alone is responsible for the derailment and resulting damage in East Palestine,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "Norfolk Southern called the verdict disappointing but said it won't affect the railroad's commitments to everyone affected by the derailment.",
      "\u201cFor more than two years, Norfolk Southern has paid the costs related to the derailment while acknowledging and acting on our own responsibility for the accident. Our belief has always been that other companies, like GATX, who share in that responsibility should also be held to account,\u201d the railroad said in a statement.",
      "After the train derailed in East Palestine, an assortment of chemicals spilled and caught fire. Then three days later, officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride because they feared those cars might explode, generating a massive black plume of smoke that spread over the area and forcing evacuations.",
      "Norfolk Southern lost a similar lawsuit last year when it tried to force GATX and OxyVinyls, which made the vinyl chloride, to help pay for the environmental cleanup after the derailment that has cost the Atlanta-based railroad more than $1 billion. It made similar arguments in this trial.",
      "These lawsuits have no effect on how much money residents or the village of East Palestine will receive from their settlements with the railroad. This cases only affect which company writes the check.",
      "Last week, OxyVinyls agreed to a settlement with Norfolk Southern in this lawsuit over the class-action settlement after the railroad's lawyers raised questions about the inconsistent information the chemical company provided about whether it was necessary to perform the vent-and-burn operation and release the vinyl chloride. The details of that settlement weren't released.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed in its investigation that the vent-and-burn operation was unnecessary because the tank cars were starting to cool off and the railroad failed to listen to the advice from OxyVinyls\u2019 experts or share their opinions with the officials who made the decision.",
      "The railroad said GATX should have done more to take care of its railcar, particularly after it was surrounded by floodwaters, which could have damaged its bearings.",
      "But GATX said it complied with all the relevant regulations for taking care of its railcars. The company said that even if the car was damaged six years earlier by standing parked in the middle of floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey, the railroad should have spotted the problem and repaired it, sending GATX the bill for the repairs.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said the crash was caused by the failure of an overheating bearing on GATX\u2019s railcar. The railroad\u2019s sensors spotted the bearing starting to heat up in the miles before the derailment, but it didn\u2019t reach a critical temperature and trigger an alarm until just before the derailment. That left the crew little time to stop the train.",

      "Gov. Gavin Newsom's office announced Wednesday that 1,000 zero-emission school buses and related charging infrastructure will be provided to over 130 rural, low-income and disadvantaged school districts. The state grants add about 500 more charging stations for school buses to more than 200 stations already in operation in districts.",
      "The expansion contrasts efforts in other states that were hampered by the uncertainity over federal funds. For months, m ore than 500 districts nationwide were waiting on around $1 billion from the Environmental Protection Agency to cover more than 3,400 electric buses, sparking panic and confusion. Some districts delayed or canceled their purchases.",
      "California has the largest fleet of electric school buses in the country after pumping more than $1.3 billion into such efforts and funding more than 2,300 of the buses. Of those, 1,100 are already in use and some districts are 100% electric.",
      "\u201cCalifornia is committed to continuing efforts to reduce children\u2019s exposure to toxic diesel pollution through the deployment of zero-emission school buses,\u201d Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, said in an email.

      "On the federal bench for nearly a decade, Xinis has experienced partisan pushback since her nomination by Democratic President Barack Obama. She also was accused of being too tough on law enforcement during earlier legal work for a police oversight office.",

      "Earlier this month, Xinis ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia's return. That decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court, although the justices said her order needed to be clarified to make sure it did not intrude upon executive branch power over foreign affairs.",
      "\u201cThe order properly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,\u201d the court said.",
      "The administration conceded it made a mistake in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. But it argued that it no longer could do anything about trying to bring him back. Officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, though he has never been charged with or convicted of a crime. His lawyers have said there is no evidence that he is a member of MS-13 or any gang.",
      "Last week, Xinis said that she would order sworn testimony by administration officials to determine whether they complied with her orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. She said officials had defied a \u201cclear\u201d Supreme Court order and that White House officials and El Salvador\u2019s president, in saying they were unable to bring him back, were like \u201ctwo very misguided ships passing in the night.\u201d",
      "In 2020, Xinis issued a preliminary injunction halting portions of immigration rules enacted under the first Trump administration that would have limited people seeking asylum in the U.S. from being able to obtain authorization to work.",

      "Obama nominated Xinis in March 2015 to the federal bench in Maryland, where the courts had declared a \u201cjudicial emergency\u201d due to the number of pending cases. The seat had been vacant since October 2014, with the Senate slowing its approval of judges nominated by a president of the opposing party in the later months of a president\u2019s final year in office.",
      "Xinis won support from Republican leaders, including the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. But some conservatives felt Xinis was too tough on law enforcement in her legal career. They cited her record as an examiner for the Office of Police Complaints in Washington, a civilian oversight entity.",
      "Her confirmation vote in May 2016 came shortly after then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., had noted that her law firm had represented the family of Freddie Gray, who died a year earlier after his neck was broken while he was handcuffed and shackled in the back of a Baltimore police van. Gray\u2019s death prompted riots in that city, and his case has been frequently mentioned in the national conversation about police brutality.",

      "Xinis was born in Mineola, New York, graduated from the University of Virginia and went to Yale Law School. She clerked for Judge Diana Gribbon Motz on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She was an assistant federal public defender in Maryland and adjunct professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.",

      "Harmony Montgomery wasn\u2019t made a priority in her own legal case, the report said, as neither the judge nor the attorneys put her medical, behavioral and educational needs or safety at the forefront of custody discussions. The report also said they did not enforce requirements that govern the placement of children from one state into another.",
      "Filmmaker Bill Lichtenstein, with the support of several media outlets including The Associated Press, sued to gain access to recordings of the closed-door custody hearing to better understand how Adam Montgomery got custody of his daughter, despite having a long criminal record. Normally, family court hearings are sealed due to privacy concerns.",
      "Lichtenstein says he wants the audio for a documentary about secrecy in Massachusetts\u2019 child protection and juvenile court systems.",

Adam Montgomery punched Harmony Montgomery at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant because he was angry that the child was having bathroom accidents in the car, she said.",
      "After that, she said she handed food to the children in the car without checking on Harmony and that the couple later discovered she was dead after the car broke down. She testified that her husband put the body in a duffel bag.

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked North Carolina election officials from contacting voters whose disputed ballots in an unresolved 2024 state Supreme Court race could be eliminated from the final count.",
      "In a 2-1 decision, a panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, granted the stay request of Democratic Associate Justice Allison Riggs, who has asked federal judges to throw out the recent rulings of state appellate courts that largely favored Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin's requests to toss ballots that he challenged.",
      "Democrats and voting rights groups have raised alarm about Griffin's effort, calling it an attack on democracy that would serve as a road map for the GOP to reverse future election results in other states. The state Republican Party says Griffin's efforts are about ensuring that only legal votes are counted.",
      "The court's decision late Tuesday means government election workers are prohibited \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from carrying out a process mandated by state judges who ruled earlier this month that voters within two categories were ineligible. Most of these military or overseas voters, once contacted formally, would get 30 days to provide additional identifying information so that their race choices would remain in the tally. Others, however, would be unable to \u201ccure\u201d their ineligibility and their ballots would be removed.",
      "Riggs leads Griffin by just 734 votes from more than 5.5 million ballots cast in what is the nation\u2019s last undecided race from November's general election. The stay keeps these numbers in place while Riggs and her allies seek a federal trial judge to declare it would be unlawful to remove any of these ballots from the totals.",
      "After two recounts appeared to confirm a Riggs victory, Griffin soon after the Nov. 5 election filed protests that grew to more than 65,000 ballots. Ensuing state court rulings whittled down the total to as few as 1,675 ballots or perhaps as much as 7,000, according to court filings. Actual totals are still being hashed out in state court. The fewer the ballots that could be potentially removed, the likely tougher it would be for Griffin to overtake Riggs.",
      "Attorneys for Riggs and other groups seeking Tuesday's stay told the 4th Circuit that without it, mailings going out soon to affected voters would only increase voter confusion, especially if federal courts later overturn the state court decision.",
      "Tuesday's prevailing order from U.S. Circuit Judges Paul Niemeyer and Toby Heytens said granting a stay was proper while U.S. District Judge Richard Myers rules on claims by Riggs, the State Board of Elections and others that the U.S. Constitution and federal voting laws prevent the ballots from being canceled.",
      "\u201cWe enjoin the North Carolina State Board of Elections from mailing any notice to any potentially affected voter pending the district court\u2019s resolution of Riggs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction,\u201d the order reads.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Marvin Quattlebaum Jr. said that Myers committed no error by simply ordering previously that the state board not certify any outcome in the race while he considers legal arguments. Quattlebaum was an appointee of President Donald Trump. Heytens and Niemeyer were appointed by Presidents Joe Biden and George H.W. Bush, respectively.",
      "Riggs campaign spokesperson Dory MacMillan said the motion pauses \u201ca confusing and burdensome cure process for ballots that had nothing wrong with them\" and \"we\u2019re confident that federal law prohibits these votes from being thrown out.\u201d",
      "Griffin's lawyers argued the stay request should have been denied and say federal courts should let stand state court decisions that remove votes from ineligible voters.",
      "\u201cWe expect the litigation of this case to continue for some time,\" Griffin campaign spokesperson Paul Shumaker said Wednesday. \"The ruling only further delays an outcome.\u201d",
      "One category of ballots that state appeals courts declared shouldn't be counted were cast by overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. but whose parents were declared North Carolina residents.",
      "The other disallowed category covers military or overseas voters who did not provide copies of photo identification or an ID exception form with their absentee ballots. Election officials have been told to notify these voters and tell them they could turn in an ID copy or exception form within 30 days for their vote to count.",
      "Griffin, who is a state Court of Appeals judge, and Riggs have not participated in deliberations in their respective courts about their election.",

      "MINEOLA, N.Y. -- A woman and her child whose remains were discovered scattered along an oceanfront highway not far from Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach were identified by police Wednesday, nearly three decades after they first went missing.",
      "Police in Nassau County said the mother, previously nicknamed \u201cPeaches\u201d by investigators after a tattoo on her body, had been identified as Tanya Denise Jackson, a U.S. army veteran who was 26 at the time of her death.",
      "Her 2-year-old daughter was identified as Tatiana Marie Dykes, investigators said. Both were living in Brooklyn, where Jackson may have worked as a medical assistant, according to police.",
      "At a briefing Wednesday, law enforcement officials said they had identified the victims of the long-unsolved killing through DNA evidence found at the scene and advanced genetic and genealogy research. They urged anyone who may have known the pair to contact police with information.",
      "\u201cThe reality is our work has just begun,\u201d Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly said. \u201cKnowing the identities of the mom and the little baby is just a first step to help us get to solving these murders.\u201d",
      "Some of the Jackson's remains were discovered on June 28, 1997, stuffed inside a plastic tub in a state park in West Hempstead on Long Island. More remains, and the skeletal remains of the female child, were found off Ocean Parkway in April 2011.",
      "Police have previously said they\u2019ve confirmed the two are related through DNA analysis.",
      "It has long been unclear whether there is any connection between \u201cPeaches\u201d and other women found slain elsewhere on Long Island. Since late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people \u2014 mostly female sex workers \u2014 whose remains were discovered there.",
      "Rex Heuermann, a Manhattan architect, has been charged in the deaths of seven women. He has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty to all counts. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAlthough Tanya and Tatiana have commonly been linked to the Gilgo Beach serial killings because the timing and locations of their recovered remains, we are not discounting the possibility that their cases are unrelated from that investigation,\" said Homicide Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick. \"Speculation and theories by people and on the internet should not be brought into this.\u201d",

      "In September, Long Island officials released more detailed renderings of a victim believed to be of Chinese descent whose remains were found off Ocean Parkway in 2011. The victim died in 2006 or earlier, was likely between ages 17 and 23 and about 5 feet 6 inches (170 centimeters) tall.",
      "Officials for years had identified the victim as male, but said they now believe the person may have presented outwardly as female as they were dressed in women\u2019s clothing.",

      "Now, his message is different.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d said Osborn, who owns Fox Run Vineyards, a sprawling 50-acre (20-hectare) farm on Seneca Lake, the largest of New York\u2019s Finger Lakes.",
      "It\u2019s becoming riskier to grow grapes in the state\u2019s prominent winemaking region. Harvests like Osborn\u2019s are increasingly endangered by unpredictable weather from climate change. Attitudes on wine are shifting. Political tensions, such as tariffs amid President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars and the administration\u2019s rollback of environmental policies, are also looming problems.",
      "Despite the challenges, however, many winegrowers are embracing sustainable practices, wanting to be part of the solution to global warming while hoping they can adapt to changing times.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and The Associated Press.",
      "___",
      "The Finger Lakes, which span a large area of western New York, have water that can sparkle and give off a sapphire hue on sunny days. More than 130 wineries dot the shorelines and offer some of America\u2019s most famous white wines.",
      "At Fox Run, visitors step inside to sip wines and bring a bottle \u2014 or two \u2014 home. Many are longtime customers, like Michele Magda and her husband, who have frequently made the trip from Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cThis is like a little escape, a little getaway,\u201d she said.",
      "Traditionally, the plants\u2019 buds break out in spring, emerging with colorful grapes that range from the cabernet franc\u2019s deep blues to the soft greens of the region\u2019s most popular grape, riesling. However, a warming world is making that happen earlier, adding to uncertainty and potential risks for farmers. If a frost comes after the buds have broken, growers can lose much of the harvest.",
      "Year-round rain and warmer night temperatures differentiate the Finger Lakes from its West Coast competitors, said Paul Brock, a viticulture and wine technology professor at Finger Lakes Community College. Learning to adapt to those fluctuations has given local winemakers a competitive advantage, he said.",
      "Globally, vineyards are grappling with the impacts of increasingly unpredictable weather. In France, record rainfall and harsh weather have spelled trouble for winegrowers trying their best to adapt. Along the West Coast, destructive wildfires are worsening wine quality.",
      "Many winegrowers say they are working to make their operations more sustainable, wanting to help solve climate change caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline, coal and natural gas.",
      "Farms can become certified under initiatives such as the New York Sustainable Winegrowing program. Fox Run and more than 50 others are certified, which requires that growers improve practices like bettering soil health and protecting water quality of nearby lakes.",
      "Beyond the rustic metal gate featuring the titular foxes, some of Osborn\u2019s sustainability initiatives come into view.",
      "Hundreds of solar panels powering 90% of the farm\u2019s electricity are the most obvious feature. Other initiatives are more subtle, like underground webs of fungi used to insulate crops from drought and disease.",
      "\u201cWe all have to do something,\u201d Osborn said.",
      "For Suzanne Hunt and her family\u2019s 7th-generation vineyard, doing something about climate change means devoting much of their efforts to sustainability.",
      "Hunt Country Vineyards, along Keuka Lake, took on initiatives like using underground geothermal pipelines for heating and cooling, along with composting. Despite the forward-looking actions, climate change is one of the factors forcing the family to make tough decisions about their future.",
      "Devastating frosts in recent years have caused \u201ccatastrophic\u201d crop loss. They\u2019ve also had to reconcile with changing consumer attitudes, as U.S. consumption of wine fell over the past few years, according to wine industry advocacy group Wine Institute.",
      "By this year\u2019s end, the vineyard will stop producing wine and instead will hold community workshops and sell certain grape varieties.",
      "\u201cThe farm and the vineyard, you know, it\u2019s part of me,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019ll let the people whose dream and life is to make wine do that part, and I\u2019ll happily support them.\u201d",
      "Vinny Aliperti, owner of Billsboro Winery along Seneca Lake, is working to improve the wine industry\u2019s environmental footprint. In the past year, he\u2019s helped establish communal wine bottle dumpsters that divert the glass from entering landfills and reuse it for construction materials.",
      "But Aliperti said he\u2019d like to see more nearby wineries and vineyards in sustainability efforts. The wine industry\u2019s longevity depends on it, especially under a presidential administration that doesn\u2019t seem to have sustainability at top of mind, he said.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all a bit scared, frankly, a bit, I mean, depressed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see very good things coming out of the next four years in terms of the environment.\u201d",
      "Osborn is bracing for sweeping cuts to federal environmental policies that previously made it easier to fund sustainability initiatives. Tax credits for Osborn\u2019s solar panels made up about half of over $400,000 in upfront costs, in addition to some state and federal grants. Osborn wants to increase his solar production, but he said he won\u2019t have enough money without those programs.",
      "Fox Run could also lose thousands of dollars from retaliatory tariffs and boycotts of American wine from his Canadian customers. In March, Canada introduced 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods \u2014 including wine.",
      "Osborn fears he can\u2019t compete with larger wine-growing states like California, which may flood the American market to make up for lost customers abroad. Smaller vineyards in the Finger Lakes might not survive these economic pressures, he said.",
      "Back at Fox Run's barrel room, Aric Bryant, a decade-long patron, says all the challenges make him even more supportive of New York wines.",
      "\u201cI have this, like, fierce loyalty,\u201d he said. \"I go to restaurants around here and if they don\u2019t have Finger Lakes wines on their menu, I\u2019m like, \u2018What are you even doing serving wine?\u2019\u201d",

A representative of Mahdawi and a Justice Department lawyer did not immediately respond to an emailed request for the document Wednesday morning.",
      "Mahdawi had attended his interview, answered questions and signed a document that he was willing to defend the U.S. Constitution and laws of the nation.",
      "\u201cIt was a trap,\u201d his lawyers said.",
      "They said masked ICE agents entered the interview room, shackled Mahdawi, and put him in a car. A judge later issued an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "Mahdawi is still scheduled for a hearing date in immigration court in Louisiana on May 1, his attorneys said. His notice to appear says he is removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act because the Secretary of State has determined his presence and activities \"would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\u201d",
      "Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges.",
      "According to the court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the United States in 2014. He recently completed coursework at Columbia and was expected to graduate in May before beginning a master\u2019s degree program there in the fall.",

      "Mati Carbon was among more than 1,300 teams from 88 countries that participated in the four-year XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition, launched in 2021 to encourage deployment of carbon-removal technologies. Many scientists believe removing carbon is crucial in the fight against global warming, caused by the burning of fossil fuels like gasoline, coal and oil, which release carbon dioxide.",
      "\u201cIt's important that we not promote carbon dioxide removal as a replacement for emissions reduction,\u201d said Michael Leitch, the technical lead for the competition. \u201cBut the race is really on both to dramatically reduce our existing emissions (and) also ... deploy carbon dioxide removal solutions at very, very large scales globally.\u201d",
      "The prize is being awarded at a time when Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency are making steep cuts to federal funding and staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Weather Service and other science-based agencies that carry out important climate research. The Trump administration has also moved to roll back myriad environmental regulations, including some that regulate carbon emissions.",
      "While the Musk Foundation sponsored XPRIZE Carbon Removal, which distributed a total of $100 million, it is not formally affiliated with the California-based organization, XPRIZE officials said.",
      "XPRIZE runs other contests to try to solve societal challenges. Executive director Nikki Batchelor said the organization is considering more climate-related competitions addressing such issues as removal of the potent greenhouse gas methane, reforestation and climate adaptation and resilience.",
      "Mati Carbon CEO Shantanu Agarwal believes his company's relatively low-cost approach \u201chas a potential to really solve some planetary scale problems\u201d while helping small farmers who often bear the brunt of climate change, as extreme weather events like drought and floods destroy crops.",
      "The method, called enhanced rock weathering, is fairly straightforward, said Jake Jordan, the company's chief science officer: When it rains, water and carbon dioxide mix in the atmosphere, forming carbonic acid, which falls on rock and eventually breaks it down into small bits of silica. The carbonic acid is converted to a mineral called bicarbonate, which cannot re-gas to the atmosphere and eventually is washed to the ocean, where it is stored for about 10,000 years.",
      "Mati Carbon spreads already-crushed basalt rock \u2014 plentiful in many parts of the world \u2014 on the fields \u201cto speed up something that happens anyway,\u201d Jordan said. The crushed rock also releases nutrients that help regenerate soils and increase productivity.",
      "Smaller prizes were awarded in the competition\u2019s final year to several other teams that also successfully removed 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide, a threshold that demonstrates an ability to scale up to remove gigatons in the coming decades.",
      "That included $15 million to runner-up NetZero, which turns crop residues such as coffee husks into biochar, charcoal-like particles that can be used on fields to help store carbon in soils while also improving nutrient and water retention.",
      "Other projects involved storing organic waste deep underground, enhancing oceans' ability to store carbon and removing carbon directly from the air.",
      "Scientists have been exploring the gamut of so-called geoengineering solutions to climate change, from drying the upper atmosphere to pumping minerals into the ocean to absorb carbon.",
      "Rick Spinrad, former administrator at NOAA, called the finalists' solutions \u201cscientifically extraordinary concepts\u201d and said the best approach to reducing carbon probably will be a combination of technologies.",
      "Leitch, from XPRIZE, said some solutions that did not win \u2014 including direct air and direct ocean capture of carbon dioxide \u2014 might have an advantage when deployed on a large scale.",

      "\u201cI just thought it was absurd,\u201d the Austin, Texas, immigration attorney said.",
      "It was an apparent glitch in the Trump administration's dismantling of another Biden-era policy that allowed people to live and work in the country temporarily. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is quietly revoking two-year permits of people who used an online appointment app at U.S. border crossings with Mexico called CBP One, which brought in more than 900,000 people starting in January 2023.",
      "The revocation of CBP One permits has lacked the fanfare and formality of canceling Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands whose homelands were previously deemed unsafe for return and humanitarian parole for others from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came with financial sponsors. Those moves came with official notices in the Federal Register and press releases. Judges halted them from taking effect after advocacy groups sued.",
      "CBP One cancellation notices began landing in inboxes in late March without warning, some telling recipients to leave immediately and others giving them seven days. Targets included U.S. citizens.",

      "CBP confirmed in a statement that it issued notices terminating temporary legal status under CBP One. It did not say how many, just that they weren't sent to all beneficiaries, which totaled 936,000 at the end of December.",
      "CBP said notices may have been sent to unintended recipients, including attorneys, if beneficiaries provided contact information for U.S. citizens. It is addressing those situations case-by-case.",
      "Online chat groups reflect fear and confusion, which, according to critics, is the administration's intended effect. Brenner said three clients who received the notices chose to return to El Salvador after being told to leave.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know how many people got this notice is part of the problem. We\u2019re getting reports from attorneys and folks who don\u2019t know what to make of the notice,\u201d said Hillary Li, counsel for the Justice Action Center, an advocacy group.",
      "President Donald Trump suspended CBP One for new arrivals his first day in office but those already in the U.S. believed they could stay at least until their two-year permits expired. The cancellation notices that some received ended that sense of temporary stability. \u201cIt is time for you to leave the United States,\u201d the letters began.",
      "\u201cIt's really confusing,\u201d said Robyn Barnard, senior director for refugee advocacy at Human Rights First. \u201cImagine how people who entered through that process feel when they're hearing through their different community chats, rumors or screenshots that some friends have received notice and others didn't.\u201d",
      "Attorneys say some CBP One beneficiaries may still be within a one-year window to file an asylum claim or seek other relief.",

      "A Texas man is facing execution for the strangling and stabbing death of a young North Texas mother more than 20 years ago",
      "HOUSTON -- A Texas man is facing execution Wednesday for the strangling and stabbing death of a young North Texas mother more than 20 years ago.",
      "Moises Sandoval Mendoza was condemned for the March 2004 killing of 20-year-old Rachelle O\u2019Neil Tolleson. Prosecutors say Mendoza took Tolleson from her home in Farmersville, leaving her 6-month-old daughter alone. The infant was found cold and wet but safe the next day by Tolleson\u2019s mother. Tolleson\u2019s body was found six days later near a creek.",
      "Mendoza, 41, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "Evidence in Mendoza\u2019s case showed he also burned Tolleson\u2019s body to hide his fingerprints. Dental records were used to identify her, according to investigators.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s lawyers have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the scheduled execution after lower courts previously rejected his petitions for a stay. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Mendoza\u2019s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "In their petition before the Supreme Court, Mendoza\u2019s attorneys said he was prevented by lower courts from arguing that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel earlier in the appeals process.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s lawyers allege that a previous appeals attorney, as well as his trial lawyer, had failed to challenge critical testimony by a detention officer, Robert Hinton. That testimony was used by prosecutors to persuade jurors that Mendoza would be a future danger to society \u2014 a legal finding needed to secure a death sentence in Texas.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s lawyers allege the officer, who worked in the county jail where the inmate was being held after his arrest, gave false testimony that Mendoza had started a fight with another inmate. Mendoza\u2019s lawyers say the other inmate now claims in an affidavit that he believed detention officers wanted him to start the fight, and he was later rewarded for it.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt the jury was listening. During its deliberations, the jury specifically asked about Mendoza\u2019s \u2018criminal acts while in jail,\u2019 including the \u2018assault on other inmate,\u2019\u201d Mendoza\u2019s lawyers said in their petition to the Supreme Court. \u201cAs evidenced by the jury\u2019s notes, there is a reasonable probability that trial counsel\u2019s error in failing to investigate Hinton\u2019s testimony affected the result.\u201d",
      "But the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office told the Supreme Court that Mendoza\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has already been found by a lower federal court to be \u201cmeritless and insubstantial.\u201d",
      "Even if the detention officer\u2019s testimony were eliminated, the jury heard substantial evidence regarding Mendoza\u2019s future dangerousness and his long history of violence, especially against women, including physically attacking his mother and sister and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cFinally, given the extreme delay in this two-decade-old case, the public interest weighs heavily against a stay. The State and crime victims have a \u2019powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty,\u2019\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said in its petition.",
      "Authorities said that in the days before the killing, Mendoza had attended a party at Tolleson\u2019s home in Farmersville, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) northeast of Dallas. On the day her body was found, Mendoza told a friend about the killing. The friend called police and Mendoza was arrested.",
      "Mendoza confessed to police but couldn\u2019t give detectives a reason for his actions, authorities said. He told investigators he repeatedly choked Tolleson, sexually assaulted her and dragged her body to a field, where he choked her again and then stabbed her in the throat. He later moved her body to a more remote location and burned it.",
      "If the execution is carried out, Mendoza would be the third inmate put to death this year in Texas, historically the nation\u2019s busiest capital punishment state, and the 13th in the U.S.",
      "On Thursday, Alabama planned to execute James Osgood for the 2010 rape and murder of a woman.",

      "Survivors and relatives of people killed in a 2022 mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in suburban Chicago are set to speak at the sentencing of the gunman",
      "WAUKEGAN, Ill. -- Survivors and relatives of people killed in a 2022 mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in suburban Chicago were set to speak Wednesday at the sentencing hearing for the gunman, who chose not to attend.",
      "Robert E. Crimo III, 24, pleaded guilty last month to the shooting that left seven people dead and dozens more injured. He changed his plea moments before opening statements at his trial after years of unpredictable legal proceedings.",
      "Crimo is not attending the hearings or watching from jail, said Lake County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Christopher Covelli. He has previously skipped court, including during parts of jury selection, despite warnings from Judge Victoria Rossetti that things would move forward in his absence.",
      "Testimony from survivors was expected to be emotional and boxes of tissues were spread throughout the packed courtroom, including on the witness stand and near the public seating.",
      "Spectators in court, including many survivors, wiped tears while others put their arms around each other as footage of the parade was shown. One person clutched a blue nubbed stress ball.",
      "Crimo\u2019s parents, who have attended most court proceedings, were not present Wednesday.",
      "Crimo is certain to spend the rest of his life in prison. Each count of first-degree murder carries a maximum natural life sentence in Illinois. Prosecutors and attorneys for survivors said before the hearing that addressing Crimo is an important step.",
      "\u201cThey have been patiently waiting for justice to be served,\u201d said a statement from Romanucci & Blandin, a Chicago-based law firm that represents nearly 50 victims. They \u201cwill tell their personal stories to the court, and they are steadfastly committed to pursuing justice.\u201d",
      "Security was tight Wednesday with observers required to lock up their phones and pass through two sets of metal detectors.",
      "Attorneys were unsure how many people might give so-called victim impact statements, saying some may decide at the last minute. Prosecutors began the sentencing hearing by laying out evidence against Crimo. The hearing is at the Lake County Courthouse, roughly 45 miles (70 kilometers) from Chicago.",
      "Prosecutors played video clips showing a band marching as multiple shots rang out and the crowd, including young children, started fleeing the parade route in a panic. Band members carrying instruments ran down the street as emergency sirens blared.",
      "Retired Highland Park Police Commander Gerry Cameron, who was on duty the day of the parade, testified that when he first heard the gunshots he thought it might have been fireworks or a car backfiring. When he ran toward the sound, he saw injured people.",
      "\u201cAs I was moving eastbound, people were running to the west frantically panicked,\u201d Cameron testified.",
      "Authorities said Crimo perched on a roof and fired into the crowds. Witnesses described confusion as the shots began, followed by terror as families bolted from the downtown parade route, leaving lawn chairs and strollers behind.",
      "Conway described clearing people, including children, who were sheltering in businesses near the parade route.",
      "\u201cThey were reluctant to come out. They were reluctant to come to the door,\u201d he said, pausing before adding: \u201cThey were horrified.\u201d",
      "Dozens were wounded in the shooting in the suburb about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Chicago. They ranged in age from their 80s to an 8-year-old boy who was left partially paralyzed.",
      "Prosecutors had reams of evidence, including Crimo\u2019s videotaped confession to police.",
      "Prosecutors initially charged Crimo with 21 counts of first-degree murder \u2014 three counts for each person killed \u2014 and 48 counts of attempted murder for the injured. Prosecutors later dropped 48 less serious counts of aggravated battery before jury selection.",
      "The case has moved slowly through the court, in part because of Crimo\u2019s erratic behavior.",
      "He was expected to accept a plea deal last year but changed his mind once he got to court, shocking even his own attorneys.",
      "Crimo fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself. Then he reversed his decision. After he pleaded guilty in court, he signed documents waiving his right to trial with both his own name and the name \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d",
      "Residents in the upscale Highland Park community of roughly 30,000 have mourned the shooting deeply. Some potential jurors were excused because of their connections to the case. Several survivors have also filed lawsuits against Crimo and gunmaker Smith & Wesson.",
      "City leaders canceled the usual parade in 2023, opting instead for a \u201ccommunity walk.\u201d The parade was reinstated last year on a different route and included a memorial.",
      "The seven people killed in the shooting were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Crimo\u2019s father, Robert Crimo Jr., a former mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct. He served less than two months in jail.",

      "Some international students in the U.S. who have had their legal status terminated in recent weeks have found a measure of success in court, with federal judges around the country issuing orders to restore students\u2019 status at least temporarily",
      "ATLANTA -- Anjan Roy was studying with friends at Missouri State University when he got an email that turned his world upside down. His legal status as an international student had been terminated, and he was suddenly at risk for deportation.",
      "\u201cI was in literal shock, like, what the hell is this?\u201d said Roy, a graduate student in computer science from Bangladesh.",
      "At first, he avoided going out in public, skipping classes and mostly keeping his phone turned off. A court ruling in his favor led to his status being restored this week, and he has returned to his apartment, but he is still asking his roommates to screen visitors.",
      "More than a thousand international students have faced similar disruptions in recent weeks, with their academic careers \u2014 and their lives in the U.S. \u2014 thrown into doubt in a widespread crackdown by the Trump administration. Some have found a measure of success in court, with federal judges around the country issuing orders to restore students' legal status at least temporarily.",
      "In addition to the case filed in Atlanta, where Roy is among 133 plaintiffs, judges have issued temporary restraining orders in states including New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Judges have denied similar requests in some other cases, saying it was not clear the loss of status would cause irreparable harm.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges. But many affected students said they have been involved only in minor infractions, or it's unclear altogether why they were targeted.",
      "The attorney for Roy and his fellow plaintiffs, Charles Kuck, argued the government did not have legal grounds to terminate the students\u2019 status.",
      "He speculated in court last week the government is trying to encourage these students to self-deport, saying \u201cthe pressure on these students is overwhelming.\u201d He said some asked him if it was safe to leave their homes to get food, and others worried they wouldn't receive a degree after years of work or feared their chances of a career in the U.S. were shot.",
      "\u201cI think the hope is they\u2019ll just leave,\u201d Kuck said. \u201cThe reality is these kids are invested.\u201d",
      "An attorney for the government, R. David Powell, argued the students did not suffer significant harm because they could transfer their academic credits or find jobs in another country.",
      "At least 1,100 students at 174 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP is working to confirm reports of hundreds more students who are caught up in the crackdown.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Monday by four people on student visas at the University of Iowa, attorneys detail the \u201cmental and financial suffering\u201d they\u2019ve experienced. One graduate student, from India, \"cannot sleep and is having difficulty breathing and eating,\u201d the lawsuit reads. He has stopped going to school, doing research or working as a teaching assistant. Another student, a Chinese undergraduate who expected to graduate this December, said his revoked status has caused his depression to worsen to the point that his doctor increased his medication dosage. The student, the lawsuit says, has not left his apartment out of fear of detention.",
      "Roy, 23, began his academic career at Missouri State in August 2024 as an undergraduate computer science student. He was active in the chess club and a fraternity and has a broad circle of friends. After graduating in December, he began work on a master\u2019s degree in January and expects to finish in May 2026.",
      "When Roy received the university's April 10 email on his status termination, one of his friends offered to skip class to go with him to the school\u2019s international services office, even though they had a quiz in 45 minutes. The staff there said a database check showed his student status had been terminated, but they didn\u2019t know why.",
      "Roy said his only brush with the law came in 2021, when he was questioned by campus security after someone called in a dispute at a university housing building. But he said an officer determined there was no evidence of any crime and no charges were filed.",
      "Roy also got an email from the U.S. embassy in Bangladesh telling him his visa had been revoked and that he could be detained at any time. It warned that if he was deported, he could be sent to a country other than his own. Roy thought about leaving the U.S. but decided to stay after talking to a lawyer.",
      "Anxious about being in his own apartment, Roy went to stay with his second cousin and her husband nearby.",
      "\u201cThey were scared someone was going to pick me up from the street and take me somewhere that they wouldn\u2019t even know,\u201d Roy said.",
      "He mostly stayed inside, turned off his phone unless he needed to use it, and avoided internet browsers that track user data through cookies. His professors were understanding when he told them he wouldn\u2019t be able to come to classes for a while, he said.",
      "After the judge\u2019s order Friday, he moved back to his apartment. He learned Tuesday his status had been restored, and he plans to return to class. But he\u2019s still nervous. He asked his two roommates, both international students, to let him know before they open the door if someone they don\u2019t know knocks.",
      "The judge\u2019s restoration of his legal status is temporary. Another hearing scheduled for Thursday will determine whether he keeps that status while the litigation continues.",
      "Roy chose the U.S. over other options in Canada and Australia because of the research opportunities and potential for professional connections, and he ultimately wanted to teach at an American university. But now those plans are up in the air.",
      "His parents, back in Dhaka, have been watching the news and are \u201cfreaked out,\u201d he said. His father mentioned to him that they have family in Melbourne, Australia, including a cousin who\u2019s an assistant professor at a university there. ___",

      "NEW YORK -- The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for an error in a 2017 editorial that she says damaged her reputation, a jury concluded Tuesday.",
      "The jury deliberated a little over two hours before reaching its verdict after lawyers for Palin and the newspaper delivered closing arguments at a Manhattan federal court civil trial that was in its second week.",
      "Palin was sullen immediately after the verdict was announced by a jury foreperson who said the Times was \u201cnot libel.\u201d",
      "She testified Monday that death threats against her increased and her spirits fell after an editorial about gun violence said her political action committee had contributed to political rhetoric that enabled an atmosphere of violence.",
      "The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published.",
      "Palin was subdued as she left the courthouse for the final time and made her way to a waiting car, telling reporters: \u201cI get to go home to a beautiful family of five kids and grandkids and a beautiful property and get on with life. And that\u2019s nice.\u201d",
      "Later, she posted on the social platform X that she \u201cdidn't prevail\u201d in her lawsuit but vowed to \u201ckeep asking the press to quit making things up.\u201d",
      "Kenneth Turkel, an attorney for Palin, said as he left the courthouse that the legal team will evaluate all posttrial and appellate options.",
      "Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokesperson, said in a statement that the verdict \u201creaffirms an important tenet of American law: publishers are not liable for honest mistakes.\u201d",
      "In his closing argument, Turkel had urged the jury to find the Times liable for defamation on the grounds that its former editorial page editor, James Bennet, either knew what he was publishing was wrong or acted with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth.",
      "He asked the jury to award Palin compensatory damages for the harm done to her reputation and private mental anguish, adding that they should \u201cfind a number and let her get some closure to this thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo this day, there been no accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why we're here.\u201d",
      "He told jurors not to be deceived by Palin's \u201cbouncy\u201d persona on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cShe doesn't cry a lot,\u201d Turkel said. \u201cIt may have been to them an honest mistake. For her, it was a life changer.\u201d",
      "Palin, who earned a journalism degree in college, sued the Times for unspecified damages in 2017, about a decade after she burst onto the national stage as the Republican vice-presidential nominee.",
      "Her lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded in 2017 when a man with a history of anti-GOP activity opened fire on a Congressional baseball team practice in Washington.",
      "In the editorial, the Times wrote that before the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others, Palin\u2019s political action committee had contributed to an atmosphere of violence by circulating a map of electoral districts that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.",
      "In a correction, The Times said the editorial had \u201cincorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting\u201d and that it had \u201cincorrectly described\u201d the map.",
      "A tearful Bennet apologized to Palin from the witness stand when he testified last week, saying he was tormented by the error and worked urgently to correct it after readers complained to the newspaper.",
      "Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney for the Times, told jurors in her closing that there was not \"one shred of evidence showing anything other than an honest mistake.\u201d",
      "Ellsworth said Bennet and the Times \u201ccorrected the record loudly, clearly and quickly\u201d once the error was discovered.",
      "The lawyer pointed out that several Times editors testified consistently about the effort to correct the error and the importance they placed on accuracy while Palin's claims were \u201csupported by nothing other than her say so.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo Gov. Palin, this is just another opportunity to take on fake news. To James Bennet, the truth matters,\u201d Ellsworth said.",
      "In February 2022, Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected Palin\u2019s claims in a ruling issued while a jury deliberated. The judge then let jurors deliver their verdict, which also went against Palin.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan restored the case last year.",
      "The appeals court said Rakoff\u2019s dismissal ruling improperly intruded on the jury\u2019s work. It also cited flaws in the trial, saying there was erroneous exclusion of evidence, an inaccurate jury instruction and a mistaken response to a question from the jury.",

      "The executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission has resigned in the latest shake-up at the state\u2019s retail gambling enterprise amid multiple investigations into large jackpots in 2023 and earlier this year and threats from some lawmakers to shut ...",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission has resigned, the latest shake-up at the state's retail gambling enterprise amid multiple investigations into jackpots in 2023 and earlier this year totaling nearly $200 million, and calls from some lawmakers to shut it down.",
      "The lottery announced Ryan Mindell's resignation on Monday without comment. A former deputy director and operations director at the lottery, Mindell had held the top job for only about a year following the abrupt resignation of his predecessor.",
      "He leaves as the agency faces at least two investigations ordered by Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton into the integrity of the lottery prizes, and how the state handled the introduction of courier companies that buy and send tickets on behalf of customers online.",
      "The companies and lottery officials have denied wrongdoing. But Texas state lawmakers are considering forcing several changes, ranging from a legal ban on sales through courier companies to shutting down the agency by taking away all of its funding.",
      "The Texas lottery was established in 1991 and sends a portion of its annual revenue to public education. In 2024, that meant about $2 billion sent to the state's public school fund.",
      "But two of the biggest jackpots in agency history prompted flares of scrutiny and criticism from media, lawmakers and state officials who question whether they were fairly won and if courier companies should be allowed.",
      "First, a $95 million jackpot in 2023 was awarded when the winners bought nearly every possible number combination \u2014 more than 25 million of them. In February, an $83 million ticket was won with a ticket purchased at a courier store. The chain that operates the store has locations in six states.",
      "A Houston Chronicle investigation initially detailed the buying efforts behind the 2023 jackpot, but it was the second one that finally grabbed the attention of prominent state lawmakers, as well as the governor and the state attorney general. An agency that typically garners little attention beyond the millions it awards in jackpots and scratch-off ticket games was suddenly under fire.",
      "Abbott ordered the state's elite Texas Rangers law enforcement agency to open an investigation, and Paxton announced a probe by the state attorney general's office. Those remain ongoing.",
      "A Texas lottery spokesman declined further comment on Mindell\u2019s resignation. Abbott\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "The Legislature, meanwhile, has held public hearings to scold lottery officials for allowing the use of courier companies to bypass state law that requires tickets to be purchased in person. Mindell had told state lawmakers in February that the agency had previously determined it did not have the authority to regulate courier companies, but said the agency would now move to ban them.",
      "State lawmakers are approaching the final month of their biennial session and have threatened action ranging from writing a courier ban into state law, or even more drastic measures such as shutting down the lottery altogether.",
      "The state Senate has already passed a ban on courier sales, but the measure has yet to get a vote in the House. The House and Senate will soon negotiate a final version of the two-year state budget. The House version currently includes no money for the agency, which would effectively close it down.",
      "But that effort is likely more of a message that lawmakers are serious about making changes than seriously thinking of closing down an agency that generates billions in sales and for public schools annually.",
      "State law allows Texas jackpots to be claimed anonymously, and the April 2023 jackpot was collected two months later in the form of a one-time payment of $57.8 million to a company called Rook TX.",
      "The payment for the February jackpot, however, is on hold pending the state investigations. An attorney for a woman who claims to hold the winning ticket has said it was legally purchased among a group of 10 she bought through the courier Jacketpocket.",

      "MILFORD, Conn. -- A Connecticut jury on Tuesday convicted a man of murder and evidence tampering in the 2019 killing of his girlfriend, while the disappearance of their young daughter remains a mystery.",
      "Jose Morales, 48, of New Haven, faces 25 to 65 years in prison when he is sentenced on July 8 for the beating death of Christine Holloway inside her home in Ansonia, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of New Haven.",
      "Morales testified at the trial in Milford that he did not kill Holloway. He said he, Holloway and their daughter, Vanessa, who was 14 months old at the time, were in Holloway's apartment when two intruders broke in. He said one of the intruders attacked Holloway with a crowbar and he was assaulted before they kidnapped Vanessa, who has never been found. Morales also said he was high on PCP at the time.",
      "Days after the killing, authorities issued an Amber Alert for Vanessa, whose missing person case remains posted on the websites of the FBI and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Ansonia police said in late 2019 that Morales was a suspect in Vanessa's disappearance, but he was never charged.",
      "During closing arguments on Monday, Supervisory Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Howard Stein said the evidence showed that Morales repeatedly struck Holloway in the head with an object and tried to cover it up by cleaning up the crime scene.",
      "Morales' lawyer, Edward Gavin, declined to comment after the verdict. During his closing argument, he said there was no evidence that Morales had any intent to kill Holloway.",
      "The jury began deliberating Monday afternoon and reached a verdict Tuesday morning after about two total hours of discussion.",

      "NEW YORK -- George Santos is defending his recent social media tirade to a federal judge who will be sentencing the disgraced former New York congressman later this week on fraud charges.",
      "In a lengthy letter ahead of the Friday court date, Santos, 36, said he remains \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d for his crimes but protests that the seven-year prison sentence sought by prosecutors as \u201cridiculous\u201d and overly harsh.",
      "\u201cEvery sunrise since that plea has carried the same realization: I did this, me. I am responsible,\u201d wrote the former Republican lawmaker, who pleaded guilty last summer. \u201cBut saying I\u2019m sorry doesn\u2019t require me to sit quietly while these prosecutors try to drop an anvil on my head.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, in a filing last week, argued Santos \u201cremains unrepentant\u201d and has not shown genuine remorse, as his lawyers have claimed in their own filing seeking a lighter, two-year prison stint.",
      "They cited a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, in which he disparaged the U.S. Department of Justice as a \u201ccabal of pedophiles\u201d and cast himself as a victim of prosecutorial overreach.",
      "Santos, who admitted he deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people to fund his congressional campaign, countered that his \u201ccolorful\u201d posts are being wrongly \u201crepurposed as a sword against me\u201d by prosecutors.",
      "\u201cContesting the severity of a proposed sentence is not the same as contesting guilt, and punishing protected speech because it questions punishment should trouble anyone who values fair prosecution over personal vindication,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Santos said calling himself the \u201cscapegoat\u201d in social media posts was in reference to prosecutors claiming he was the \u201corganizer/leader\u201d of his campaign\u2019s financial fraud and warranted a stiffer sentence. He argued his former campaign treasurer, Nancy Marks, who has also pleaded guilty and faces sentencing next month, shares equal part in the blame.",
      "\u201cIf I were the criminal mastermind they portray, I would be the clumsiest in modern memory: leaving a trail of screenshots pointing directly back to myself,\u201d he wrote in the Saturday letter.",
      "Santos also pushed back at prosecutors\u2019 claims that he has not made efforts to pay the roughly $580,000 owed as part of his plea deal, saying he\u2019s \u201cliquidated personal assets, reduced my living expenses, and tried as hard as I could to raise some money for restitution.\u201d",
      "He added that he has not asked any of his friends or family to write letters to the court on his behalf, nor did he expect any supporters to attend Friday\u2019s sentencing in Long Island federal court out of embarrassment and shame.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring anyone else in my life into this mess,\u201d Santos wrote. \u201cThis is mine to deal with and mine alone.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York\u2019s office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.",
      "Santos was elected in 2022 to represent parts of Queens and Long Island but served barely a year before being ousted by his House colleagues.",
      "Santos fabricated much of his life story, leading to questions about how the political unknown had funded his winning campaign.",

      "The U.S. Justice Department has not said why he's being detained. The New York Times reported April 15 that Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote a memo that says Mahdawi's activities could \u201cpotentially undermine\u201d the Middle East peace process. A message seeking comment on the memo was emailed to the State Department on Tuesday.",
      "Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify the deportation of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. It gives Rubio power to deport those who pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "An immigration judge ruled April 11 that Khalil can be forced out of the country as a national security risk, after lawyers argued the legality of deporting the activist who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. His lawyers plan to appeal.",
      "Mahdawi said that in studying for his citizenship test, he learned \"that the freedom of speech and religion and assembly is guaranteed to everyone in the United States, which is part of the foundation of this country.\u201d",
      "Mahdawi said his work \u201chas been centered on peacemaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy empathy, as I mentioned before, extends beyond the Palestinian people and my empathy extends to the Jews and to the Israelis,\" he said. \"And my hope and my dream is to see this conflict, if one might say, to see an end to the war, an end to the killing, to see a peaceful resolution between Palestinians and Israelis. How could this be a threat to anybody, except the war machine that is feeding this?\u201d",
      "Welch responded, \u201cIt would be good for everybody for us to have peace.\u201d",
      "Madawi said, \u201cI want to tell everyone that I feel so loved and so supported. And I am here in good hands. I am centered, I am clear, I am grounded. And I don\u2019t want you to worry about me.\"",
      "According to the court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the United States in 2014. He recently completed coursework at Columbia and was expected to graduate in May before beginning a master\u2019s degree program there in the fall.",
      "As a student, Mahdawi was an outspoken critic of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza and organized campus protests until March 2024.",

      "The UK is seeking to lower trade taxes imposed by President Donald Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports.",
      "One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.",
      "Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.",
      "The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.",
      "President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US \u2013 including from the UK.",
      "The UK is also facing a broader tariff rate of 10%, and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",

      "\"We are willing to reduce trade barriers in the UK, those trade barriers that do exist. And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",
      "Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".",
      "But she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".",
      "\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.",
      "Reeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".",
      "\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.",

      "Heidi Alexander said the government would aim to clear the backlog by next summer, providing at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month to help tackle the issue.",
      "Current driving test wait times are \"totally unacceptable\", she told parliament's transport committee on Wednesday.",
      "There is a minimum six-month wait to book a driving test in several areas of the UK, according to data from the AA.",
      "The transport secretary said the new measures would help reduce average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026.",
      "It means the government is set to miss its original target for waiting times by up eight months.",
      "The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) had planned on cutting waiting times to seven weeks by the end of this year. It has blamed an \"increase in demand and a change in customers' booking behaviour\" for the backlog.",
      "In order to tackle the delays, Alexander revealed plans to double training capacity so more driving examiners would be available.",
      "She said she was also asking those in other DVSA roles who are qualified, but not longer examine, to temporarily \"return to the frontline\".",
      "She said it would also reintroduce overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests.",
      "A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, but the government would now consult on changes to the test booking system, Alexander added.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 23:04:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",
    "story": [
      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

      "\"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said.",
      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".",
      "\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.",

      "\"I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,\" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.",

    "story": [
      "The US dollar has seen big declines in recent months.",
      "Currencies rise and fall all the time but the recent drop in the dollar has been particularly dramatic.",
      "So why has the dollar been falling and why does it matter?",
      "What has happened to the dollar since Trump was elected?",
      "The dollar was rising in the autumn in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election off the back of relatively strong US economic growth, and continued to strengthen after Trump's victory in November on hopes he might extend that trend.",
      "Talk of his trade policy also had an effect, as many investors thought the tariffs that he promised to bring in would push up inflation, forcing the US central bank, the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or at least not cut them as fast as expected.",
      "The prospect of higher rates in the US makes the dollar more attractive as it means investors will make more money on their cash in dollars compared to other currencies.",
      "But the calculus has shifted in recent months as the details of his tariffs have emerged - often followed by pauses or, in the case of China, extensions - leaving much uncertainty surrounding the impact they will have.",
      "US growth is now widely expected to weaken.",
      "That has had a knock-on impact on the dollar, which has seen steep falls. Trump's attacks on Fed chief Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates also appear to have added pressure to the greenback.",
      "The value of all currencies goes up and down influenced by many factors such as inflation expectations and central bank policies.",
      "But the dollar index, which measures its strength against a set of currencies, has fallen to its lowest level for three years.",
      "US stocks and dollar plunge as Trump attacks Fed chair Powell",
      "Is this unusual?",
      "The dollar is usually seen as a safe investment in troubled times.",
      "So the sharp drops in the currency - as well as the recent sell-off in US government bonds, also generally considered a safe US asset - are unusual.",
      "The fall in the dollar after Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement was \"quite shocking\", says Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange (FX) strategy at Rabobank.",
      "\"For several years, the market's been buying this US growth story, the US stock market's been outperforming other stock markets, and suddenly you had economists thinking tariffs would push the US into recession,\" she says, pointing to the massive sell-off of US stocks, US bonds and the dollar.",
      "That has raised speculation about whether the drop might signal a more far-reaching turn away from the US, as well as away from the dollar.",
      "What does a weaker dollar mean?",
      "The first time ordinary Americans might notice a weaker dollar is when they go abroad, as their money will not go as far. While foreign tourists in the US will find their currency will buy them more.",
      "But movements in the dollar also have a massive impact internationally, more so than swings in other currencies do.",
      "That's because it is the world's primary reserve currency, meaning it is held by central banks around the world in large quantities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Central banks use US dollars in international transactions, to pay for international debt, or to support domestic exchange rates.",
      "The dollar is also the main currency used in international trade, with around half of world trade invoices done in US dollars, says Jane Foley.",
      "A fall in the dollar means US goods exports become cheaper. But imported goods may become more expensive due to the weaker currency, as well as any direct impact from tariffs.",
      "Many commodities that trade internationally, such as oil and gas, are also priced in dollars. A weaker dollar makes crude oil cheaper for countries that hold other currencies.",
      "What happens if the dollar keeps falling?",
      "In the US a strong dollar has been seen as a symbol of American political might.",
      "The very idea that it might lose its status as the world's reserve currency has been unthinkable.",
      "Ms Foley says that while other currencies may become more important, the dollar won't lose its number one status any time soon, although one Federal Reserve official suggested last year that the US can no longer take this for granted.",
      "Ms Foley thinks the dollar will win back some ground over the next few weeks but will not get back to where it was.",
      "That's because with very significant market moves, there's always the possibility of profit taking. For instance, if investors decide to sell euros while they're trading strongly, that could lead to the euro falling and the dollar rising.",
      "The markets will be watching this week to see if Trump continues his attack on the head of the Federal Reserve. He has called Mr Powell \"a major loser\" and has publicly called for his \"termination\".",
      "If there is pressure on Powell to leave office, the markets will start to wonder about the Fed's credibility, something which is seen as crucial.",
      "\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown."

      "The predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.",

      "Uncertainty around trade policy was a \"major factor\" behind the growth downgrades, Mr Gourinchas said.",
      "\"Faced with increased uncertainty... many firms' initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment and cut purchases.\"",
      "The IMF predicts the global economy will grow by 2.8% this year, down from its previous forecast of 3.3%, and by 3.0% in 2026.",
      "The downgrade to the US growth forecast was due to greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions and slower than expected consumer spending, the IMF said. Tariffs are also expected to hit growth in 2026.",
      "The IMF said there was now a 40% probability of a US recession this year, higher than its estimate of 25% in October last year.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, banking group the Institute of International Finance said it expected \"a shallow recession\" in the US later this year, with negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.",
      "China is expected to grow by 4% this year, down from the IMF's previous estimate of 4.6%.",
      "In the UK, the downward revision reflects the impact of tariffs, higher government borrowing costs, and weaker consumer spending as a result of higher bills and energy costs.",
      "However, the IMF's 2025 prediction for the UK is now close to the 1% growth forecast by the government's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) last month. The IMF expects the UK to grow by 1.4% next year.",
      "Responding to the forecast, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK was still the fastest growing European G7 country due to \"reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK\".",
      "Reeves added that \"the world has changed\" and she would be in Washington this week \"defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade\".",

      "Mr Gourinchas said that while the reference forecast was the IMF's central scenario, \"many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries\".",
      "The IMF also looked at the situation after the US temporarily suspended many tariffs while raising those on China sharply.",

      "Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.",
      "So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.",
      "But recently that hasn't happened.",
      "Initially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.",
      "However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.",
      "The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.",
      "Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.",
      "The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.",
      "Why does Trump care?",
      "Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.",
      "Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.",
      "It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.",
      "Is this similar to Liz Truss's mini-Budget?",
      "The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.",
      "While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.",
      "\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.",
      "How is China being linked to US bonds?",
      "Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.",
      "Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.",
      "Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.",
      "However, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "From mid-October, Chinese ship-owners and operators will be charged $50 per ton of cargo with the fees increasing each year for the next three years.",
      "There have been concerns that the measures would further disrupt global trade after US President Donald Trump's raft of tariff policies, but the fee is less severe than originally suggested.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the fees will raise prices for American consumers and \"will not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry\".",
      "The US Trade Representative (USTR) said: \"China has largely achieved its dominance goals, severely disadvantaging US companies, workers, and the US economy\".",
      "Fees on Chinese vessel owners and operators of ships built in China will be based on the weight of their cargo, how many containers they carry or the number of vehicles onboard.",

      "The $50 per ton of cargo will rise by $30 a ton each year for the next three years. Fees on Chinese-built ships will start at $18 a ton or $120 per container and also rise over the next three years.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:31:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",
      "Stamp duty changes 'will motivate first-time buyers'",
      "'Buying a first home is harder when you're single'",
      "When will interest rates go down again?"

      "Why does the government borrow money?",
      "The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers pay income tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits.",
      "It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens.",
      "But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing.",
      "Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.",

      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "The government sells short and long-term gilts to allow it to borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates.",
      "How much is the UK government borrowing?",
      "The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month.",
      "For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go.",
      "So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date.",

      "That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.",

      "The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month.",
      "It was \u00a34.3bn in March 2025. This was \u00a31.3bn more than in March 2024, and is the highest March figure since monthly records began in 1997, though only \u00a30.2bn above the previous record set in March 2023.",

    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",

      "Ms Wareham said that of the 160 pupils at her primary, about 30 had registered to use the new breakfast club, compared to five or six who used the school's own one.",
      "\"There was a demand for an earlier provision - we have some families that work in London, so they can get on the train and get into town,\" Ms Wareham said.",
      "\"I think it is indicative of society at the moment.",
      "\"Sadly, I think more and more families have two parents that are working, so it's a change and a shift in society and the way the families are set up, and it's come to schools to support families with that.",

      "The decision to pull student support from Oxford Business College courses means that new students will not be able to apply for student loans to study there, and follows allegations that millions of pounds in student loans are being claimed by people who have no plans to study.",
      "Last month, the Sunday Times said it found evidence of some individuals enrolling on degree courses at small colleges just to access loans, with no intention of paying them back.",
      "The newspaper said most of the students under scrutiny are believed to be at franchised universities.",

      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "One family, three very different children. So how do they manage exam stress? And does having a teacher as a parent help?",
      "1. Open up the conversation",
      "\"I was very overwhelmed and I didn't want to do it,\" says Emma, thinking back to her A-level revision last year.",
      "She recently got diagnosed with ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - which has helped her understand why she found her A-level revision period so difficult.",
      "Emma says she sometimes finds it hard to focus until a deadline is drawing closer.",
      "\"I need the pressure - but I also hate it because I get so stressed and so burnt out so easily,\" she says.",
      "Emma also says she sometimes struggled to get started with revision - even though she wanted to do it - because of how her ADHD affects her ability to start tasks, and organise revision sessions into manageable chunks.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of shame and guilt, because I thought I was being lazy,\" she says. \"You feel really rubbish about yourself. Then when I get really overwhelmed I get headaches.\"",
      "Emma says her dad helped her to draw up a study plan, and to keep her on track when she didn't want to revise.",
      "\"I have very strong memories of Emma sitting at this kitchen table crying her eyes out, getting really, really stressed about revision,\" says dad Steve.",
      "\"And us kind of saying: 'OK that's fine, you need to take a break. But tomorrow you need to go again'.\"",
      "Developing resilience, digging deep and trying again after a bad day are things Steve says Emma did brilliantly while finding A-level revision overwhelming.",
      "\"As a parent, you don't want your kids to go through things that upset them,\" he adds. \"But actually where this is concerned, you kind of have to keep going.\"",
      "So what can parents and carers do?",
      "Talking about your feelings can be tough, but parenting expert Stevie Goulding, from the charity Young Minds, suggests keeping the lines of communication open all the way through the exam period, and making sure you're ready to listen when they're ready to talk.",
      "\"Anxiety gets magnified when young people are under further strain and stress,\" she says.",
      "\"Really recognise and reflect: 'I've noticed you've not been sleeping or eating as much', speaking observations into existence, and making sure there's a lot of reassurance.\"",
      "Listen here to 5 Minute On how to deal with revision stress on BBC Sounds",
      "2. Be creative",
      "There's no escaping it, revision can be really boring.",
      "\"I absolutely hate just sitting down with a laptop or book and just working,\" says Ben. \"But I think it's the best way for information to get into me.\"",
      "His GCSE results comprised mostly of the top grades of 7s, 8s and 9s. He loves maths and physics - something his sisters find hard to understand.",
      "He's sitting A-levels this summer, before taking a year out to decide between an apprenticeship or university.",
      "He and older sister Emma both say that doing past papers and applying their revision to the questions has really helped with their study in the past.",
      "\"If I'm not doing questions to apply it, it just doesn't go in,\" Ben says.",
      "But what works for one student may not work for others, and expert Stevie suggests that thinking creatively about how your child can revise is a good idea - think flashcards, mind maps or even YouTube videos.",
      "\"I love flash cards - they're so easy and quick,\" says youngest daughter Jess.",
      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",
      "3. Stay connected to what you love",
      "When we're stressed, it can be tempting to push aside time for fun and relaxation - but it's actually really important in helping us to perform well in exams, Stevie says.",
      "\"We really need to look after our brains. It's really important to get the balance.\"",
      "For Emma, reading or walks with her mum, dad and their dog Maisie was important time to carve out during A-levels.",
      "It's basketball for Jess, who is worried that her current knee injury means she won't be able to play to relax during her GCSE exams.",
      "\"Now I just come home and nap,\" she says.",
      "She says she's feeling the pressure with her GCSE grades, as not only does she need them for basketball college here, but her dreams of basketball college in the US for university afterwards rely on them too.",
      "Their brother Ben enjoys playing on his Xbox with friends, but says he drags himself back downstairs to do work when he realises he has been ignoring his revision a little too long.",
      "As a lot of exams rely on memory, expert Stevie says that staying hydrated, eating healthily, exercising, and having time to do the things we love can help us look after our brains.",
      "Time with your favourite TV show or even a scroll through TikTok can also help to find that balance.",
      "4. Avoid distractions",
      "You can't have too much of a good thing.",
      "Phones can help us to stay connected to friends and family during tough times, but they can also be distracting.",
      "\"I have to hide my phone underneath books or behind my laptop,\" says Emma. \"If I see it, I'll just go on it.\"",
      "When asked how she will avoid the distraction of her phone during her GCSE exams, younger sister Jess says she \"hasn't worked that one out yet\".",
      "Dad Steve has offered to take it away - if Jess wants him to - in order to help her focus.",
      "\"I don't think anyone is going to learn if they're being forced to sit in a room with someone standing over them, or with the threat of: 'We're going to take your phone away,'\" he says.",

      "But that can invalidate their feelings, says expert Stevie.",
      "\"We're all guilty of saying it and it comes often from a very good place,\" she says.",
      "\"But for that young person there is a very valid worry there.\"",
      "Instead, she suggests acknowledging the worry, and saying something like: \"I can absolutely hear that you are worried, and it's completely natural in exams, but you've put so much time and energy into revision.",
      "\"You've worked so hard and whatever happens, we'll be here to support you.\"",
      "What about when it all goes wrong?",
      "\"I think when things are getting tough, just step away from it,\" says teacher and dad Steve.",
      "\"Staying healthy - mentally healthy and physically healthy - has to be the most important thing.\"",
      "When tensions are high at home around revision and exams, arguments may happen. Stevie from Young Minds says that walking away and having a cooling off period is essential.",
      "\"Once people have cooled down, you can reflect, say that you understand why they are feeling so frustrated, and ask if there's anything you can do to support them.\"",
      "And when it's all over?",
      "\"I think something we'd definitely say as teachers is that it's not a good idea to come out of an exam and stand in a big group of people and hear what everyone else wrote,\" says Steve.",
      "And his daughter Emma agrees.",
      "\"I just walked out by myself, got my bag and went home,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not ruining this, goodbye!'\"",
      "\"It's just a great feeling of relief after you've done the exam,\" adds Ben.",
      "With exams around the corner, the Jolleys are also keeping an eye on what they have to look forward to after it's all finished.",

      "Their work looks at themes including \"the constructed self through the lens of rudeness\" and rudeboy culture, a Jamaican subculture.",

      "The artist is recognised for solo exhibition After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and the jury were impressed by his \"powerful representation\" of war and exile.",
      "His large-scale paintings explore memory and loss, layering patterns and colours to create \"haunting, dreamlike scenes\".",
      "Zadie Xa comes from Vancouver, Canada, and her work is inspired by her Korean heritage and the importance of shamanic beliefs.",
      "Interweaving paintings, murals, traditional patchwork textiles and 650 brass bells that make harmonised sounds inspired by Korean shamanic ritual bells, Xa's art focuses on the sea as \"a spiritual realm to explore traditions and folklore, speaking to a multitude of cultures\".",
      "The jury felt the \"vibrant installation\" was a \"sophisticated development\" of her work.",
      "'Speaks to our audiences'",
      "Established in 1984, the prize is named after radical painter JMW Turner - who would have turned 250 on Wednesday - and is awarded each year to a British-based  artist for an \"outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work\".",

      "\"Bradford has produced some amazing artists, literary artists, visual artists, contemporary artists,\" she told Radio 4.",

    "story": [
      "The relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway may have been happier than previously thought, according to new research.",
      "For more than 200 years it has been believed that Shakespeare left his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon when he travelled to London and that a decision to leave her almost nothing in his will meant he probably felt bitterness towards her.",
      "However, examination of a fragment of a letter, which is addressed to \"good Mrs Shakespeare\", appears to show they did live together in central London between 1600-1610.",
      "The research was carried out by Prof Matthew Steggle from the University of Bristol's Department of English.",
      "In the letter, which was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford, it is alleged that Shakespeare is withholding money from an orphan boy named John Butts, with the letter asking Mrs Shakespeare for money instead.",
      "Prof Steggle said: \"First discovered in 1978, the letter's been known for a while, but no-one could identify the names or places involved or see any reason to think that the Mr Shakespeare in the letter was necessarily William rather than anyone else of the same name in the general period.",
      "\"So, it's a story about the Shakespeares' marriage, really, as well as about Shakespeare's London contacts.",
      "\"And if the writing on the back of the letter is a reply, then it's also a story about the first ever bit of writing which can be attributed to Anne Hathaway.\"",
      "The letter refers to the boy being a fatherless apprentice and through his research Prof Steggle says there was only one person in London called John Butts who fits that criterion.",
      "The letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in that area.",
      "\"It at least doubles the number of letters known to be addressed to or sent from Shakespeare and his family,\" Prof Steggle said.",
      "\"Currently, there's only one known. It also shows a side of Shakespeare's London life that's not been known before, giving him a new address in Trinity Lane and a whole new sphere of activity for him.\"",
      "Prof Steggle said it \"opens the door\" to the idea Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend \"significant\" time with her husband in London.",
      "\"It's not a complete slam dunk,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It's a possibility that seems difficult to avoid, rather than a certainty.\"",
      "'They did love each other'",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, author Maggie O'Farrell, whose book Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the marriage between Shakespeare and his wife as they deal with the loss of their son, called the discovery \"thrilling\" and \"wonderful\".",
      "\"There have been very respected scholars who've said that she was ugly, that Shakespeare hated her, that she trapped him into marriage, that she was illiterate, that she was stupid,\" Ms O'Farrell said.",
      "\"There is absolutely not one shred of evidence for any of that and it's always baffled me as to why she attracts all this vilification and all this misogyny.",
      "\"And it's so wonderful to find this tiny fragment of a letter which was discovered in the binding of a book that was published in 1608, that proves of course that they did love each other and probably lived together for some time in London.\"",

      "\"The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday.",
      "In his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model.",
      "The former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.",
      "Attorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would \"fall flat on its face\" after they heard all the evidence.",
      "\"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,\" he said.",

      "Last week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".",
      "The retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them.",
      "Victims \"kept their shame and their pain to themselves\" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who \"defined the field\" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said.",
      "During his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having \"mutually beneficial\" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money.",
      "\"These women are addicted to that fame,\" Mr Aidala said. \"They want to be heroes.\"",
      "Mr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters.",
      "Last April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over.",
      "Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.",
      "He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.",
      "Weinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit.",
      "A judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court.",
      "His lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed.",
      "In total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women.",
      "He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence.",
      "The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.",
      "Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".",
      "Before the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.",
      "Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.",
      "His films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.",
      "The former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020."

    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.",
      "The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\"",
      "The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".",
      "However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".",
      "A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.",
      "Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\"",
      "However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.",
      "\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.",
      "But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.",
      "\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"",
      "Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.",
      "BBC suspension",
      "Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.",
      "The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.",
      "Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.",
      "\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"",
      "He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\"",
      "The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".",
      "The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".",
      "Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.",
      "While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.",
      "Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".",
      "\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"",
      "Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".",
      "The BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.",
      "The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".",
      "Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\"",
      "Gaza doc",
      "Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\"",
      "He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\".",
      "\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.",
      "The BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\".",
      "Gambling in sport",
      "In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.",
      "Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.",
      "\"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said.",
      "\"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere.",
      "\"I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.\"",
      "On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money.",
      "The 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now.",
      "\"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.\"",

    "story": [
      "The sister of James Lee Williams, better known as The Vivienne, says her family only learned of the drag performer's battle with ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK.",
      "In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Chanel Williams, 35, says James had kept the struggle - including being hospitalised because of the drug - a secret from the family \"to protect them\".",
      "The 32-year-old died in January, with the family later announcing the cause of death as a cardiac arrest caused by taking ketamine.",
      "Chanel says her brother had \"a really long period of sobriety\" before relapsing, something she says the family only discovered after James's death.",
      "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
      "\"A big thing for me now is, had I asked the questions or just looked for the signs, would the outcome be different?\" she says.",
      "The Vivienne was praised for speaking openly about ketamine abuse and the struggle of becoming sober while appearing on Drag Race UK, which aired in 2019.",
      "Chanel is now hoping to continue that legacy by campaigning to encourage people to talk openly about substance abuse.",
      "She believes the stigma around addiction, and her brother's successful career on stage and TV, meant James didn't seek professional help.",
      "\"He'd spoken openly on Drag Race about the battles he'd had with addiction, and he'd come through the other side of that,\" she says.",
      "\"He was at the height of everything he was doing and I think because he'd said it in such a open platform, it's really difficult to come back and say you're struggling again.\"",
      "Chanel says she's concerned about the rise in young people taking ketamine, which she believes is in part because the drug is cheap and easily accessible.",
      "James's body was found in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on 5 January.",
      "Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, and a post-mortem examination revealed an \"unnatural cause of death.\"",
      "A full inquest is scheduled for June 30. But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.",
      "Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.",
      "\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.",
      "\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.",
      "\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"",
      "Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.",
      "\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"",
      "The UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.",
      "A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.",
      "\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"",
      "Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".",
      "\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.",
      "\"If I can help one family to not feel what we are feeling, then it's all worth it.\"",

      "Other new champions were crowned amid further twists and surprises, but none more significant than the final match of the weekend.",
      "It was a historic night for many reasons, not least that this was the first WrestleMania to air live on Netflix, where it could be watched by many of the firm's 300 million subscribers around the world.",
      "The company paid a pretty penny for the privilege - a 10 year $5bn (\u00a34bn) deal to bring WWE's weekly shows and monthly events to the streaming service (though not all territories get to see everything).",
      "Netflix's experience airing WWE shows since January - it says the first live show picked up just shy of five million views - seemed to pay dividends as WrestleMania aired largely without glitches.",
      "And the firms had an even greater argument to make for its significance before the first bell was rung, when WWE announced it had acquired Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, one of the largest wrestling promotions in Mexico.",
      "But fans will say all of that is fine and dandy - what matters is what happens between the ropes.",
      "And on that front, there would be few who left disappointed.",
      "A family affair",
      "The show could be said to have two main events - one on Saturday and another on Sunday - and the first night's show featured three of WWE's biggest stars.",
      "Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and CM Punk met in a match the company billed as generational, in no small part due to the 46-year-old Punk finally getting to his first WrestleMania main event.",
      "The fans were firmly behind Punk to begin with, and the match lived up to the billing - a ferocious war with plenty of big moments and false finishes before a series of twists led to Rollins standing tall.",
      "The weekend had kicked off with a feel-good story as Jey Uso defeated Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship, the other major title men battle for in WWE.",
      "The more than 60,000 fans in attendance were not disappointed as Uso won his first ever world title to open the show on Saturday - in doing so, bettering the career achievements of his father, 90s and 00s wrestler Rikishi.",

      "Brand names written on the ring canvas and a sports drink brand synonymous with YouTuber-turned-wrestler Logan Paul, who faced AJ Styles on Sunday, have become a common part of WWE furniture in recent years.",
      "But this WrestleMania seemed to pack in the ads far more than previous years, with one fan saying it was \"challenging to even focus\" on the action, and another even calling it \"Ad-a-Mania\".",
      "The adverts were even embedded into elements of the presentation itself, with multiple wrestlers making their way to the ring in special costumes designed to promote video games.",
      "And all that's before the ad breaks which split up the event.",
      "But it's worth remembering that for those who already had a Netflix subscription, this is the first WrestleMania they won't have had to shell out any extra money to see.",
      "While this event is often billed as a showpiece on par with cup finals, there is one big difference - tomorrow, WWE will continue on with the next chapter of its never-ending soap opera.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.",
      "As a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.",
      "She says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".",
      "But Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.",
      "\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.",
      "\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"",
      "Knowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.",
      "\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.",
      "\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"",
      "None of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.",
      "\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.",
      "In the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.",
      "The band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.",
      "Knowles, who ran a hair salon Headliners and had learned dressmaking, made costumes for the group, while Mathew Knowles quit his job to manage them.",
      "Their daughters have gone on to forge hugely successful solo careers.",
      "Solange won a Grammy Award for Cranes in the Sky, while Beyonc\u00e9 has had countless hits including Single Ladies, Crazy in Love, Halo and Irreplaceable.",
      "She finally won best album at this year's Grammy Awards - correcting what was widely seen as an historic wrong.",
      "The star was recognised for her eighth album, Cowboy Carter, which celebrates and contextualises the black roots of country music.",
      "Why Beyonc\u00e9 is reclaiming country music",
      "Why Beyonc\u00e9 is reclaiming country music",
      "In an Instagram post ahead of her album launch, Beyonc\u00e9 said Cowboy Carter was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcome\" that prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".",
      "Many interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.",
      "Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.",
      "\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.",
      "She added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.",
      "\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"",
      "As her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.",
      "There was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.",
      "Knowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.",
      "But when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.",
      "\u201cThey are very astute at blocking out the bull and the lies. And do they hurt them? Sure, but they don't even focus on that,\" she says.",
      "\"While the world is creating lies and mess, my girls are somewhere in the studio or with their kids minding their business and living their best life.\"",
      "She refuses to take credit for keeping her daughters grounded.",
      "\"I didn't keep them on the straight and narrow. They are just very sensible people with balance in their life,\" she says.",

      "She is now cancer free.",
      "\"My daughters and my faith carried me through,\" she writes.",
      "The next generation of superstars?",
      "So what's next for this family of superstars?",
      "Knowles is optimistic, saying \"the sky's the limit\" when it comes to what her daughters might do next.",
      "As for her grandchildren, she says they are being nurtured in \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed in the show business\".",
      "At just 13, Blue Ivy has already made strides in her career. Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.",
      "But Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to \"work for\".",
      "\"Because her mum was like, no, you got time. You got to make sure that, you know, a lot comes with that.",
      "\"And so if anything, they're being nurtured to be the best human beings they can be. That's first priority.\"",
      "As for whether we can expect Matriarch to be adapted into a reality series, Knowles is reticent.",
      "\"Oh, not a reality series, but you know, I have been talking to people about the movie rights to it and I would love to see a film made,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "Last year, Alfie Watts went global, becoming the youngest ever winner of Race Across the World - the BBC show that does exactly what it says on the tin.",
      "Teams of two race to get from one part of the world to another with no air travel, no smartphones, no bank cards and a limited cash budget.",
      "After 50 days spent travelling by land and sea from Japan to Indonesia alongside his St Albans schoolfriend Owen Wood, it all came down to a foot race by a beach off the island of Lombok.",
      "The series four finale saw the pair pip mother and daughter duo Eugenie and Isabel by a mere eight minutes to take the title and \u00a320,000 prize pot.",
      "It also saw Alfie catch the travel bug, sending him on his way to a new career as a travel guru and online content creator.",
      "As series five of the show gets underway on Wednesday, BBC News speaks to the 21-year-old about his new life on the road, advice for fellow travellers and tips for this year's contestants on how to win the show.",
      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling \"further afield\".",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",
      "Since his big TV win, Watts has been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.",
      "Another time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.",
      "And he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Wood for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.",
      "Watts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.",
      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\", responsibly.",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",
      "He does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.",
      "\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"",
      "Bucket list",
      "His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.",
      "One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.",
      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled (and able to offer visa guidance to his followers), the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways; acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK - a mental health charity for young people - and Winston's Wish - a children and young people's grief charity.",
      "One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.",
      "Speaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].",
      "\"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"",
      "Race Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.",
      "They include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.",
      "The rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.",
      "Watts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and a \"topsy-turvy\" series.",
      "\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"",
      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",
      "He also suggests hacks like packing \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.",
      "\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.",
      "\"And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.\"",
      "Is he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?",
      "He replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who \"nicely interact\" with the others and \"who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel\" to win.",
      "\"I think those are always the people that you want to do best, and if that happens to be the two 18-year-olds this time, then I'll be happy to hand my crown over.\"",

    "summary": "Ethiopia's answer to The Bachelor has prompted discussions about dating norms in the conservative country.",
    "story": [
      "Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.",
      "If you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.",
      "But in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention.",
      "Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.",
      "Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).",
      "Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.",
      "Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.",
      "Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.",
      "Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".",
      "Of course, not everyone feels the same way.",
      "\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.",
      "\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"",
      "Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.",
      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",
      "\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"",
      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",
      "Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.",
      "\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.",
      "Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.",
      "By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.",
      "\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.",
      "\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"",
      "She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"",
      "Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"",
      "A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"",
      "Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.",
      "This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.",
      "\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.",
      "As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.",
      "\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.",
      "But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".",
      "She is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.",
      "\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.",
      "\"It is a new way of seeing.\"",

      "Self Esteem is A Complicated Woman",
      "By Mark Savage, music correspondent",
      "\"This album is going to get terrible reviews,\" Self Esteem predicted when I caught up with her last Christmas.",
      "Why? \"Because people hate women doing well,\" she laughed. \"I'm very ready for a male journalist to say it doesn't make sense, because it's a lot.\"",
      "That's kind of the point, though. Out on Friday, A Complicated Woman is an attempt to capture womanhood in all its complexities and contradictions \u2013 and that means moving through musical genres, modes and attitudes with almost whiplash-inducing speed.",
      "But Self Esteem, aka Rebecca Lucy Taylor, is too clever to mess it up. Her trademark wit and sincerity are firmly in place, as she talks candidly about social anxiety, crises of confidence, infantilised men, her least favourite sexual positions and being beaten down for speaking up.",
      "Highlights include The Curse, a stadium-sized ballad about using alcohol as an emotional crutch; and closing track The Deep Blue Okay, where she eventually finds a modicum of inner peace. Along the way, there are guest appearances from Nadine Shah, Moonchild Sanelly and even Coronation Street's Julie Hesmondhalgh.",
      "She launched the album with a flashy West End residency last week \u2013 where fans were delighted to discover that A Complicated Woman was an uncomplicated delight.",

      "Luigi Mangione's case went viral after he was charged with killing healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in New York City in December.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges.",
      "Some on social media have celebrated the 26-year-old, and shared anger at America's private health insurers.",
      "So what are the facts, and what are the conspiracies?",
      "The Mangione Trial, on BBC Sounds, aims to unpick this. The latest episode drops on Wednesday, and looks at how the US healthcare system works.",
      "It hears from a mother who says she spent $40,000 (\u00a330,000) on her daughter's treatment while also battling for her insurance to cover it.",
      "Future episodes will dive into what conspiracy theories are, and why people become so obsessed with them.",
      "Defying destiny in Clair Obscur and Until Dawn",
      "By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter",
      "Dark fantasy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, out Thursday for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Game Pass, quite literally caught people's eyes when it was first revealed at last year's Summer Game Fest.",
      "As video games go, it's a stunner, with gorgeous art direction heavily inspired by France's 19th century Belle \u00c9poque era.",
      "Players control a crew of characters on a quest to destroy the Paintress \u2013 a being who emerges once a year and scrawls a number onto a monolith. If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title).",
      "Somehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English.",
      "But the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.",
      "If that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptation Until Dawn is out in cinemas on Friday. Passionate fans of the 2015 \"interactive horror movie\" were concerned when the first trailer revealed the film's makers had swapped the game's trademark choose-your-own-adventure device for a Happy Death Day-style time loop.",
      "But with Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation director David F Sandberg and prolific horror writer Gary Dauberman on board, and a buzzy cast including Love, Victor star Michael Cimino and up-and-comer Ella Rubin, Until Dawn's fate isn't necessarily sealed yet.",

    "summary": "The singer describes the troubled gestation of her third album, as she launches it on the West End.",
    "story": [
      "\"Please be upstanding for the world's most confusing House of Games contestant and Bake Off failure, Self Esteem!\"",
      "This is how Rebecca Lucy Taylor \u2013 aka celebrated pop singer Self Esteem \u2013 is introduced to the stage at London's Duke of York's Theatre.",
      "It's a typically irreverent comment, an example of the dry wit she uses to sweeten the sincerity and anger of her music.",
      "\"You can take piccies and videos,\" the off-stage voice continues, \"because she needs all the help she can get.\"",
      "That, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.",
      "Three years ago, Taylor released her second album, Prioritise Pleasure, a body-shaking manifesto for female self-worth that bristled at society's expectations while acknowledging her own shortcomings (\"Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counterproductive,\" she observed on Moody).",
      "After 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.",
      "There were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off \u2013 where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.",
      "\"The week that Prioritise Pleasure came out, my whole life changed,\" she reflects.",
      "\"Not financially or in terms of fame, but it's like there was a knot in my stomach that untied.",
      "\"Then everyone was like, 'Right, can you do that again, please?'\"",
      "Taylor tore herself in two to make the follow-up, A Complicated Woman, which comes out on Friday.",
      "After playing it live for the first time in the West End on Wednesday, she describes the album's gestation process as \"horrible\", \"lonely\", and \"painful\".",
      "\"It just felt really stressful to execute what was in my head,\" she explains in a phone interview the next morning.",
      "\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"",
      "Part of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.",
      "\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.",
      "\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.",
      "\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"",
      "It all unravels",
      "She hasn't just made a new album - she has also created a daring, jaw-dropping theatrical experience to go with it.",
      "It's set in a sparse recreation of the community centre where eight-year-old Becky from Rotherham learned to tap dance.",
      "\"You just wanted to sing / You didn't know what that would bring,\" recalls an older, more cynical version of that child \u2013 as she assesses her life at the age of 38.",
      "\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\"",
      "As the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.",
      "Initially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.",
      "\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.",
      "\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"",
      "A four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.",
      "Several times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.",
      "\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?",
      "\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"",
      "In the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.",
      "The music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention.",
      "A Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.",
      "\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?",
      "\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"",
      "\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"",
      "That's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.",
      "Recent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.",
      "\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs.",
      "\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.",
      "\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"",
      "Those moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.",
      "Her personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.",
      "\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap.",
      "\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"",
      "It's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised.",
      "As excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.",
      "\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.",
      "\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"",
      "Eventually, the criticism took its toll.",
      "\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.",
      "\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.",
      "\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"",
      "That realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.",
      "Life is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.",
      "She sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"",
      "On stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.",
      "It's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.",
      "\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"",
      "With that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.",
      "\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.",
      "\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.",
      "\"But last night I was like, 'Bloody hell, you did what you set out to do'. So I'm good.\"",

      "While it's difficult to pin their recent rise in popularity to one particular ingredient, celebrity endorsement, social media unboxing videos and their ability to stir up nostalgia are all contributing factors.",
      "James Welsh, from Hampshire, sees his Labubu collectable as an investment, which he tells the BBC \"could probably earn a fair bit of money two or three years down the line\".",
      "He has just shy of 30 Labubus which retail at around \u00a325 for an individual toy or \u00a3153 for a box of six.",

      "The company, which started 15 years ago, has been described as \"elevating toy buying to an act of trendy connoisseurship\" and praised for embracing non-traditional designs, which have made them a hit with collectors.",
      "Artist Kasing Lung is behind some of their popular toys including The Monsters series and Labubu.",
      "He credits living in The Netherlands as the inspiration behind the dolls and told Hypbeast \"I liked to read storybooks and was influenced by ancient European elf legends\".",
      "Lung added that during his childhood, \"there were no game consoles or computers, so I had to draw dolls with a pen, so I had the idea of painting fairy tales since I was a child\".",
      "He first came up with the designs in 2015 and signed a licensing agreement with Pop Mart in 2019 to make them into toys.",
      "Labubu as a name has no specific meaning, it is a fictional character based around an elf-like creature.",
      "James says his first thought when he saw the one of the toys was, \"they're creepy but they're also really cute and I need as many of them as I can get, I need them in every colour\".",
      "The 36-year-old adds, \"I think they [provide] some real escapism for millennials as it's like reverting back to your youth with these toys and collectables.\"",
      "A former stylist, he now primarily creates beauty and skincare content, but has recently gained thousands of views on his channel from Labubu unboxing videos.",
      "He tells the BBC: \"there is a strong link between these plush pendants and the fashion community as well.\"",
      "\"They're a way to express who you are, you can show that through the different characters, which add a pop of colour and fashion is fun, it's not serious at the end of the day, it's reflective of who you are.\"",

      "But for collectors such as 22-year-old Chulie, who shares her purchases on TikTok, she says Labubu becoming a \"fashion trend\" misses the point of why they're so loved.",
      "\"For me, it's all about the nostalgia and the surprise aspect,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "One of Pop Mart's biggest selling points for collectors is the way their toys are packaged in what's known as blind boxes, which make the experience of getting one like a lucky dip.",
      "You don't know what character you are getting until you unseal the package, so it's always a gamble for collectors.",
      "\"You know it's fun, it's a dopamine hit\", James says.",
      "\"It's gambling for some of us - kind of like a happy meal, you don't know what toy you're getting until you open it up.\"",
      "It also makes the toy perfect for the world of social media, as creators can catch their genuine surprise on camera and share it with other fans - something James says provides comfort and \"escapism from the real world\".",
      "Chulie says, as a child, she would collect Pokemon trading cards, so collecting another surprise item \"triggered memories for me\".",
      "\"When you're having a rough time, especially for me personally, it's a big serotonin boost to not only buy a collectable and keep it, but share the experience with other people as well,\" she adds.",

      "For some fans, just documenting the experience of getting a Labubu is a talking point, with many showing the long queues and hours of research required to find out where new collections are being stocked.",
      "It's prompted backlash on some social media channels, with users criticising collectors that have bought large numbers of items.",

      "The Netflix/WWE deal reflects changes in viewing habits, and also speaks to WWE's eagerness to be promoted by the \"winner of the streaming wars\", the Wrestlenomics website editor Brandon Thurston tells the BBC.",
      "After years of relying on cable pay-per-view  - which charged US viewers a hefty $60 (\u00a345) per event - WWE launched its own network in 2014. The company took most of its pay-per-view events in house, aware that half the revenue was being lost to satellite companies.",
      "The move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (\u00a37.50), creating \"a larger audience than ever\".",
      "The Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets.",
      "As WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal \"simplicity\" felt game-changing: \"No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in\".",
      "Good thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have \"no concept\" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.",
      "It's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network.",
      "\"Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,\" says Paul.",
      "\"It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him\".",
      "And he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks.",
      "The picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included.",
      "However, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA.",
      "And figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events.",
      "Regardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records.",
      "'Boots on the ground'",
      "When former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture.",
      "That's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee.",
      "\"We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,\" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, \"all forms of entertainment rolled into one\".",
      "And yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims.",
      "Thurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.",
      "For Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's \"bra and panties match\" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. \"Back then, women were just eye candy,\" he says. \"Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men.\"",
      "This shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania. Top stars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, and IYO SKY are to face off in a triple-threat match, while women's champion Tiffany Stratton will fight the legendary Charlotte Flair - in a battle that underlines the division's growing value.",
      "Attracting new audiences matters, Thurston says, because WWE's global strategy now hinges on fees paid by cities hosting these events (including WrestleMania), both inside and outside the USA.",
      "\"They want WrestleMania to become like the World Cup or Olympics, where there's a bidding war,\" he explains. \"Las Vegas is paying them $5 million for this year's event,\" he adds, noting that London has been heavily touted as a potential WrestleMania host city.",
      "Netflix's 'Sportainment' bet",
      "Finding a home on a streaming giant may be great news for WWE - but what does Netflix stand to gain from the partnership?",
      "According to James English, managing partner at sports and entertainment marketing agency Fuse, Netflix is \"stating loud and clear that it wants to dominate 'sportainment'\".",
      "Netflix has no input into making of WWE, says Triple H",
      "The WWE streaming deal is, he says, a major reason why Netflix beat expectations with its financial figures on Thursday, delivering 13% revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025.",
      "English sees WrestleMania as the natural progression in their drive to use sport to attract viewers to \"cultural moments\".",
      "This began last November with Mike Tyson taking on YouTuber Jake Paul in an influencer-boxing hybrid bout that drew in 60 million households - perhaps benefitting from cross-generational appeal.",
      "This first foray into live sports attracted complaints of crashing and buffering but the issues were largely fixed for Netflix's two NFL matches on Christmas Day a month later, part of a new three-year deal to show Christmas Day fixtures.",
      "English says that unlike Apple or Amazon Prime, which bought packages to the Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League, Netflix's focus on \"event\" viewing allows them to make best use of their personalised advert and interface data.",
      "WrestleMania exemplifies this strategy. As a \"live, global, fan-driven deal that blends sports, entertainment and storytelling\", English says Netflix could stand to make huge profits from its WWE partnership.",
      "The big question, of course, is whether wider Netflix audience interest will last the rounds.",
      "But it may be a gamble worth taking - for all involved. Just ask Oliver and his Dad at midnight."

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 06:09:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted.",
      "Earlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.",
      "Actors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.",
      "Their performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.",
      "'Suspend disbelief'",
      "Perhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era.",
      "On the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double).",
      "But on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".",
      "So should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?",
      "Beatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism.",
      "\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief.",
      "\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"",
      "Du Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.",
      "\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"",
      "But he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.",
      "\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"",
      "So does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?",
      "Du Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch.",
      "\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"",
      "'Don't hear it any more'",
      "Edda Sharpe, a voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.",
      "Among them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.",
      "Beatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it.",
      "The performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.",
      "\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.",
      "\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"",
      "She said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.",
      "But she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.",
      "\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.",
      "\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"",
      "'More Scouse'",
      "Dr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.",
      "He said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.",
      "\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.",
      "\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.",
      "\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"",
      "But what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films?",
      "Michael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.",
      "Hawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can.",
      "\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.",
      "\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.",
      "\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"",
      "The 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.",
      "He added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.",
      "\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.",
      "Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.",
      "\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"",
      "His voice tails off, full of emotion.",
      "\"I thought I was going to die.\"",
      "Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.",
      "\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.",
      "But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".",
      "Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.",
      "As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.",
      "An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.",
      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".",
      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",

      "The 32-year-old died in January, with the family later announcing the cause of death as a cardiac arrest caused by taking ketamine.",
      "Chanel says her brother had \"a really long period of sobriety\" before relapsing, something she says the family only discovered after James's death.",
      "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
      "\"A big thing for me now is, had I asked the questions or just looked for the signs, would the outcome be different?\" she says.",
      "The Vivienne was praised for speaking openly about ketamine abuse and the struggle of becoming sober while appearing on Drag Race UK, which aired in 2019.",
      "Chanel is now hoping to continue that legacy by campaigning to encourage people to talk openly about substance abuse.",
      "She believes the stigma around addiction, and her brother's successful career on stage and TV, meant James didn't seek professional help.",
      "\"He'd spoken openly on Drag Race about the battles he'd had with addiction, and he'd come through the other side of that,\" she says.",
      "\"He was at the height of everything he was doing and I think because he'd said it in such a open platform, it's really difficult to come back and say you're struggling again.\"",
      "Chanel says she's concerned about the rise in young people taking ketamine, which she believes is in part because the drug is cheap and easily accessible.",
      "James's body was found in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on 5 January.",
      "Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, and a post-mortem examination revealed an \"unnatural cause of death.\"",
      "A full inquest is scheduled for June 30. But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.",
      "Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.",
      "\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.",
      "\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.",
      "\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"",
      "Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.",
      "\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"",
      "The UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.",
      "A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.",
      "\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"",
      "Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".",
      "\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:17:45 GMT",
    "summary": "In an NHS survey, 48% of men said they felt pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Dan Somers started to experience a series of strange and unexplained symptoms. He had severe chest pain, was unable to keep food or even water down and kept \"chucking up bile\".",
      "Though he had a sense that something might be wrong, Dan was reluctant to seek medical help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. \"I didn't want to be a burden.\"",
      "Dan's pain continued to get worse, until he was \"near enough screaming on the floor in pain\" and had to take time off work. It was the worst pain he's ever experienced, he says upon reflection.",
      "But \"I honestly thought I could try and fix it,\" Dan recalls.",
      "It was his wife who finally managed to push Dan to see the doctor.",
      "His GP sent him straight to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and spent a week recovering. He was told he had been close to getting sepsis.",
      "Dan's story mirrors those of other men who've told the BBC they've also put off seeking medical treatment - often until their symptoms became unbearable or until a loved one pushed them to get help.",
      "It's well known that men go to the doctors less than women, and data backs this up.",
      "The NHS told the BBC it doesn't release demographic data about GP appointments. But according to the ONS Health Insight Survey from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.",
      "Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and \"rarely or never\" used a pharmacy, too.",
      "They also make up considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.",
      "Men are \"less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function,\" says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.",
      "This all affects men's health outcomes.",
      "Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.",
      "In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.",
      "Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. \"Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves\".",
      "\"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns,\" says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.",
      "\"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need,\" she adds.",
      "'Men are inherent problem-solvers'",
      "Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.",
      "\"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem,\" says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.",
      "This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report \"self-managing\" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.",
      "\"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence,\" Prof Galdas says.",
      "Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.",
      "Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.",
      "Women, in contrast, are \"sort of forced to engage in the health system\" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.",
      "And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.",
      "Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.",
      "And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, less likely to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme. As Prof Galdas says: \"men often seek help when symptoms disrupt their ability to function.\"",
      "'Massive waste of time'",
      "For Jonathan Anstee, 54, from Surrey, it took his symptoms getting drastically worse for him to book a doctors appointment, after months of stomach aches and blood in his stool.",
      "\"The pain got a lot worse and the blood got a lot worse,\" Jonathan says. \"But even when I went to the doctors, I was sat in the waiting room thinking 'this is a massive waste of time'.\"",
      "He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2022.",
      "Throughout his life he'd generally avoided doctors appointments, Jonathan says. And as a father, \"you're used to worrying about your kids and not yourself,\" he says. Going to the doctors for himself, not his children, seemed \"a bit sort of indulgent\", he says.",
      "Last year, Jonathan was told his bowel cancer was stage four.",
      "Having blood in his stool had felt too embarrassing to talk to his friends and family about at the time. Jonathan's advice to other men is: \"There is absolutely no need to be embarrassed. The alternative could kill you - literally.\"",
      "'Connection can make a big difference'",
      "In recent years, support groups for men with cancer and mental health conditions have sprung up.",
      "Matthew Wiltshire started the men's charity the Cancer Club after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. He died in 2023.",
      "Matthew felt there wasn't a space \"where men were openly talking about what it's like to go through cancer,\" his son, Oliver Wiltshire, says. \"He also noticed how much of the emotional load was being carried by the women around him.\"",
      "Through the Cancer Club, men can message online and attend sports events together.",
      "\"Whether it's practical advice, honest chat or just knowing someone else gets it, that connection can make a big difference,\" Oliver adds.",
      "Experts say that while men's attitudes towards healthcare are gradually changing for the better, more work still needs to be done.",
      "Prof Galdas believes men will engage more if services are redesigned to meet their needs - proactively offering support, having flexible access and focusing on practical action to improve mental health issues.",
      "\"There's good evidence from gender-responsive programmes in mental health, cancer care, and health checks showing this consistently,\" he says.",
      "For Dr Pillon, it's adding general health checks for men in their 20s to get them more used to accessing medical care.",
      "They're already available through the NHS for people aged 40 to 74, but introducing them for younger men who might not otherwise go to the doctors would \"embed the idea that you can come and use health services\", he says.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:04:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Blind influencer Lucy Edwards on choosing IVF which will screen out the gene that made her who she is.",
    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",
      "\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"",

    "summary": "The PM says the Supreme Court ruling brought clarity and now is the time to \"lower the temperature\" on the debate.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of lacking \"moral courage\" on transgender issues during heated exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions.",
      "Last week, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman should be based on biological sex under equalities law, meaning, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "Sir Keir said the court's ruling provided \"clarity\" and that it was now \"time to lower the temperature\" on the debate.",
      "Badenoch said the prime minister didn't \"have the balls\" to say where he stood and likened him to a \"weather vane\".",
      "\"This is a choice between a Conservative Party that stood up for common sense and a Labour Party that bent the knee to every passing fad,\" she said.",
      "\"This is a question about moral courage, about doing the right thing even when it is difficult.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Sir Keir's spokesman said the prime minister did not believe transgender women were women.",
      "That contrasted with comments he made in 2022, when he told the Times \"a woman is a female adult, and in addition to that transwomen are women, and that is not just my view - that is actually the law\".",
      "In the first Prime Minister's Questions since the Supreme Court's ruling, Badenoch used all six of her questions to press the prime minister on the issue.",
      "She asked if he would apologise to Rosie Duffield, the MP who left Labour last year  and whom Badenoch said had been \"hounded out\" of the party.",

      "\"That will never be my approach.\"",
      "Last year, Sir Keir and Sunak rowed over a transgender comment the latter made on the day Esther Ghey - the mother of murdered transgender teenage Brianna - was visiting Parliament.",
      "During PMQs, Sir Keir sought to attack Badenoch's record, accusing her of doing \"nothing\" when she was women and equalities minister.",
      "Badenoch defended her record, telling MPs she had helped commission the Cass review into gender identity services for young people, and blocked the Gender Recognition Reform Bill in Scotland.",
      "In contrast, she said Labour MPs were questioning the Supreme Court's ruling.",

      "He added that the prime minister would \"completely condemn\" death threats received by the For Women Scotland who brought the Supreme Court legal case, adding they were \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said her approach on the subject had \"evolved\".",
      "\"My understanding of the law until this [Supreme Court] ruling was that it made provision for people who had been through the gender recognition process and  transitioned to a different gender to be recognised in that gender in legal terms.",

    "summary": "UK negotiators are working \"flat out\" to get a trade deal with the US, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says.",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports as she tries to broker a trade deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Reeves said she wants \"to see tariff and non-tariff barriers reduced between the UK and the US\".",
      "The UK is seeking to lower trade taxes imposed by President Donald Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports.",
      "One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.",
      "Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.",
      "The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.",
      "President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US \u2013 including from the UK.",
      "The UK is also facing a broader tariff rate of 10%, and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",
      "UK negotiators are working \"flat out\" to get an agreement that is in the country's national interest, Reeves told the BBC at an event in Washington.",
      "\"We are willing to reduce trade barriers in the UK, those trade barriers that do exist. And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",
      "Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".",
      "But she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".",
      "\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.",
      "Reeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".",
      "\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.",
      "Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.",
      "The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.",
      "Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".",
      "He said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.",
      "\"It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,\" he said.",
      "China sends Boeing planes back to US over tariffs",
      "Trump hints at softening China tariffs and says no plan to sack Fed boss",
      "US growth forecast to be hit hardest from Trump tariffs, IMF says",
      "Trump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.",
      "These include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.",
      "The move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.",
      "Prices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.",
      "The IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.",
      "On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".",
      "However, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"",
      "She said the UK \"is not one of those countries\" so \"there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US\".",
      "She added that she understood \"the need to rebalance the global economy\".",
      "This, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\" she said.",
      "This mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.",
      "It is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.",
      "The removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.",
      "Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".",
      "The UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review."

      "The Conservative leader has always ruled out an electoral pact with Reform UK, arguing that Nigel Farage's party is seeking to destroy the Tories.",
      "In a leaked recording obtained by Sky News, Jenrick said he wanted the \"fight\" against Labour at the next general election to be \"united\" and he was \"determined\" to \"bring this coalition together\".",
      "Asked about Jenrick's comments on Wednesday, Reform leader Farage told GB News: \"I think my supporters would be revolted.\"",
      "The story was seized on by Labour and the Lib Dems, who urged Badenoch to sack her former leadership rival for contradicting her - but her spokesman insisted there were no differences between them.",
      "\"Kemi Badenoch has made perfectly clear there will be absolutely no electoral pact with Reform.",
      "\"If you actually read the shadow justice secretary's words, he is saying he is working to defeat Reform. The coalition he's talking about is of centre-right voters and bringing them together,\" the spokesman told reporters.",
      "Asked if Badenoch considered Jenrick a \"team player\", the spokesman said: \"Yes, the shadow cabinet is a well-functioning team.\"",
      "He said Badenoch had not been aware of Jenrick's comments ahead of them being obtained by Sky, but it was \"demonstrably true\" that the right is not \"united\" and that the Tories needed to get millions of voters back from Reform UK.",
      "And he hit back at claims Badenoch, who beat Jenrick to the Tory crown in a vote of members last November, should \"rein him in\" for writing articles and speeches that went beyond his shadow ministerial brief.",
      "\"It is fine for shadow cabinet members and MPs to talk about things that are in the advancement of the Conservative Party,\" he told reporters.",
      "The Tory leader struck a similarly relaxed tone when asked by the BBC if Jenrick was undermining her leadership with his comments on Reform.",
      "\"No, not at all,\" she replied.",
      "\"I mean we have to be realistic. The Conservatives lost a lot of seats not just because of Labour doing better, but because we lost a lot of votes to Reform so of course we want those voters to come back to us, just as the ones who went to the Lib Dems and Labour we want them to come back to us.\"",
      "She added that the party could only tempt voters back with a \"visibly centre-right, authentic Conservative offer\".",
      "Farage was equally unenthusiastic about the potential for a deal with either Jenrick or the Tories, telling GB News: \"I can only deal with people who I could trust. I don't trust them.\"",
      "He added: \"We had 14 years of the Conservative party.",
      "\"Tax is the highest since 1947, the state growing, the civil service growing, mass immigration at levels even Tony Blair couldn't dream of.",

      "The PM hit back, saying no Tory MPs thought she would be the Conservative leader at the next general election.",
      "He added that Jenrick - who was absent from the chamber - was \"away plotting,\" and that he would be left \"fighting over the bones of the Tory party\" with Nigel Farage, who he said would \"eat the Tory party for breakfast\".",
      "In the recording at the centre of the controversy, which was made in March this years at a local Tory event, Jenrick can be heard talking about how Reform UK could make life difficult for his party.",
      "\"You head towards a general election, where the nightmare scenario is that Keir Starmer sails in through the middle as a result of the two parties being disunited.",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I'm not prepared for that to happen.\"",

      "It comes after last week's Supreme Court ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "Shortlists of candidates that only include women have been used by some parties since the mid-1990s to increase female representation. Labour introduced all-women shortlists (AWS) to select half of its candidates in winnable seats ahead of the 1997 general election.",

      "The EHRC has previously said it was an \"anomaly\" that a trans woman (who was born male) could access a women-only shortlist but a trans man (who was born female) could not.",
      "Likewise, it said there was a discrepancy between trans women who had a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC), who could legally be on a shortlist, but trans women without one who could not.",
      "A GRC is a legal document that recognises an individual's gender identity.",
      "It is understood that the ruling that sex is biological will make it clear that such shortlists are only open to those who were born female.",

      "Labour suspended its use of all-women shortlists for the 2024 general election because the parliamentary party had more female MPs than males.",

      "The SNP, which used AWS for Scottish Parliament elections in 2021, is currently not using them because a source says women are no longer under-represented in Holyrood.",
      "The use of AWS is not party policy for the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats,  the Green Party of England and Wales or Reform UK.",

    "story": [
      "The transport secretary has pledged to reduce the number of learner drivers in England waiting more than five months to sit practical tests.",
      "Heidi Alexander said the government would aim to clear the backlog by next summer, providing at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month to help tackle the issue.",
      "Current driving test wait times are \"totally unacceptable\", she told parliament's transport committee on Wednesday.",
      "There is a minimum six-month wait to book a driving test in several areas of the UK, according to data from the AA.",
      "The transport secretary said the new measures would help reduce average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026.",
      "It means the government is set to miss its original target for waiting times by up eight months.",
      "The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) had planned on cutting waiting times to seven weeks by the end of this year. It has blamed an \"increase in demand and a change in customers' booking behaviour\" for the backlog.",
      "In order to tackle the delays, Alexander revealed plans to double training capacity so more driving examiners would be available.",
      "She said she was also asking those in other DVSA roles who are qualified, but not longer examine, to temporarily \"return to the frontline\".",
      "She said it would also reintroduce overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests.",
      "A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, but the government would now consult on changes to the test booking system, Alexander added.",
      "Six-month driving test waits in some areas, AA says",
      "Driving test backlog sees exams sold for over \u00a3200",
      "Three quarters of driving test centres hit maximum wait time",

      "Millie said she had been held back by the delay and was \"hopeful\" she would pass her long-awaited first try in July.",
      "The wait for a test used to be a mere 10 weeks, according to driving instructor Sue Howe.",
      "\"But since Covid, it's just so difficult to get a test,\" she told the BBC on Wednesday.",
      "The instructor from Swindon said a shortage of examiners was to blame: \"If they're short of examiners, they just can't produce the tests.\"",
      "Emma Bush, managing director of AA Driving School, welcomed the \"further details of how the DVSA will meet its target waiting time of seven weeks by the end of the year\".",
      "\"Learner drivers have been dealing with frustratingly long waiting times to book a driving test since the easing of pandemic related restrictions several years ago,\" she said.",
      "\"Many people, particularly young people, need to pass their driving test for their job or to access education. Unblocking the system by creating extra tests will help ensure people are not being held back due to a lack of a driving licence.\""

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, his official spokesman has said.",
      "It comes after the UK Supreme Court ruled last week that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "In March 2022, when he was leader of the opposition, Sir Keir told the Times that \"a woman is a female adult, and in addition to that transwomen are women, and that is not just my view - that is actually the law\".",
      "Asked if Sir Keir still believed that a transgender woman was a woman, the PM's official spokesman said: \"No, the Supreme Court judgment has made clear that when looking at the Equality Act, a woman is a biological woman.\"",
      "The spokesman added: \"That is set out clearly by the court judgment.\"",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having U-turned in reaction to the judgement, accusing Labour ministers of needing the Supreme Court to tell them what to think on the issue.",
      "Pressed over when the PM had changed his mind earlier, his spokesman insisted the Labour government had been consistent that single-sex spaces \"are protected in law\".",
      "The ruling also makes it clear that a person who was born male but identifies as a woman does not have the right to use spaces or services designated as for women only.",
      "Westminster's tortuous battle with the gender question",
      "The Supreme Court ruling gives clarity - but now comes the difficult part",
      "Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman... in 65 seconds",
      "The spokesman stressed the PM had repeatedly said \"a woman is an adult female\" before the court judgment.",
      "In 2023, Sir Keir told The Sunday Times that for \"99.9%\" of women \"of course they haven't got a penis\".",
      "Later that year he told BBC Radio 5 Live \"a woman is an adult female\".",
      "And in April 2024 he said Rosie Duffield, who quit the party last year, was right to say \"only women have a cervix\", telling ITV: \"Biologically, she of course is right about that.\"",
      "Sir Keir had previously been critical of Duffield's views on trans people when she was a Labour MP, saying in 2021 that she was \"not right\" to say only women have a cervix.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir would now use a trans woman's preferred pronouns, the spokesman declined to comment on \"hypotheticals\" but insisted the PM had \"been clear that trans women should be treated with the same dignity and respect as anyone else\".",
      "Earlier on Tuesday Sir Keir welcomed the court's decision, saying it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance.",
      "In his first public comments since the ruling last week, the PM told ITV West Country: \"We need to move and make sure that we now ensure that all guidance is in the right place according to that judgment.\"",
      "Asked if he does not believe a transwoman is a woman, he said: \"A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear.\"",
      "During a Commons debate on the ruling on Monday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson welcomed the \"added clarity\" of the ruling and said the government would work to \"protect single-sex spaces based on biological sex\".",
      "But Badenoch attacked Labour ministers' previous record, accusing them of being \"so desperate to jump on a bandwagon that they abandoned common sense\".",
      "\"I know what a woman is and I always have,\" she said. \"The people of this country know what a woman is.",
      "\"We didn't need the Supreme Court to tell us that - but this government did.\"",
      "Badenoch added: \"The idea that they have supported this all along is for the birds... They have never said this before, this is a U-turn, but we welcome it.\"",
      "Earlier, Phillipson was pressed over whether a trans woman should use a women's toilet or a men's toilet.",
      "\"That should be on the basis of biological sex - that would apply right across the board to all single-sex provision,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"But the EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] will be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate and respect their privacy and dignity.\"",
      "Phillipson added that \"many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate cubicles that can be used by anyone\".",
      "Asked whether there was unity in the Labour Party about this issue, she replied: \"I speak for the government on this matter and I can be crystal clear with you that we welcome the ruling.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs will be uneasy about the comments from Sir Keir and Phillipson, although frustration did not seem to extend to being willing to criticise the government, but instead expressing concern about anxieties within the trans, non-binary and intersex community.",
      "In the debate following Phillipson's statement, Labour's Emily Thornberry said LGBT helpline calls had \"skyrocketed in recent days\" and highlighted that \"the overwhelming threat to women and to all of the trans community is the violence that we suffer from cis men\".",
      "Nadia Whittome pointed out that a ban on trans women using women's toilets, or trans men using men's toilets, would leave them using facilities they \"would not feel comfortable or safe in\".",
      "Liberal Democrat women and equalities spokeswoman Christine Jardine warned the ruling threatened the human rights and security \"of another vulnerable group in society\" and questioned where trans people should now seek refuge.",
      "Women and Equalities select committee chair, Labour's Sarah Owen, said the judges made their decision \"without a single contribution from trans people\" and won a commitment from Phillipson that trans \"stakeholders\" would be involved in the creation of upcoming guidance.",
      "Some MPs who have campaigned in support of trans rights pointed to commitments in Labour's general election manifesto to introduce a \"trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices\" as well as to \"modernise, simplify, and reform\" gender recognition law.",
      "Those are still Labour Party policies, as far as we are aware, but any sign of backsliding on that and this debate may again become a tense one within Labour's ranks.",
      "Correction: This article originally said that the ruling means that transgender women with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) can be excluded from single-sex spaces if \"proportionate\". However this is inaccurate and so this line has been removed from the story.",

      "It confirmed it is investigating the graffiti as criminal damage and has asked anyone  with information, footage or pictures to come forward.",
      "The Greater London Authority plans to remove the graffiti but this requires specialist equipment and \"we are confident this will be done shortly,\" the Met added.",

      "But the National Fire Chiefs Council says that even with the extra money fire services will be \u00a320m short of the \u00a340m needed to cover national insurance increases.",
      "The BBC contacted all 43 fire authority in England to ask how much the NICs increase is set to cost and cross-referenced that with the size of the grant they are getting to compensate for it.",
      "The data obtained shows the average shortfall to be 50%.",
      "It covers three quarters of the fire services in England and Wales, because 10 fire authorities do not separate out grant money from the money given to the whole county council.",
      "But the Home Office's own estimate is that the cost of the Nics rise to all fire authorities is \u00a340m, which also lends weight to the fire chiefs' claims of a 50% shortfall.",
      "NFCC chair Phil Garrigan said: \"Bridging this gap in funding and making sure there is sustained investment in fire and rescue will be crucial for ensuring we can continue to keep communities safe.",
      "\"What we would have reasonably expected to see is fire treated in the same way as our colleagues in the police, with the whole shortfall covered.\"",
      "Biggest shortfall",
      "Fire Brigades Union general secretary Steve Wright said fire services had already had more than a decade of cuts and the Nics shortfall was coming on top of \" yet another below inflation funding settlement\".",
      "\"If national insurance contributions are not covered fully by central funds, this will further eat into fire service budgets,\" he said.",
      "\"When compared to the police, the cost of covering the rise in national insurance contributions for the fire service is very small, so we urge the government to do the right thing and to avoid another de-facto cut.\"",
      "Funding for fire services is complex because there are several different types of fire authority split into two funding models - but nearly three-quarters of fire authorities have received direct grants from the government, worth \u00a311.9m overall.",
      "Those direct grants were provided to 31 fire authorities - five authorities run by metro mayors and 26 combined fire authorities (CFAs), five of which have Police, Fire and Crime Commissioners (PFCCs).",
      "The biggest shortfall was 67% in West Yorkshire, followed by 60% in Humberside, and the smallest was 17% in Essex, followed by 32% in Cumbria.",
      "There are 10 more fire authorities where a county council runs the fire service, and Nics grants for the fire service were mixed in with the Nics top-ups for council staff, making the total for just the fire service difficult to untangle.",
      "London and Greater Manchester also have their own structures, where the mayor has overall responsibility for Fire and Rescue services, and funding is again not separated out from Nics grants for council staff.",
      "Budget papers from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Services confirmed estimates suggested they could see a 50% shortfall in funding, which \"would equate to the cost of one fully-staffed fire engine\".",
      "A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said the mayor of London had provided an additional \u00a32.5m top-up funding to cover the \u00a34.4m (36%) shortfall left by the government grant.",

      "The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\"",
      "The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.",
      "Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.",
      "Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\".",
      "Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\".",
      "His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.",
      "Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\"",
      "The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said.",
      "Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.",
      "The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.",
      "David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\""

    "summary": "The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut.",
    "story": [
      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",
      "\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.",
      "\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"",
      "Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.",
      "We tasted the steaming dumplings together.",
      "My view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"",
      "Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.",
      "\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"",
      "Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.",
      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",
      "\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.",
      "\"So, astronauts might be more open to having something that has been cooked from scratch and a feeling that you are really eating wholesome food.\"",

      "The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.",
      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",
      "As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.",
      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.",
      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",
      "\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.",

      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",

      "A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.",
      "In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.",

      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",
      "\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.",

      "\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.",
      "But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.",

      "Then, Asif shows me the money shot. It's a snow leopard, recorded a few nights prior, in night-vision. He pulls up another one from the week before. It's a snow leopard raising its tail against a nearby rock. \"It's a mother leopard, looks like she's marking her territory,\" Asif says.",
      "Setting up the cameras in rocky, high-altitude areas took a lot of trial and error. The WWF went through several types of batteries until it found one that could withstand the harsh winters. A specific paint was chosen to avoid reflecting light as animals pass by.",
      "If the cellular service fails in the mountains, the device continues recording and capturing data locally. But the team has had to accept there are some problems they simply cannot solve.",
      "While the camera lens is protected by a metallic box, they've had to replace solar panels damaged by landslides.",
      "Doubt in the community",
      "It is not just the technology that has caused problems. Getting the local community's buy-in has also been a challenge. At first, some were suspicious and doubted whether the project could help them or the snow leopards.",
      "\"We noticed some of the wires had been cut,\" Asif says. \"People had thrown blankets over the cameras.\"",
      "The team also had to be mindful of the local culture and the emphasis on women's privacy. Cameras had to be moved because women were walking by too often.",
      "Some villages still have yet to sign consent and privacy forms, which means the technology cannot be rolled out in their area just yet. The WWF wants a binding promise that local farmers will not give poachers access to the footage.",
      "Sitara lost all six of her sheep in January. She says she had taken them to graze on land above her home but that a snow leopard attacked them.",
      "\"It was three to four years of hard work raising those animals, and it all ended in one day,\" she says.",
      "The loss of her livelihood left her bedridden for several days. When asked if she is hopeful the AI cameras could help in the future, she replies: \"My phone barely gets any service during the day, how can a text help?\"",
      "At a gathering of village elders, leaders of the Khyber village explain how attitudes have changed over the years, and that a growing proportion of their village understands the importance of snow leopards and their impact on the ecosystem.",
      "According to the WWF, snow leopards hunt ibex and blue sheep, which stops these animals from overgrazing and helps to preserve grasslands so villagers can feed their livestock.",
      "But not all are convinced. One local farmer questions the benefits of the animals.",
      "\"We used to have 40 to 50 sheep, now we've only got four or five, and the reason is the threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass,\" he says.",
      "Climate change also has a part to play in why some feel threatened by snow leopards. Scientists say warming temperatures have led villagers to move their crops and livestock to higher areas in the mountains, encroaching on snow leopards' own habitat, making livestock more of a target.",
      "Whether the villagers are convinced by the conservation message or not, the WWF tells us legal penalties have served as a strong deterrent in recent years. Three men were jailed in 2020 after killing a snow leopard in Hoper valley, about a two-hour drive from Khyber. One of them had posted photos of himself with the dead animal on social media.",
      "While those involved in the camera project are hopeful their AI devices can have an impact, they know they cannot be the sole solution.",
      "In September, they are going to start trialling smells, sounds and lights at the camera sites to try to deter snow leopards from moving onto nearby villages, putting themselves and livestock in jeopardy.",

    "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",
      "Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",
      "The Seacure project has \u00a33m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.",
      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",
      "'Some impact on environment'",
      "There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.",
      "Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.",
      "\"Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,\" he says. \"So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.\"",
      "Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.",
      "\"It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that \u2013 for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on.\"",

      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",

      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",

      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",

      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",

    "story": [
      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",

    "summary": "While Meta says the AI chatbot is a \"good thing\", some users have shared their frustrations.",
    "story": [
      "WhatsApp says its new AI feature embedded in the messaging service is \"entirely optional\" - despite the fact it cannot be removed from the app.",
      "The Meta AI logo is an ever-present blue circle with pink and green splashes in the bottom right of your Chats screen.",
      "Interacting with it opens a chatbot designed to answer your questions, but it has drawn attention and frustration from users who cannot remove it from the app.",
      "It follows Microsoft's Recall feature, which was an always-on tool - before the firm faced a backlash and decided to allow people to disable it.",
      "\"We think giving people these options is a good thing and we're always listening to feedback from our users,\" WhatsApp told the BBC.",
      "The company likens the feature to other permanent options in the app like 'channels' and 'status'.",
      "It comes the same week Meta announced an update to its teen accounts feature on Instagram.",
      "The firm revealed it was testing AI technology in the US designed to find accounts belonging to teenagers who have lied about their age on the platform.",
      "Where is the new blue circle?",
      "If you can't see it, you may not be able to use it yet.",
      "Meta says the feature is only being rolled out to some countries at the moment and advises it \"might not be available to you yet, even if other users in your country have access\".",
      "As well as the blue circle, there is a search bar at the top inviting users to 'Ask Meta AI or Search'.",
      "This is also a feature on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with both platforms owned by Meta.",
      "Its AI chatbot is powered by Llama 4, one of the large language models operated by Meta.",
      "Before you ask it anything, there is a long message from Meta explaining what Meta AI is - stating it is \"optional\".",
      "On its website, WhatsApp says Meta AI \"can answer your questions, teach you something, or help come up with new ideas\".",
      "I tried out the feature by asking the AI what the weather was like in Glasgow, and it responded in seconds with a detailed report on temperature, the chance of rain, wind and humidity.",
      "It also gave me two links for further information, but this is where it ran into problems.",
      "One of the links was relevant, but the other tried to give me additional weather details for Charing Cross - not the location in Glasgow, but the railway station in London.",
      "What do people think of it?",
      "So far in Europe people aren't very pleased, with users on X, Bluesky, and Reddit outlining their frustrations - and Guardian columnist Polly Hudson was among those venting their anger at not being able to turn it off.",
      "Dr Kris Shrishak, an adviser on AI and privacy, was also highly critical, and accused Meta of \"exploiting its existing market\" and \"using people as test subjects for AI\".",
      "\"No one should be forced to use AI,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Its AI models are a privacy violation by design - Meta, through web scraping, has used personal data of people and pirated books in training them.",
      "\"Now that the legality of their approach has been challenged in courts, Meta is looking for other sources to collect data from people, and this feature could be one such source.\"",
      "An investigation by The Atlantic revealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its Llama AI.",
      "Author groups across the UK and around the world are organising campaigns to encourage governments to intervene, and Meta is currently defending a court case brought by multiple authors over the use of their work.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment on The Atlantic investigation.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "When you first use Meta AI in WhatsApp, it states the chatbot \"can only read messages people share with it\".",
      "\"Meta can't read any other messages in your personal chats, as your personal messages remain end to end encrypted,\" it says.",
      "Meanwhile the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC it would \"continue to monitor the adoption of Meta AI's technology and use of personal data within WhatsApp\".",
      "\"Personal information fuels much of AI innovation so people need to trust that organisations are using their information responsibly,\" it said.",
      "\"Organisations who want to use people's personal details to train or use generative AI models need to comply with all their data protection obligations, and take the necessary extra steps when it comes to processing the data of children.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Dr Shrishak says users should be wary.",
      "\"When you send messages to your friend, end to end encryption will not be affected,\" he said.",
      "\"Every time you use this feature and communicate with Meta AI, you need to remember that one of the ends is Meta, not your friend.\"",
      "The tech giant also highlights that you should only share material which you know could be used by others.",
      "\"Don't share information, including sensitive topics, about others or yourself that you don't want the AI to retain and use,\" it says.",

    "summary": "The tech giants have reacted with fury, accusing the EU of unfairly pursuing US companies.",
    "story": [
      "The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined \u20ac700m (\u00a3599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.",
      "It has issued a \u20ac500m (\u00a3428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.",
      "\"We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,\" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.",
      "The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of \"attempting to handicap successful American businesses\" and Apple saying it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free.\"",
      "The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.",
      "The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of \"taking advantage\" of America.",
      "EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were \"completely separate\", telling the BBC: \"This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.\"",
      "The White House has been contacted for comment.",
      "Data and apps",
      "The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).",
      "The case against Apple was over its App Store.",
      "The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.",
      "Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.",
      "Meta introduced a \"consent or pay\" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.",
      "The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.",
      "In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says \"allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.\"",
      "The Commission is currently assessing the new option.",
      "In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account \"the gravity and duration of the non-compliance\".",
      "Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.",
      "\"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.",
      "\"As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\"",
      "Apple said the Commission had made \"a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.\"",
      "It also accused the Commission of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings.",
      "Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.",
      "\"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Epic dispute",
      "The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's \u20ac2.4bn fine from last September.",
      "But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.",
      "In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.",
      "\"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.",
      "Prof Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power.",
      "They are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added.",
      "One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.",
      "They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.",
      "Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was \"great news for app developers worldwide\" in a thread on X.",
      "He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.",
      "A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.",
      "The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission \"has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.\"",
      "\"The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,\" it said.",
      "The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.",
      "\"Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems and Google's general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,\" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",

      "Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.",

      "But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.",

      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "The feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.",

      "\"People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,\" he said.",
      "Eli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as \"carefree and fun\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,\" he said. \"Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.\"",
      "And illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.",
      "\"I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,\" she said.",
      "\"With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.\"",
      "Pot Noodles in the Large Hadron Collider",
      "Back in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.",
      "\"I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,\" he said.",
      "\"I think all of us have experimented with it.\"",
      "And Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs.",
      "\"It's like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the 'to-do' list,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedy6gl99eno",
    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:42:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Led by Jensen Huang, dubbed the 'Taylor Swift of tech', the chip giant has become pivotal in the race for AI supremacy.",
    "story": [
      "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.",
      "The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".",
      "But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?",
      "What is Nvidia?",
      "Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.",
      "In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.",
      "Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.",
      "Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.",
      "Why is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?",
      "US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.",
      "In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.",
      "A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.",
      "However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.",
      "DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.",
      "Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.",
      "Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.",
      "Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.",
      "Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.",
      "\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.",
      "Why is Nvidia's CEO in China?",
      "China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.",
      "The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.",
      "In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.",
      "Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.",
      "During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.",
      "How will the export controls impact US-China competition?",
      "The controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.",
      "Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.",
      "And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.",
      "Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.",

    "summary": "India will respond but it's not clear how - or at what cost, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Tuesday's bloodshed in Pahalgam - where at least 26 tourists were killed in a hail of gunfire - marks the deadliest militant attack in Kashmir since 2019.",
      "The victims weren't soldiers or officials, but civilians on holiday in one of India's most picturesque valleys. That alone makes this strike both brutal and symbolic: a calculated assault not just on lives, but on a fragile sense of normalcy the Indian state has worked hard to project in the disputed region.",
      "Given the fraught history of Kashmir - claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but ruled by each only in part - India's response is likely to be shaped as much by precedent as by pressure, say experts.",
      "For starters, Delhi has swiftly taken a series of retaliatory steps: closing the main border crossing, suspending a critical water-sharing treaty, and expelling diplomats.",
      "More significantly, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has vowed a \"strong response,\" pledging action not just against the perpetrators but also the masterminds behind the \"nefarious acts\" on Indian soil.",
      "The question, analysts say, is not whether there will be a military response - but when, and how calibrated it will be, and at what cost.",
      "\"We are likely to see a strong response \u2013 one that signals resolve to both domestic audiences and actors in Pakistan. Since 2016 and especially after 2019, the threshold for retaliation has been set at cross-border or air strikes,\" military historian Srinath Raghavan told the BBC.",
      "\"It'll be hard for the government to act below that now. Pakistan will likely respond, as it did before. The risk, as always, is miscalculation \u2013 on both sides.\"",
      "Mr Raghavan is alluding to two previous major retaliations by India in 2016 and 2019.",
      "After the deadly Uri attack in September 2016, where 19 Indian soldiers were killed, India launched what it called \"surgical strikes\" across the de facto border - also known as the Line of Control (LoC) - targeting what it said were militant launch pads in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.",
      "And in 2019, after at least 40 paramilitary personnel were killed in Pulwama, India hit an alleged militant camp in Balakot with airstrikes - its first such strike deep inside Pakistan since 1971. Pakistan responded with air raids, leading to a dogfight and the brief capture of an Indian pilot. Both sides showed strength but avoided full-scale war.",
      "Two years later, in 2021, they agreed to an LoC ceasefire, which has largely held - despite recurring militant attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, believes that the combination of high fatality levels and the targeting of Indian civilians in the latest attack \"suggests a strong possibility of an Indian military response against Pakistan, if Delhi determines or merely assumes any level of Pakistani complicity\".",
      "\"The chief advantage  of such a reaction for India would be political, as there will be strong public pressure for India to respond forcefully, \" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Another advantage, if a retaliation successfully takes out terrorist targets, would be restoring deterrence and degrading an anti-India threat. The disadvantage is that a retaliation would risk a serious crisis and even conflict.\"",
      "What are India's options?",
      "Covert action offers deniability but may not satisfy the political need to visibly restore deterrence, says Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US.",
      "That leaves India with two possible paths, he notes.",
      "First, the 2021 LoC ceasefire has been fraying, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could greenlight a return to cross-border firing.",
      "Second, airstrikes or even conventional cruise missile strikes, like in 2019, are also on the table - each carrying the risk of a retaliatory spiral, as seen in the air skirmishes that followed then.",
      "\"No path is without risks. The US is also distracted and may not be willing or be able to assist with crisis management,\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia,  told the BBC.",
      "One of the gravest risks in any India-Pakistan crisis is that both sides are nuclear-armed. That fact casts a long shadow over every decision, shaping not just military strategy but political calculations.",
      "\"Nuclear weapons are both a danger and a restraint - they force decision-makers on both sides to act with caution. Any response is likely to be presented as precise and targeted. Pakistan may retaliate in kind, then look for an off-ramp, says Mr Raghavan.",
      "\"We've seen this pattern in other conflicts too, like Israel-Iran - calibrated strikes, followed by efforts to de-escalate. But the risk is always that things won't go according to script.\"",
      "Mr Kugelman says that one of the lessons of the Pulwama crisis is that \"each country is comfortable using limited counter retaliation\".",
      "\"India will need to weigh the political and tactical advantages of retaliation with the risk of a serious crisis or conflict.\"",
      "Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the US, believes escalation is possible this time, with India likely to consider limited \"surgical strikes\" like in 2016.",
      "\"The advantage of such strikes from India's point of view is they are limited in scope, so Pakistan does not have to respond, and yet they demonstrate to the Indian public that India has acted,\" Mr Haqqani, a senior fellow at Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy and Hudson Institute, told the BBC.",
      "\"But such strikes can also invite retaliation from Pakistan, which argues that it is being blamed in a knee jerk reaction, without any investigation or evidence.\"",
      "Whatever course India chooses - and however Pakistan responds -  each step is fraught with risk. The threat of escalation looms, and with it, the fragile peace in Kashmir slips further out of reach.",
      "At the same time, India must reckon with the security failures that allowed the attack to happen in the first place. \"That such an attack occurred at the peak of tourist season,\" Mr Raghavan noted, \"points to a serious lapse - especially in a Union Territory where the federal government directly controls law and order.\""

      "The retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them.",

      "Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.",
      "He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.",

      "The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.",
      "Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".",

      "Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.",

      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".",

      "Abbas, 89, is seen as an irrelevance by many Palestinians.",

      "There is no reference, either, to Russia's demands for Ukraine to be \"demilitarised\", in other words for its army to be reduced massively in size, again another long-term Moscow demand.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine may not be allowed to join Nato but it could join the European Union.",
      "There is no apparent objection to a European \"reassurance force\" deploying to western Ukraine after any ceasefire to deter future Russian aggression.",
      "But it is still not clear if the US is willing to provide a \"backstop\" to this force. There is also uncertainty about what economic sanctions against Russia would be lifted and when, and under what circumstances.",
      "In other words, a huge amount of detail is unclear and still to be discussed.",
      "And all sides seem far apart.",
      "Ukraine still wants an immediate conditional ceasefire and then talks. The US wants a quick win. And Russia wants to get deep into the detail of a peace deal, the like of which normally takes months if not years to resolve.",
      "There is an old Russian saying that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\". Right now we seem far away from that."

    "story": [
      "US Senior Advisor for Africa Massad Boulos has said that President Donald Trump values Africa, despite announcing sweeping aid cuts that have caused considerable humanitarian distress across the continent.",
      "Trump announced the aid freeze on his first day in office in January in line with his \"America First\" foreign policy, while Trump's recent tariffs have raised fears of the end of a trade deal between the US and Africa meant to boost economic growth.",
      "But Mr Boulos told BBC's Newsday that Africa was \"very important\" to Trump and downplayed reports that the US was planning to close some of its missions in the continent.",
      "\"He highly values Africa and African people,\" Mr Boulos added.",
      "The aid cuts have affected health programmes across Africa, including shipments of critical medical supplies, including HIV drugs.",

      "Eight countries - six of them in Africa, including Nigeria, Kenya and Lesotho - could soon run out of HIV drugs following the US decision to pause foreign aid, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.",
      "There are fears that nearly six million more Africans could be pushed into extreme poverty next year following the aid cuts, according to the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) \u2013 a pan-African think-tank.",
      "Earlier this month, eight people, including five children, died after walking for hours to seek treatment for cholera in South Sudan after aid cuts by the Trump administration forced local health clinics to close, the international charity Save the Children reported.",
      "But Mr Boulos said those reported deaths could not be directly linked to the US aid cuts and said they were needed to ensure the money was being well used.",
      "\"It is absolutely necessary [for the US] to review some of these programmes for much more efficiency and transparency,\" Mr Boulos said.",
      "\"We have to make sure the [aid funds] are going to the right place and that we are getting the desired outcome,\" he added.",
      "Mr Boulos, whose son is married to Trump's daughter, Tiffany, said several US companies had expressed an interest in exploiting minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, following his recent trip to the resource-rich central African nation.",
      "DR Congo, home to vast natural reserves like lithium which is essential for battery and electric vehicle production, has been battling Rwandan-backed M23 rebels, who have seized large areas of territory this year.",
      "Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi believes US involvement in extracting the minerals could help quell the violence that has plagued the east of the country for nearly 30 years. Currently, DR Congo's mineral wealth is dominated by Chinese firms.",
      "Mr Boulos said his country was also interested in exploring minerals in neighbouring Rwanda, but called on the country to first withdraw its troops from DR Congo and stop its support for the M23. Rwanda denies involvement in the conflict.",
      "Asked if the US was only interested in benefiting economically from Africa and not its welfare, Boulos said \"our job is to promote the US interests and promote our strategic partnerships\".",
      "Trump is also determined \"to end wars and establish peace\" across the world, the envoy said, citing the conflict in Sudan as a big concern for the US government.",
      "Mr Boulos, who has served as Washington's senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs since December, also visited Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda in his trip.",
      "He has business interests in Africa, including in a Nigeria-based company that distributes motor vehicles and equipment in West Africa.",
      "The Lebanese-born businessman said Trump felt it was time to end the \"unfair advantage\" taken by other international players of Africa.",
      "Responding to reports in the US media that the Trump administration was planning to close most of its diplomatic missions in Africa, Mr Boulos said this was \"not very accurate\", adding: \"Africa is very important to Trump.\"",
      "On the trade tariffs announced by Trump, Mr Boulos said they had \"zero net-effect\" for most African countries as they touched on \"small trade volumes\" from the continent.",
      "\"Many countries have lined up for negotiations and at the end of the day we want fairness and a win-win solution,\" he added.",

      "There is an opportunity for a \"big deal\" between the US and China on trade, America's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said.",
      "Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an \"incredible opportunity\" to strike an agreement, if China was \"serious\" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.",
      "\"China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,\" he said.",
      "The comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.",
      "US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.",
      "These include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.",
      "Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a \"matter of impetus and will\".",
      "\"There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.",
      "\"If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy\u2026 if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.\"",
      "The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that he expected a de-escalation of the trade war and that the current situation was \"not a joke\".",
      "Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.",
      "Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.",
      "Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as \"climate change, gender and social issue\".",
      "\"These issues are not the IMF's mission,\" he said.",
      "Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.",
      "Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was \"very frankly encouraged\" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.",
      "Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are \"falling short\" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.",
      "He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and \"push them to accomplish their important mandates\"."

    "summary": "This is the first time in Ghana's history that a president has removed a chief justice from office.",
    "story": [
      "Opposition MPs in Ghana have fiercely condemned the suspension of the country's chief justice, accusing President John Mahama of trying to \"pack the courts\" with justices who are sympathetic to the governing party, the NDC.",
      "Gertrude Torkornoo was removed from her post on Wednesday - the first time a chief justice has been suspended in the country's history.",
      "The action was taken after three petitions, which made allegations against Ms Torkornoo, were filed.",
      "The content of the petitions has not been made public and Ms Torkornoo is yet to comment openly on the matter.",
      "Mahama's supporters have backed the move as a long overdue move to clean up the judiciary.",
      "But it was condemned by the opposition as \"nothing short of a brazen judicial coup, a reckless abuse of executive power, and a direct assault on the independence of Ghana's judiciary\", the MPs said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said the chief justice was asked to step aside so that the allegations against her could be investigated.",
      "Since the suspension was announced, two more petitions have been filed against Ms Torkornoo.",
      "Former attorney general Godfred Yeboah Dame told the BBC he thought the suspension was a \"complete charade... the biggest assault on the [judiciary] in the nation's history\".",
      "Before Ms Torkornoo was suspended, lawyers filed at least two lawsuits challenging the legality of the procedure being used by the president.",
      "By law the president should have given copies of the petition to the chief justice before suspending her, which he initially failed to do. However, he did later make them available to her.",
      "The caucus of opposition MPs says that by suspending the chief justice before the Supreme Court had ruled on these lawsuits, Mahama had \"violated\" due process.",
      "But some Ghanaians support the president's move.",
      "Dr Tony Aidoo, Ghana's former ambassador to the Netherlands, told radio station Joy News: \"I think the president is protecting the judiciary in Ghana from the actions of a person who does not behave in a manner that should keep her there... if there's a stench in the room you have to let in fresh air.\"",
      "Some accuse the Supreme Court under Ms Torkornoo of siding with former President Nana Akufo-Addo and his party on several high-profile political cases.",
      "For example, last year, the justices ruled that the speaker's decision to declare four MP's seats vacant was unconstitutional.",
      "Ghana has had 15 chief justices, whose job involves overseeing the administration of justice in the country.",
      "Those that came before Ms Torkornoo ended their term by retiring - none have been suspended or permanently removed.",
      "Chief justices can only be removed from office on a few grounds, such as incompetence or misbehaviour.",
      "Ms Torkornoo is Ghana's third female chief justice and was nominated in 2023 by Akufo-Addo.",
      "According to Reuters news agency, Ms Torkornoo survived a removal request earlier this year when Akufo-Addo said a petition to have her dismissed had \"several deficiencies\".",
      "A five-member committee has now been set up to investigate the current allegations against Ms Torkornoo.",

      "The plan's publication comes amid heightened fears over Russia's military ambitions in the region, in light of the ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

    "summary": "Three thousand names were removed from an official list of those killed in Israel's offensive.",
    "story": [
      "At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Alam Hirzallah resigns himself to a grim task: registering the deaths of the wife and two children of his grieving cousin.",
      "His family brought the bodies here on an electric rickshaw or tuk-tuk. They found them in their house in eastern Gaza City after Israeli shelling hit the family home. Asma Hirzallah, Mayar, 5, and Abdullah, 3, were killed.",
      "\"The hospital asked for their full names and ID numbers,\" explains Alam, referring to the numbers all Palestinians are given in a population registry administered by Israel.",
      "\"They gave us a paper to confirm they were martyred and told us to come back for the death certificate. Now we don't know where to go to bury them as the cemeteries are in areas under Israeli control.\"",
      "At least 51,266 people have been killed in the 18 months since the Gaza war began, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, with nearly a third of the dead aged under 18.",
      "Israel has repeatedly challenged the accuracy of the Palestinian fatalities list - in terms of overall numbers, and in particular, the demographic breakdown - claiming it is used as Hamas propaganda. The figures are cited with attribution, by UN agencies and widely in the media.",
      "The list does not distinguish between civilians and members of Palestinian armed groups who are killed in the war, and Israel has accused Hamas of inflating the percentages of women and children.",
      "Recently, several media reports have raised questions about the reliability of the statistics by highlighting anomalies between the August and October 2024 and March 2025 lists of fatalities.  The reports focus on how some 3,000 names of people originally identified as fatalities were removed from later revised lists.",
      "A Gazan health official, Zaher al-Wahidi, denied to the BBC that victims had vanished or that there was a lack of transparency, insisting: \"The health ministry works towards having accurate data with high credibility.",
      "\"In every list that gets shared, there is a greater verification and revision of the list.  We cannot say that the health ministry removes names.  It's not a removal process, rather it is a revision and verification process.\"",
      "Verifying data",
      "So how are the statistics gathered and how accurate are they?",
      "Until the first months of this war, the number of people killed in Gaza was calculated from counting bodies that arrived in hospitals - like those of Asma Hirzallah and her children.",
      "Medics could log data for all deaths into a centralised computer system, which was based at a Ministry of Health office at al-Shifa hospital, with a back-up at al-Rantissi hospital.",
      "However, as conditions became more chaotic and medical sites repeatedly came under attack, this method became less reliable. During the war, Israel says it has targeted hospitals \u2013 which have protected status under international law \u2013 because Hamas has used them to hide its fighters and infrastructure \u2013 something the armed group denies.",
      "From the start of 2024, Gazan health officials introduced online forms which relatives could use to report their loved ones dead or missing.",
      "According to Mr Wahidi, the head of statistics at the health ministry, most of the names which were recently removed from the official list as part of a new checking process had originally been submitted using these forms.  He says that names which are taken off may later be added back",
      "\"A judicial committee was set up and it looks into all of the cases received,\" Mr Wahidi says. \"To ensure credibility we verify the data so that it will be accurate.\"",
      "During investigations by the judicial committee, some people were found to have died of natural causes \u2013 not directly because of the war.  When Gazans die from lack of medical treatment, malnutrition or hypothermia, Mr Wahidi clarifies \"these cases are indirect and do not get added to the lists.\"",
      "Other individuals were wrongly listed as dead but then found to have been among thousands of Gazans imprisoned by Israel.",
      "Mr Wahidi confirms that in August and then October, a total of more than 3,000 names were removed from the list, saying this was a precautionary measure pending full checks.",
      "For some pro-Israel groups, such as media watchdog HonestReporting, this was strong indication of \"deliberate manipulation, not honest error\".",
      "There had been a widespread presumption that only checked names were included on the online lists published.",
      "\"It seems like they're actually updating the lists more in real time, as more information appears,\" says Professor Mike Spagat of Royal Holloway College, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation. \"We should have regarded the previous lists as a little bit more provisional than I had assumed.\"",
      "However, he says he detects no attempt by health officials to mislead and sees the changes as \"a big clean-up operation\".",
      "He points out that the latest modifications to the list led to a small increase in the percentage of adult males among those killed, countering the idea that the original inclusion of the 3,000-plus names was done in an attempt to exaggerate the proportion of women and children.",
      "Bodies under rubble",
      "The Gaza health ministry says it has also recently audited data in its official fatalities list from hospital mortuaries for errors and omissions.",
      "When deaths were registered by friends or neighbours, it says, they often did not know the ID numbers of those killed or their full names - which include the father and grandfather's names. In some cases, this resulted in the wrong people being marked as dead.",
      "Thousands of bodies that are still under the rubble left by Israeli air strikes, as well as about 900 which are unidentified, are not currently included in the health ministry list, the ministry says.",
      "However, the recent two-month ceasefire - which allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans to return to what was left of their homes - saw nearly 800 corpses being retrieved, identified and registered.",
      "In late January, the BBC filmed workers from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency as they set about retrieving human remains which had been left for months in Wadi Gaza - also known as the Netzarim Corridor \u2013 after a pullout by Israeli forces.",
      "With no DNA testing available in Gaza, each corpse was given a serial number. Long forms were filled in to log the bones and clothing collected to try to identify the dead.",
      "\"We look for distinctive personal belongings: a watch, a necklace or an earring. When we search the bodies, it's very possible that we'll find a driver's licence or ID card,\" said Sameh Khalifa, who led the team.",
      "\"Even a broken tooth can be a distinguishing mark that will help a family recognise a missing loved one.\"",
      "Combatant death tolls",
      "Since the resumption of Israel's military offensive in Gaza on 18 March, the numbers killed have risen daily.",
      "Israel periodically estimates the number of Palestinian fighters killed. At the start of this year, it assessed that 20,000 members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were among the dead. In mid-April it said there had been \"more than 100 targeted eliminations\" in the past month.",
      "Israel does not provide its figures for civilian deaths in Gaza and has not officially challenged any of the names on the local health ministry casualty list.",
      "The war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas led a cross-border attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 people into captivity in Gaza. Since then, the Israeli military says that 408 of its soldiers have been killed in combat.",
      "International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.",
      "We rely heavily on local Palestinian journalists working with us to access information about deadly attacks - interviewing witnesses as well as visiting bomb sites and hospital mortuaries to film footage, which is shared with us.",
      "Overall, the numbers killed in the past year and a half dwarf those from previous rounds of fighting in the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict and yet, for the moment, there is no end in sight to the war.",
      "Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?",

    "summary": "The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",
    "story": [
      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

      "A series of earthquakes including a 6.2-magnitude tremor have struck near Istanbul, shaking buildings and prompting people to flee their homes.",
      "At least 151 were injured jumping from high places, the governor of Turkey's largest city said on X. There were no deaths and no major structural damage reported, authorities said.",
      "The largest earthquake on Wednesday struck at 12:49 local time (09:49 GMT) at a depth of 6.92 km (4.3 miles), Turkey's emergency services said.",
      "Large groups of people remained on the streets as aftershocks struck in the afternoon, and many have prepared to spend the night outside to safeguard against another strong tremor.",
      "The epicentre of the 6.2-magnitude tremor was located along the coast of the Sea of Marmara, in the Silivri area about 80 km (50 miles) west of Istanbul. City authorities said more than 50 aftershocks had been recorded in the hours since.",
      "Residents reported the main earthquake as one of the strongest they had felt in years, with many saying they feared an even bigger quake.",
      "Many gathered to spend the evening outdoors in the main square in Besiktas, a large student area and one of the city's busiest.",
      "Selim Ustaoglu, a student, told the BBC he grabbed a few essentials as he fled his accommodation, and would not be returning for at least the night.",
      "He packed a small bag with a charger, toothbrush and his favourite sweater before heading to the square. \"I'm staying here tonight,\" he said.",
      "Zeynep Akincioglu, another student, said he didn't feel he could take his family home under the threat of more shocks. \"I don't feel safe going back inside, our building doesn't look strong,\" he said.",
      "Selva Demiralp, an economics professor at Koc University, told the BBC she was with her family in a high-rise when the earthquake struck and it was \"quite scary\".",
      "\"We are safe, it looks there was no damage in buildings,\" she said. But she added that people were nervous about whether the quake \"was a foreshock itself\" and the \"real one is on its way\".",
      "There has been little visible structural damage to the city, however. Authorities said an abandoned building in the Fatih district on the European side of the city had collapsed.",
      "Energy and gas supplies, drinking water and sewerage infrastructure were unaffected, it added in a post on X.",
      "Schools were closed on Wednesday due to a public holiday. They will remain so on Thursday and Friday, Education Minister Yusuf Tekin said, though open ground would be available for use as safe spaces.",
      "Southern Turkey was devastated by two giant earthquakes in 2023, which killed more than 55,000 people.",
      "Istanbul is Turkey's most populous city and home to 16 million people - a fifth of the country's residents. The city lies 20km to the north of the North Anatolian Fault Line.",

    "story": [
      "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.",
      "It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.",
      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",
      "For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.",
      "Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?",
      "Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.",

      "IN PICTURES: Symbolism on show as Pope lies in open coffin",
      "EXPLAINER: Key candidates in an unpredictable contest to be the next Pope",
      "PROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession."

    "summary": "From rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.",
    "story": [
      "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.",
      "Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".",
      "Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "China can take the pain (to a point)",
      "China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.",
      "With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.",
      "Beijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change.",
      "And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.",
      "The leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.",
      "China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.",
      "Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.",
      "The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.",
      "The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".",
      "President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"",
      "China has been investing in the future",
      "China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.",
      "Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.",
      "It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.",
      "Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.",
      "Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.",
      "US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.",
      "That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.",
      "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",
      "Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice",
      "Lessons from Trump 1.0",
      "Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.",
      "It has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.",
      "American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.",
      "\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.",
      "The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.",
      "That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.",
      "Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".",
      "That would be an impossible choice for much of the world",
      "\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.",
      "China now knows when Trump will blink",
      "Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".",
      "But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.",
      "Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.",
      "China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.",
      "Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".",
      "But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.",
      "Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.",
      "China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"",
      "A chokehold on rare earths",
      "What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.",
      "China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.",
      "Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.",
      "China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.",
      "In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.",
      "The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously.",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

      "While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another.",
      "When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making?",
      "\"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.",

      "He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.",
      "\"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said.",
      "Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.",
      "For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.",
      "\"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me.",
      "\"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.",
      "\"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\"",
      "The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\".",
      "\"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.",
      "In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.",
      "He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\".",
      "\"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\"",
      "Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa.",
      "For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.",
      "His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.",
      "But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.",
      "Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.",
      "The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\".",
      "It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.",
      "The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.",
      "Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\"",
      "And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\".",
      "Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.",
      "And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.",
      "\"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said.",
      "\"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\"",
      "As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.",
      "It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\".",
      "But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.",
      "\"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.",
      "\"I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\"",

    "story": [
      "Shot 16 times in an assassination attempt in 2017, Tindu Lissu is the great survivor of Tanzanian politics - and one of its most persecuted politicians.",
      "But some are asking whether he has now reached the the end of the line.",
      "Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party, Chadema, is back in the limelight after being charged with treason - a crime for which the maximum sentence is the death penalty.",
      "Still, he is undeterred. Despite the enormous risk, he believes he can pressure the government to institute reforms, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in October.",
      "But can he weather the storm in a harsh political environment, and against what he believes are politically driven charges?",
      "His party has been disqualified from the elections and he has been in detention for the past two weeks.",
      "In September last year, Lissu told the BBC that nothing would come on a silver platter, and it would take courage to demand reforms \"on the streets and in the villages\".",
      "To achieve his goals, he felt he had to take over Chadema's leadership.",
      "A fiery politician, Lissu was critical of the way the party was being run, accusing then chairman Freeman Mbowe of being too reconciliatory towards the government.",
      "In an intense race, he ousted Mbowe from the post.",
      "After just three months at the helm of Chadema, Lissu was this month arrested and detained for a speech allegedly calling for the public to launch a rebellion and disrupt the elections.",
      "He was not allowed to enter a plea on the treason charge but pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of publishing false information.",
      "Prior to his arrest, he had been holding gatherings across the country with a rallying call of \"no reforms, no elections\".",
      "He said the current system was rigged in favour of the ruling CCM party, adding that without reforms, there was no point in taking part in the elections.",
      "He is due to reappear in court on Thursday. He cannot seek bail because he has been charged with treason.",
      "His international lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, told the BBC that it was their \"mission to defend democracy\".",
      "Yet it is no simple task - CCM has won every election since independence, and is unlikely to easily let go of its stranglehold on power.",
      "There is also a rift in Chadema, with some members disagreeing with Lissu's strategy.",
      "The party is barred from contesting October's election after it refused to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.",
      "The document's key objective \"is to ensure that political parties and their supporters behave well... and maintain peace and harmony\" during the elections.",
      "Chadema sees the code of conduct as a ploy to contain the opposition, and it fears that state repression will continue.",
      "In September a senior Chadema party official was abducted and brutally killed amid a wave of abductions of government critics.",
      "During local elections in November, Chadema said thousands of its candidates were barred from participating. The ruling party won about 98% of the seats.",
      "The government dismissed suggestions that the elections were not free and fair, saying they were held in accordance with the rules.",
      "But for Lissu, the local elections justified his calls for reforms ahead of the presidential and parliamentary polls.",
      "Tanzania's main opposition party banned from electionWhy Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political anger",
      "Tanzania's main opposition party banned from election",
      "Why Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political anger",
      "Campaign group Human Rights Watch has expressed similar fears, and has urged the government to end political repression.",
      "The Catholic Church has added its voice to calls for the unconditional release of Lissu, and for fair elections.",
      "But the arrest of opposition politicians has continued, despite Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa promising earlier this month that the authorities would ensure security and fairness in the polls.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the government for comment.",
      "President Samia Suluhu Hassan gave Tanzanians greater political freedom after she took office following the death in office of her predecessor John Magufuli in 2021.",
      "However, Tanzania was once again \"beginning to see the wave of repression and state-orchestrated violence\" that characterised Magufuli's rule, Tanzanian political analyst Nicodemus Minde said.",
      "It was during that era that Lissu survived an assassination attempt.",
      "Before his arrest, Lissu said his party had a list of \"minimum but critical reforms that must be made to guarantee free elections\".",
      "Mr Amsterdam, his lawyer, told the BBC that this included the formation of \"a truly independent national electoral commission with members unconnected to the government\" - and this must be enshrined in the constitution.",
      "Chadema is also demanding that when there are electoral disputes, the burden of proof should lie with the commission to show that the vote was free and fair.",
      "Lissu's strategy has come at a heavy cost to himself and Chadema, as a faction within the party, known as G-55,  has adopted a softer stance.",
      "It has called for the party to contest the elections while pursuing talks with the government over its demands.",
      "That is the approach taken by the second largest opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo.",
      "Along with 16 fringe opposition parties, it has signed the code of conduct. Only Chadema has refused.",
      "Lissu appears to see neighbouring Kenya - where mass protests last year forced the government to drop plans to increase taxes - as a model to follow.",
      "At the time, he told the BBC that Tanzanians had not \"pressed hard enough for democratic reform\", and what Kenya went through in order to get [its] democratic dispensation is something that we need to do\".",
      "Whether such a strategy would work is unclear, as many Tanzanians appear reluctant to publicly support a campaign that could rattle the government.",
      "But Mr Amsterdam said the more intransigent the government, the more it would spur Chadema's supporters \"to push forward and engage in civil disobedience\".",
      "He added that Chadema would use \"every legal and political tool\" to achieve change.",
      "But political analyst Thomas Kibwana criticised Lissu's strategy, saying that with the term of the current parliament due to end in June there would not be enough time to give legal effect to any major reforms ahead of the October election.",
      "He said it might be better for Chadema to wait until after the election.",
      "Fulgence Massawe, the director of a legal rights organisation in Tanzania, told the BBC that Chadema's push for electoral reforms faced significant hurdles, but the party had the right to go to court to challenge its exclusion from the elections.",
      "Mr Minde said that if Chadema remained shut out of the elections, the ruling party is likely to increase its already overwhelming majority in parliament.",
      "The analyst added that Chadema might even lose its standing as the main opposition party, and \"of course nature pulls back and probably other opposition parties will seize this opportunity\".",
      "It is a risk that Lissu and the party have chosen to take.",

      "After receiving hormone treatment for an illness, Abby's weight increased from 42kg (6 stone 8lbs) to 62kg (9 stone 11lbs) in two months.",
      "The change hadn't gone unnoticed by her drama teacher.",
      "\"My teacher said, 'You were our star but now you're too fat. Either give up or lose weight fast,'\" recalls Abby, who was preparing for her drama exams at the time.",
      "Abby's mother stepped in, taking her to get liposuction to remove fat from her belly and legs.",
      "Abby remembers her mother's words as she waited in the clinic in a hospital gown, nervous about the impending operation.",
      "\"Just be brave and walk in. You'll become pretty once you're out.\"",
      "The surgery was traumatic. Abby was only given partial anaesthesia and remained conscious throughout.",
      "\"I could see how much fat was extracted from my body and how much blood I was losing,\" she says.",
      "Now 35, Abby has gone on to have more than 100 procedures, costing half a million dollars.",
      "She co-owns a beauty clinic in central Beijing and has become one of the most recognisable faces of China's plastic surgery boom.",
      "But the surgeries have come at a physical cost.",
      "Sitting in front of a mirror inside her luxury duplex apartment in Beijing, she gently dabs concealer onto bruises from a recent face-slimming injection - a procedure she undergoes monthly to help her face appear \"firmer and less chubby\" after three jaw reduction surgeries removed too much bone.",
      "But she insists she has no regrets about the surgeries and believes her mother made the right decision all those years ago.",
      "\"The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.\"",
      "Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media.",
      "Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures.",
      "Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25.",
      "While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing.",
      "For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face.",
      "But lately, more disturbing procedures are on the rise - chasing an unrealistic, hyper-feminine, almost infantile ideal.",
      "Details of help and support with body image concerns are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of help and support with body image concerns are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",
      "Botox is now injected behind the ears to tilt them forward, creating the illusion of a smaller, daintier face.",

      "Upper lip shortening narrows the space between lip and nose, thought to signal youth.",
      "But much of this beauty is built for the screen. Under filters and ring lights, the results can look flawless. In real life, the effect is often uncanny - a face not quite human, not quite child.",
      "Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of \"facial imperfections\" - have been surging in popularity.",
      "After scanning and assessing users' faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation.",
      "These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what's considered desirable and normal.",
      "As one of China's earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched.",
      "Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung's \"magic mirror\" feature, the app still points out \"imperfections\" and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries.",
      "\"It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I've done that.\"",
      "Abby seems amused.",
      "\"Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?\"",
      "Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice.",
      "'My skin felt like there was cement underneath'",
      "To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China.",
      "But there's a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence.",
      "According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications.",
      "As a result, it's estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics.",
      "Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing.",
      "\"I've seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,\" Dr Yang says.",
      "\"Some even had surgery inside people's homes.\"",
      "Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong.",
      "In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened.",
      "\"My skin felt like there was cement underneath,\" she says.",
      "Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse.",
      "One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose.",
      "Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight.",
      "\"My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it's affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too.\"",
      "She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic.",
      "But while Dr Yang's surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent.",
      "\"I don't want to become prettier any more,\" she says.",

      "She had received the nose surgery at a licensed Guangzhou clinic called She's Times from Dr He Ming, who was described as its \"chief surgeon\" and a nose surgery expert.",
      "But in reality Dr He was not fully qualified to perform the surgery without supervision and had not obtained his licensed plastic surgeon status from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission.",
      "Authorities fined the clinic, which closed soon after the scandal, and barred Dr He from practising for six months.",
      "However, weeks before She's Times was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address.",
      "BBC Eye has found strong links between She's Times and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He.",
      "The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021.",
      "Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches.",

      "One receptionist role asks for candidates to be \"at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing\", while an administrative job demands \"an appealing look and an elegant presence\".",
      "And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers.",
      "Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a \"beauty consultant\" job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024.",
      "After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening.",
      "But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job.",
      "Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide.",
      "Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (\u00a31,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest.",

      "The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her.",
      "She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real.",
      "\"They wanted me to leave from the beginning,\" she says.",
      "Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months.",
      "BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China's \"capital of cosmetic surgery\". Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years.",
      "The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role.",
      "This scam isn't limited to clinic jobs - it's creeping into other industries.",
      "Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame.",
      "But behind the scenes, these firms often have undisclosed agreements with clinics - taking a cut from every applicant they send to the operating table.",

      "\"My skin isn't as stretchable after so many procedures. The doctors don't have much to work with. You can't give them enough fabric for a vest and expect a wedding dress.\"",

      "But despite everything, Abby has no plans to stop.",

      "Delhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".",
      "In a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.",
      "The report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\".",
      "You could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked.",
      "Then there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.",
      "Let your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.",
      "Promoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)",
      "Jail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.",
      "More than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds.",
      "Some 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\".",
      "Even the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.",
      "Out of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees.",
      "To be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.",
      "\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.",
      "\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"",
      "This \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says.",
      "Businesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.",
      "The report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.",
      "Rioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment.",
      "The irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.",
      "Even more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.",
      "The sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.",
      "\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"",
      "Over 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages",
      "Even the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.",
      "\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.",
      "It says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.",
      "Authorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen."

      "During 18-months of war, he took to calling them nightly to check on their wellbeing.",
      "\"What did you eat today?\" the Pope asks the local priests in the video, having switched to Italian. \"The rest of the chicken from yesterday,\" replies Father Gabriel Romanelli.",
      "Only a few hundred Christians remain in Gaza among the territory's almost entirely Muslim population of more than 2 million. Many have been living, as well as worshipping, at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza City.",
      "With the Pope's death they feel they have lost a dear friend.",
      "\"He used to call us daily during the war, on the black days under the bombing - on the days when people were killed and injured,\" Father Romanelli said.",
      "\"Sometimes, we didn't have a phone connection for hours and the Pope with all of his responsibilities would try to reach us.\"",
      "George Anton, a local Catholic, is the emergency coordinator in the Holy Family church. He told me that shock left him virtually speechless the first time he spoke to the Pope but that he ended up talking to him regularly on video calls.",
      "He explained to the pontiff how he had lost his home and relatives.",
      "\"He was all the time blessing me and he was totally understanding our situation and he always encouraged us to be strong,\" Mr Anton said.  \"And he asked 'What can I do for you? What more can I do for you'?\"",

      "Pope Francis visited the Holy Land in 2014. A defining image of his trip came at an unscheduled stop off in Bethlehem when he prayed for peace by the graffitied wall that forms part of Israel's West Bank barrier.",
      "On Sunday in his Easter message, his last public appearance, he was again calling for peace and a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "With his words read by an aide, he said: \"The terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.''",
      "\"War is not just weapons.  War is sometimes words,\" the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said when I asked him about the Pope's final address.  He said the Pope had a moral clarity.",
      "\"Pope Francis recently, especially in the last year, has been very outspoken about the situation of the Holy Land, calling for the liberation of the hostages, but also condemning the dramatic situation, the ongoing war in Gaza and the situation for Palestinians,\" the cardinal said.",
      "Israeli media has noted that while President Isaac Herzog expressed condolences to the Catholic world, there were not similar comments from the prime minister or foreign minister as would have been expected - widely attributed to the Pope's strong positions against the Gaza war.",
      "Some of his most explicit criticism of Israel came late last year when excerpts of an upcoming book were published.",
      "\"According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,\" Pope Francis wrote.",
      "\"It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.\"",
      "Israel firmly rejects allegations of genocide in Gaza and says its war goal is to defeat Hamas.",
      "As a conclave gets under way in Rome this week to decide Pope Francis's successor, Palestinians and Israelis will be watching closely to see what the next Pope has to say about their intractable conflict.",
      "Christians in Gaza say they hope that whoever is chosen will be pushing for peace."

      "The fact that Pope Francis never returned to his country after becoming the pontiff left some Argentines with a heavy heart.",
      "Speaking on Monday, Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Ignacio Garc\u00eda Cuerva said his parish were \"orphans of a father who profoundly loved his country and had to learn to become the father of the whole world\".",

      "PROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell",
      "EXPLAINER: How the next pope is chosen",
      "It came as a surprise to many \u2013 including Bergoglio himself \u2013 that he was elected to the highest office in the Catholic Church in the first place.",
      "At 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.",
      "\"When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,\" Guillermo Marc\u00f3, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn.",
      "However, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.",
      "His death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.",
      "Those qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.",
      "The fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.",
      "Gustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.",
      "\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.",
      "During his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.",
      "He was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.",
      "The initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.",
      "Of six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.",
      "Conservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.",
      "Critics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.",
      "Every time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.",
      "\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.",
      "Some fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.",
      "The pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.",
      "Mr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.",
      "\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.",
      "The \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.",
      "There is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"",
      "The comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.",
      "Before taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.",
      "The two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.",
      "Some Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.",
      "But according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".",
      "The late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.",
      "Although he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.",
      "\"Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,\" he added.",
      "It is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.",
      "Argentina was \"always in his prayers\", Ms Castro said. \"In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.\"",
      "But Mr Vera acknowledged that not everyone felt the same way, and suggested it was up to Argentines to look within themselves for answers: \"Rather than blaming Francis, we Argentines should ask ourselves what we were doing that meant we did not deserve the Pope's visit.\"",

      "It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.",
      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",

      "PROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",

      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",

    "story": [
      "Tina Knowles, the mother of global music superstars Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange, is opening up about her personal relationship with her mother, details about her divorces, her own parenting and the girl group Destiny's Child.",
      "Knowles, a businesswoman, fashion designer and former stylist for Destiny's Child, is telling her life story in her memoir, \"Matriarch,\" where she reveals a complicated but loving relationship with her own mother, who she described as \"overprotective\" and \"fearful.\"",
      "At one point, Knowles said she wanted to be a singer herself and was even in a girl group known as The Veltones.",
      "\"I wanted to be a singer, but you know, this little town was about that big and there were no singers there and that's what my mom said. My mom, as, you know, as much as I loved her and she wanted the best for me, she would've done anything for me to be a singer, she really didn't have any hope.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview that that aspect of her upbringing influenced how she parented.",
      "\"I was gonna trust my kids and even though I never believed in being friends, \u2026 but I wanted to be trusted by them,\" she said, adding that she wanted them to know the sky was the limit when it came to achieving their dreams.",
      "\"'Cause my parents put limitations on me. Not because they wanted to, because they didn't want me to be disappointed or hurt,\" she said. \"I told my girls that all the time, you could be whatever you wanna be. You could do whatever you wanna do and I'm gonna be right there to help make it happen.\"",
      "Impact on parenting",
      "Knowles spoke with King about how different her daughters were growing up. She said once a teacher recommended Beyonc\u00e9 repeat a grade in school. Knowles said, now a global superstar, Beyonc\u00e9 was shy and quiet until she got to know people.",
      "\"Never shy around us,\" Knowles said. \"At home, she was entertaining. She was singing, she was dancing and she was doing all the things that I did. \u2026 So she would get quiet until she got to know you.\"",
      "A former teacher told Knowles in her evaluation that Beyonc\u00e9 was a bright student.",
      "\"I took her to Ms. Little. ... Was an ex-teacher there who was very stern, but she said, 'there's nothing wrong with this girl. This girl is very bright. She just doesn't care to let you know it.'\"",
      "Conversely, Knowles described Solange as \"very outgoing\" and would \"walk into the room and be like, 'yes, I'm here.'\"",
      "When Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange were 12 and 7 years old, Knowles put them in therapy together. It was a controversial decision within her own family as her then husband, Mathew Knowles, objected.",
      "\"He was like, 'I don't want any parts of that,'\" Knowles said.",
      "For Knowles it was important as she started to see separation between her two daughters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 had become like this little star in the town and she was always so close to Solange and so kind to her, but then she was in the singing group, so everything took place in our house,\" she said. The other girls in the group would tell Solange to shut up and be quiet and all that and I started noticing that she wasn't protecting her sister.\"",
      "Knowles' goal through therapy was to ensure the two grew up close, telling King, \"whatever I have to do to make that happen.\"",
      "Beginnings of Destiny's Child",
      "Knowles said she tried to be a singer, and although for her it didn't work out, she used her skills to help her daughters achieve their dreams.",
      "\"God has always given me these tools from day one that I could go back and pull out and who would've ever thought that I would wind up making costumes for Destiny's Child? Or that I would be doing hair and all the things I did for our group and even the rehearsals and the discipline of that and the harmonies \u2026 I got to use it with the girls,\" she said.",
      "But Knowles admits there were problems along the way. She said the label didn't like the way she styled Destiny's Child.",
      "\"They dressed like an R&B group. We love the big glamour. And their hair was too big 'cause we came from Texas,\" she said. \"They just thought that it was too much for those young girls and that they should be in jeans and t-shirts like all the pop icons at the time. In the meantime, everywhere we went, people were saying,' Where can we get these outfits?'\"",
      "Knowles said the criticism from the label hurt her feelings, but it was a moment she remembers her husband, Mathew, pushing back.",
      "\"He was just bold and when I talk about him, that's one of the things that he went to bat for me all the time, he fought, he protected me.\"",
      "Navigating marriage and parenting criticisms",
      "Knowles also wrote candidly in her memoir about the highs and lows of her 30-year marriage to Mathew Knowles.",
      "She said from the beginning, there was infidelity in their marriage on his part and she realized she needed to be prepared.",
      "\"I was pregnant and things were \u2014 they just got really bad at that time. I knew that I had to make a move and I didn't want to be dependent on him,\" she said.",
      "She started planning what she called her escape plan. Knowles opened a hair salon called Headliners, which was so successful it became the family's main source of income and helped to fund Beyonc\u00e9's budding musical career. Mathew Knowles left his sales executive role at Xerox and started working as Destiny's Child's manager full-time. Their partnership as parents helped to hold their marriage together.",
      "\"People say to me, 'how did you stay so long?' And I'm like, 'well, I was married for 33 years, but 33 years were not bad.' \u2026 You know, maybe 15 of them were bad, but we would have these long stretches where we would do really great.\"",
      "While their marriage struggled, Knowles said they were always present parents, but subject to scrutiny. She recalled the criticism people would say after Solange became pregnant as a teenager.",
      "\"Crazy stuff like, 'well you wasn't paying no attention. You're so busy running behind B that you couldn't see' \u2014 blah, blah, blah. I'm like, 'that is absolutely not true.'\"",
      "Knowles went on to say, people didn't understand Solange's history.",
      "\"They didn't know the backstory of Solange losing her best friend and wanting to hurry up and be a grownup 'cause she thought she wouldn't live so long.\"",
      "Knowles said Solange made it clear she was getting married.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, well let me at least give you a wedding,' you know, and made it memorable for her,\u00a0 but you can't control somebody else's life. It's their life.\"",
      "Knowles also wrote about an untrue rumor that surfaced during Beyonc\u00e9's first pregnancy, where people said she wasn't carrying the baby.",
      "\"She went on a show in Australia and she had this very broad cloth type of dress,\" Knowles said about Beyonc\u00e9. \"She wasn't huge pregnant. She was very proud of her little stomach and she bent over and the fabric of the dress bent \u2026 they started this vicious, horrible rumor that she wasn't pregnant.\"",
      "Knowles expressed her heartache over the situation and anger over people thinking her daughter faked a pregnancy and used prosthetics.",
      "\"I was never so enraged because this should have been a sacred experience and what they didn't know is that my child had been through a couple miscarriages, which were so painful.\"",
      "Knowles admitted she did not speak up even as the devastating rumor escalated, saying that Beyonc\u00e9 thought it would go away and handles these situations well.",
      "\"I'm not so good at that. I will cuss you out about my kids,\" Knowles said. \"That was one of the worst times of my life. It really was. I would cry, I would get so mad and I would get so upset.\"",
      "Divorces and moving forward",
      "When she decided to get divorced from Mathew Knowles, she said she spent a week in bed depressed. Her longtime therapist gave her an exercise to do: Make a list of accomplishments and failures.",
      "\"I had such an easy time writing the bad stuff. When I got to the positive stuff, I had such a hard time,\" she said. \"What I realized about myself is that I wasn't really comfortable with people telling me great things about me.\"",
      "She said she had not taken credit for some of her accomplishments in the past, like her work with Destiny's Child in an effort to be humble. She would tell herself, \"it's not about you.\"",
      "But then she started making her list.",
      "\"I started getting mad and writing those things down,\" she said. \"I started my salon. It was a success. You know, I raised some great kids. All the people I've met in my life, like I have had a hell of a life.\"",
      "Four years after her divorce from Mathew Knowles, Tina Knowles married actor Richard Lawson. They were together for 10 years. She said she feels grateful for the relationship, even though it ultimately ended.",
      "\"I've known Richard for 40-something years and I think he's a great person,\" she said. \"So I don't have any regrets about the time that we spent together. I did feel a lot of pressure about ending the marriage because I had so many people to come up to me and tell me about that hope, but \u2013 it's not a tragedy.\"",
      "She said she would love to find love again, but is at peace if she doesn't.",
      "\"I am finally feeling \u2014 it is sad that I'm 71 years old and I know that I am enough and if I don't I'm gonna be just fine because I got such a full, great life. And I'm so blessed, and you know, it's gonna be \u2013 it's all good.\"",

      "\"I've always tried to take care of myself. I just \u2026 was in disbelief,\" she told King.",
      "The American Cancer Society recommends a mammogram every 1 to 2 years for women over 55. Knowles explained she missed her routine screening during the COVID-19 pandemic and didn't reschedule until last year. Doctors then found two tumors. One was benign, and the other had Stage 1 cancer.",
      "She was later informed that had she maintained her regular screenings, detection might have occurred at Stage 0, which according to the American Cancer Society is when the cancer has not spread beyond the breast tissue.",

      "\"It's about God walking with you into something and protecting you,\" Knowles said through tears. \"And I went in there feeling just like God has got me.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "In 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled and end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"",
      "And the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women\u00a0in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "He spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.",
      "His charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"",
      "The 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.",
      "His writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.",
      "His first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! \u2026 Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"",
      "And despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.",
      "\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"",
      "In 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"",
      "He then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\""

      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 17:28:50 -0400",
    "summary": "Some employees working on the CDC's measles response were warned they could face layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "He spoke with CBS News as a member of the labor union American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents NIOSH employees in Ohio that were impacted by Kennedy's layoffs.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",
      "An official said Tuesday that the CDC was now \"scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support\" to Texas and other states now facing outbreaks.",

      "Beijing's export-reliant economic model is \"unsustainable\" and harms both China and the rest of the world, Bessent added.

      "The stock market rose sharply on Wednesday following news that the trade war could cool off, and after President Trump said he has no plans to oust Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "Earlier this month, China hiked its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports \u2014 although those import taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products from China.",
      "Bessent made it clear in his speech that the Trump administration wants to see changes in China's export-based economy.",

      "A dozen states sued the Trump administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday to stop its tariff policy, saying it is unlawful and has brought chaos to the American economy.",
      "The lawsuit said the policy put in place by President Trump has been subject to his \"whims rather than the sound exercise of lawful authority.\"",
      "It challenged Trump's claim that he could arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The suit asks the court to declare the tariffs to be illegal, and to block government agencies and its officers from enforcing them.",
      "A message sent to the Justice Department for comment was not immediately returned.",
      "The states listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit were Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont.",
      "In a release, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called Trump's tariff scheme \"insane.\"",
      "She said it was \"not only economically reckless \u2014 it is illegal.\"",
      "Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said, \"Trump's lawless and chaotic tariffs are a massive tax on Connecticut families and a disaster for Connecticut businesses and jobs.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai in response accused Democratic attorneys general of \"prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump\" and said, \"The Trump Administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing\u2014both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.\"",
      "The lawsuit maintained that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs and that the president can only invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act when an emergency presents an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" from abroad.",
      "\"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, sued the Trump administration in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California over the tariff policy, saying his state could lose billions of dollars in revenue as the largest importer in the country.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to Newsom's lawsuit, saying the Trump administration \"remains committed to addressing this national emergency that's decimating America's industries and leaving our workers behind with every tool at our disposal, from tariffs to negotiations.\"",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday said the Trump administration has an \"opportunity for a big deal\" on trade with China, a day after Mr. Trump signaled tariffs on China would come down \"substantially.\"",
      "Capital Economics projects the U.S. will lower import taxes on Chinese goods to as low as 60%. If Mr. Trump acts quickly to lower tariffs on China and brings them down low enough, investors believe a recession could be averted.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. These companies say they're investing in domestic factories.",
    "story": [
      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",
      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",

      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production.

      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:49:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

      "Beginning May 5, the Education Department will begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which claws back delinquent debts by withholding payments such as tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers are in default and 4 million more could be in the same position in a few months, which would put nearly a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio in default, according to the Education Department. Less than 40% of borrowers are current on their student loan payments.",
      "In the next two weeks, those in default will receive emails informing them of the next steps and urging them to look into repayment options. Wage garnishment notices will be sent out later this summer.",
      "No federal student loan has been referred to collections since March 2020 when President Trump paused payments and interest accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden administration extended that pause, which ended in October 2024.",
      "Former President Joe Biden sought to wipe out student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his four years in the White House, but the effort was repeatedly rejected by courts, including a 2023 ruling by the Supreme Court. Still, the Biden administration erased student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through other forgiveness programs.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the Biden administration \"misled\" borrowers about its authority to waive debt.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker's first-quarter results showing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionaire was focused on leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe, causing the stock price to deflate.",
      "Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that he plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE, beginning next month.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\"",
      "Tariff impact",
      "The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas.",
      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.",

      "Personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but fell sharply during the pandemic itself as Americans were buoyed by trillions of dollars in government aid and relief.",
      "LegalShield now expects bankruptcies to surge as soon as this this summer. \"Consumers are calling lawyers to ask questions because they can't pay their bills or are having trouble, and they ask about the process of filing for bankruptcy,\" Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Why are more Americans mulling bankruptcy?",
      "Heavy consumer debts, years of stiff inflation and higher interest rates are squeezing Americans' budgets, according to Layton. Billing disputes, debt collections and other leading indicators of bankruptcy are also on the rise.",
      "\"Our members are calling and saying, 'I don't have enough money at the end of month to pay my bills.' They're asking which ones to pay and which ones to put off. They're saying, 'They're coming to get my car \u2014 what can I do about these things?'\" Layton said.",
      "The jump in Americans who are considering declaring bankruptcy reflects the tough economic economic and financial conditions that have prevailed 2020, experts said. Total household debt as of the end of 2024 hit an all-time of\u00a0$18 trillion, while the percentage of Americans falling seriously behind on their debts also rose last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "\"Quarterly filings from the U.S. courts will come out soon, and I'd expect to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in personal bankruptcy filings from the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025,\" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am not surprised attorneys say they're hearing from people who are looking to file for bankruptcy now because it's April. This is when people get their tax returns, so they have money to file for bankruptcy with,\" she added, noting that it costs money to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the most common type of personal filing. \"If they are getting their tax return, that's the time to file because they have an infusion of money.\"",
      "Economists warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including heavy tariffs on China and other key trading partners, is likely to stoke inflation while dampening economic growth. Still, the flood of people weighing bankruptcy now reflects the steady rise in financial stress in recent years rather than current economic conditions, Foohey emphasized.",
      "\"Rising [bankruptcy] filings will show that people have been struggling with their finances for years when they do file, and things have been getting incrementally worse month after month now for years,\" she said. \"It's been building, and it's only going to get worse unless something is done about inflation, unless something is done about tariffs.\"",
      "When should you file for bankruptcy?",
      "As Foohey notes, bankruptcy typically comes after a prolonged period of financial stress. Although some Americans struggle to overcome the stigma of bankruptcy, experts recommend filing for protection sooner rather than later in order to shield their assets from creditors.",
      "Filing for bankruptcy can help an individual liquidate their assets to pay off their debt or create a repayment plan. Individuals may file for file\u00a0Chapter 7\u00a0or\u00a0Chapter 13\u00a0bankruptcy, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal courts.",
      "But bankruptcy expert Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Law, said declaring bankruptcy accomplishes one thing: wiping out people's debt.",
      "\"It doesn't get you a job, it doesn't get you a raise, it doesn't put money on the table,\" he said. \"Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't make sense when things are still on the way down. It makes sense to file when you're in the hole, but starting to climb out of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Data shows the IRS' Direct File free tax-filing tool has helped save taxpayers money. Now lawmakers want to know why the Trump administration may soon pull the plug on the program.",
      "The Trump administration is planning on ending Direct File, the Associated Press reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the plan. The program, launched during Joe Biden's presidency, has been credited by some users with making it easier and cheaper to file their taxes, saving the average user $160 in tax preparation fees and hours of their time, according to the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group focused on enhancing financial fairness and security for Americans.",
      "But the IRS has also faced blowback to Direct File from private tax prep companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software.",
      "\"Direct File is and has been a solution in search of a problem, a drain on critical IRS resources and a waste of taxpayer dollars,\" Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for the commercial tax preparation company Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, told the AP.",
      "DirectFile was used by about 141,000 taxpayers in 12 states when it debuted in 2024, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Although it was expanded to 25 states in 2025, the IRS hasn't yet released data on how many people used it during the tax season that ended on April 15.",
      "$100 billion on tax prep",
      "Americans spend more than $100 billion each year to prepare and file their returns, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Direct File was developed as a method to help taxpayers avoid paying tax-prep and filing fees.",
      "However, Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies \u2014 including Intuit, the owner of TurboTax, H&R Block \u2014 have complained the Direct File program is a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist. One such service is Free File, a partnership between the IRS and tax-prep companies.",
      "On Monday, more than 170 Democratic and independent lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and IRS acting commissioner Michael Faulkender asking them to commit to keeping Direct File open and operating. No Republican lawmakers signed the letter.",
      "\"Ending this free, easy-to-use and popular program would be an insult to American taxpayers, eliminating an important alternative to commercial options provided by the tax prep industry,\" the Democratic lawmakers, led by by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote in the April 21 letter.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, with plans to eliminate up to 40% of its roughly 100,000-person workforce after the end of tax filing season, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News. The agency is also expected to shed more than 20,000 IRS employees through its Deferred Resignation Program offer.",
      "Those changes are part of the Trump administration's efforts, overseen by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending.",
      "\"No decisions on the future of Direct File have been made as of yet,\" a Treasury spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It is a failed program at a cost of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars per year.\"",
      "Pushback against Direct File",
      "Direct File has drawn pushback from some Republican lawmakers, with more than 20 GOP representatives asking President Trump to \"immediately end the IRS' unlawful Direct File pilot program upon taking office in January,\" according to a Dec. 10 statement from Rep. Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska.",
      "\"The program's creation and ongoing expansion pose a threat to taxpayers' freedom from government overreach, and its shaky rollout and structural flaws have already come at a steep price,\" the Republican lawmakers said in their\u00a0letter.",
      "The IRS spent about $13 million on the Direct File pilot in 2024, according a December\u00a0report from the GAO. That funding came from money the tax agency received from the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed into law in 2022.",
      "While consumer advocacy groups and some tax experts have praised Direct File for creating a free pathway for some taxpayers to file their returns, the service hasn't earned universal praise.",
      "Direct File was \"problematic\" from the start, David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that disseminates research and analysis on the government's effects on the economy, told the AP.",
      "Pointing to the program's costs, Williams noted that many people who start the free-filing process never finish. According to the IRS, while 423,450 taxpayers logged into Direct File in 2024, only 140,803 of them submitted accepted returns.",
      "Despite those criticisms, taxpayers who have used Direct File give the program high marks. About 96% of taxpayers who used the 2024 pilot program said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the service, a Code for America survey found.",
      "\"Taxpayers have spoken loudly and clearly: Direct File works well for them, and more Americans want access to it,\" the April 21 letter from Warren, Sanders and other lawmakers said.",

      "The U.S. economy will grow 1.8% this year, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook, down 0.9% from January and a full percentage point from last year's projection of 2.8%. Growth for 2026 is expected to be slightly lower at 1.7%.",

      "The organization does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025, but said the odds have now risen to 37% from 25% as of October 2024. Other analysts have said the likelihood could be even higher. James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, projects the odds of a U.S. recession are 50-50.",

In response to his comments, Mr. Trump took aim at the Fed chair, writing in a\u00a0social media post\u00a0the following day that the central bank should be cutting interest rates.",
      "Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" the president wrote.",
      "Uncertainty over Mr. Trump's trade policy is what's driving the IMF's projection of a U.S. economic slowdown. The international financial agency said trade was stable in 2024 and was expected to remain that way, but that the landscape changed in light of America's tariff war with trade partners.",
      "\"This on its own is a major negative shock to growth,\" an executive summary of the monetary fund's report said.",
      "Tariffs have already thrown sand in the gears of U.S. small businessess, the American auto industry, and other sectors that import their supplies from abroad.",
      "The trade war also led to a weaker forecast for China, one of America's top trading partners. The IMF projects the country's economy will expand 4% this year, down roughly half a point from its previous forecast. President Trump's\u00a0tariffs on China now total 145%. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods total 125%.",
      "The IMF's forecasts were finalized April 4, just after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs. The international agency warned that further escalation of the trade war could stymie both near- and long-term growth. However, given the forecast hinges on policy, if Mr. Trump backs down on his tariff threats \u2014 reciprocal tariffs introduced on April 2 are currently on pause for 90 days \u2014 it could reshape the IMF's outlook.",

      "Harvard University on Monday said it has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding.",
      "In announcing the suit, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a letter\u00a0to the Harvard community that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants.",
      "The lawsuit comes after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "\"These actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers and the standing of American higher education in the world,\" Garber wrote.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding, claiming that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "\"Defendants' actions threaten Harvard's academic independence and place at risk critical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus. And they are part of a broader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Trump administration said, \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families, is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\"",
      "Research at Harvard has helped develop drugs that treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, led to the development of nanofibers that protect first responders and service members, and contributed to innovation in cancer-detecting artificial intelligence technology, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Harvard leaders frame the Trump administration's demands as a threat not only to the Ivy League school but also to the autonomy that the Supreme Court has long granted American universities. For the White House, Harvard presents a major hurdle in its effort to force change at universities that Republicans claim have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism.",
      "In its suit, Harvard alleges the Trump administration also \"failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress required under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring the freeze unlawful.\"",
      "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin from programs that receive federal funding.",

      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",
      "The White House declined further comment.",
      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",
      "Also Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.",
      "\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really \u2014 I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"",
      "William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"",
      "\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.",

    "summary": "U.S. Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to impose sweeping penalties on Google after a court ruled the tech giant is a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",

      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

      "Trump administration officials argue that it has\u00a0overstepped its authority and should have a more limited mission, amounting to an existential crisis for \u00a0government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules.

It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post.

      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",

      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",

      "On Wednesday, Powell also reiterated that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now, also sparking pushback from Mr. Trump.",
      "\"He's too late. Always too late. A little slow and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it and \u2014 if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday at the White House.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose board members could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that presidents may not legally fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "But Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, reported Reuters on Wednesday. And in March, the White House dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "Even if Mr. Trump were able to remove Powell, it's not clear that doing so would change the direction of the central bank's decisions on interest rates. Those calls are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC \u2014 a 12-member group tasked with setting monetary policy \u2014 and not at Powell's discretion.",
      "Who would replace Powell?",
      "Fed governor Kevin Warsh, 55, is a former Morgan Stanley executive who was nominated to the Fed's board of governors by President George W. Bush.",
      "Mr. Trump is considering selecting Warsh as Powell's replacement, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0on Thursday. However, Warsh has advised Mr. Trump to allow Powell to remain through the end of his term, the publication added.",
      "Widely respected, Warsh is considered to be even more hawkish \u2014 or willing to allow interest rates to remain high to control inflation \u2014 than Powell, according to a January blog post\u00a0by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently ordered modifications to a room next to the Pentagon press briefing room to retrofit it with a makeup studio that can be used to prepare for television appearances, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The price tag for the project was several thousand dollars, according to two of the sources, at a time when the administration is searching for cost-cutting measures.",
      "\"Changes and upgrades to the Pentagon Briefing Room are nothing new and routinely happen during changes in an administration,\" a Defense Department spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The renovation that was initially planned was estimated to cost more than $40,000, but the ideas were scaled back, sources said.",
      "After CBS News published its report, the defense secretary responded in a post on X, \"Totally fake story. No 'orders' and no 'makeup.'\"",
      "Hegseth, before becoming defense secretary, was a morning show co-host on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\" Since his nomination, he has vowed to emphasize improvements in the armed forces' warfighting abilities and military readiness.",
      "An in-house construction crew renovated the adjacent green room earlier this year. The room previously had minimal furnishings \u2014 a table with chairs, a TV, photos of former defense secretaries and a mirror on the back of the door, one source said.",
      "The table was removed and a new chair and large mirror with makeup lighting was installed, another source said.",
      "Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News, according to multiple sources. The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, and the defense secretary's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, also a former Fox producer, expressed their approval for the upgrade before it was undertaken, one of the sources said.",
      "The Defense Department spokesperson said the green room will be available to senior leaders and VIPs prior to press engagements.",
      "The new items, including a director's chair, came from existing inventories, the spokesperson said. A new countertop was constructed by facilities services staff.",
      "\"For this upgrade we were deliberately conservative and opted for several less expensive, on-hand materiel solutions,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Hegseth hasn't used the press room to brief reporters. But it has been a set for his TV appearances, including one with Fox this week in which he blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for the revelation that he sent sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat that he created.",
      "He did not deny news reports that he shared real-time operational information with family members before strikes in Yemen were carried out. He didn't explain why his wife, who is not a Defense Department employee, was in the text chat. That was the second Signal group with whom Hegseth shared planning details about the Houthi airstrikes, which took place in mid-March. The first Signal chat, a principals group which comprised top national security officials, was created by national security adviser Michael Waltz, and its existence was exposed by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the group in error by Waltz.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 19:19:31 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump also signed an executive order to enforce laws on the books about universities disclosing large foreign gifts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order aiming to change the college accreditation process so colleges are accredited based on \"results,\" with the president wondering aloud about looking into the math capabilities of students admitted to Harvard University and Yale University.",
      "The president also signed an order to enforce laws on the books requiring universities to disclose when they accept large foreign gifts, with one of Mr. Trump's top aides specifically calling out Harvard as a school they believe has violated the law. Federal law requires higher education institutions that receive federal funds to disclose any gifts or contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year, and some in Congress are trying to lower that threshold to $50,000.",
      "The new executive orders come as the president has singled out Harvard University. His administration has frozen billions in federal funding to Harvard, demanded sweeping changes to school policies and suggested it should lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Colleges and universities are accredited to ensure they meet basic standards by third-party entities, not the federal government, though the Department of Education decides which accrediting agencies to recognize. The accreditation process has broad implications since the government uses it to\u00a0determine which schools are allowed to participate in federal student aid programs, which distribute billions in student loans and grants.",
      "The executive order directs the Department of Education to \"hold accountable\" any college accreditors that \"fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law\" \u2014 including by terminating or suspending the accreditors' federal recognition. It specifically singles out accrediting agencies that require schools to \"engage in unlawful discrimination ... under the guise of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives.\" The order also says the Department of Education should start recognizing new college accreditors.",
      "The Trump administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on \"woke ideology\" instead of results, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said. The executive order Mr. Trump signed affects law schools and graduate programs as well.",
      "\"The basic idea is to force accreditation to be focused on the merit and the actual results that these universities are providing, as opposed to how woke these universities have gotten,\" Scharf said ahead of Mr. Trump signing the executive order. \"So we're setting up new accreditation pathways, we're charging the Department of Education to really look holistically at this accreditation mess and hopefully make it much better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wanted to know if the executive order he was signing will \"look into\" people who he says go to prestigious schools like Harvard or Princeton but can't do basic math.",
      "\"Will we look into the past people that they've taken?\" Mr. Trump asked Scharf. \"For instance, I hear all about certain great schools. And then we read where they're going to teach people basic math, math that we can all do very easily, but they can't do there.\"",
      "\"When universities are not performing appropriately, whether that's in admission or whether that's in their actual instructional activities, that's certainly something that accreditors should be considering that right now we believe they're not doing a good enough job of,\" Scharf responded.",
      "The president also signed an executive order charging federal departments and agencies to make sure universities are following the law in disclosing the acceptance of large foreign gifts.",
      "\"We believe that certain universities, including, for example, Harvard, have routinely violated this law and this law has not been effectively enforced,\" Scharf said. \"So this executive order charges your departments and agencies with enforcing the laws on the books with respect to foreign gifts to American universities.\"",
      "Scharf didn't offer evidence or details on how Harvard has allegedly violated the foreign gift disclosure law. CBS News has reached out to Harvard for comment.",
      "Harvard University on Monday announced it filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Several other schools, including Columbia University, have faced similar funding freezes, with the Trump administration alleging the schools have responded inadequately to antisemitism.",
      "The president on Wednesday also signed executive actions to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), make sure schoolchildren are adequately trained in artificial intelligence, boost apprenticeships and allow educators to enforce school discipline policies.",

      "\"I truly love the job of being a United States senator, but in my heart I know it is time to pass the torch. So, I am announcing today I will not be seeking reelection at the end of my term,\" Durbin said in a video posted to his social media accounts.",
      "When he finishes his current term, Durbin will be tied with former Illinois Sen. Shelby Collum, who served from 1883 to 1913, as the longest-serving U.S. senator in Illinois history.",
      "Durbin, 80, expressed his gratitude to the people of Illinois for electing him to the Senate for so many years, and said he was honored by the responsibility bestowed on him.",
      "\"Right now the challenges facing our country are historic and unprecedented,\" he continued. \"The threats to our democracy and our way of life are very real, and I can assure you, I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.\"",
      "Durbin called his fellow Illinois senator, Tammy Duckworth, a \"trusted friend and effective leader,\" and said she will be a \"real asset\" to the state and the nation as Illinois' next senior senator.",
      "Durbin is the senior senator for Illinois. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, filling the seat left vacant by longtime Sen. Paul Simon.",
      "He is the 5th most senior member of the Senate, and also serves at the Senate Democratic Whip, the second-highest ranking position for the party in the Senate. He was first elected to this leadership post by Senate Democrats in 2005, and has been reelected to it every two years since.",
      "Durbin is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also serves on the Appropriations Committee and the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. His retirement is expected to serve as the impetus for a broader shakeup of the Democratic Senate leadership.",
      "He introduced the Dream Act, which would give undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and grew up here a path to citizenship, in 2001 alongside Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). He was also a force behind the establishment of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival Program, or DACA, created by President Barack Obama in 2012.",
      "He also championed the First Step Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2018, a bipartisan criminal justice bill that reformed sentencing laws and provided more opportunities for incarcerated people to re-enter society upon their release.",
      "Durbin and his wife, Loretta Schaefer Durbin, live in Springfield, Illinois. He has three children \u2013 Paul, Jennifer and Christine, his oldest daughter who died in 2008 from complications from a congenital heart condition.",
      "While no one has officially signaled their intentions to toss their names into the ring for Durbin's seat, some of the Illinois politicians most often talked about as a potential replacements include 14th District U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and 8th District U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi.",
      "Colleagues pay tribute to Durbin's career",
      "A number of legislators took time Wednesday morning to share tributes to Durbin's long career in politics.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a fellow Democrat, praised Durbin \"for his exemplary career of public service as well as the profound and lasting positive impact he's had on Illinois families and our nation.\" He added:",
      "\"Known for his legendary work ethic, Senator Durbin has led the fight to expand access to affordable health care, invest in our state's infrastructure, tackle gun violence, defend Dreamers, improve public health, protect working families, and more. His expert leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee ensured the confirmation of a record 235 federal judges, shaping the courts and securing our most fundamental American rights for many years to come.\"",
      "Speaking at an event in Decatur, Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker honored Durbin, saying, \"Let's all recognize someone serving us for decades in Washington D.C., representing the state of Illinois with enormous integrity and honor, is something we should all appreciate no matter what political party someone belongs to.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said Durbin \"has given Illinois a lifetime of principled leadership \u2014 grounded in decency, driven by purpose, and always guided by the people he served,\" and added \"Illinois is stronger because of him and the work he's championed will carry on.\"",
      "Rep. Delia Ramirez, a colleague and fellow Democrat, called Durbin a \"trusted leader, a mentor to many, and a champion for working people in Illinois.\"",
      "\"As he announces his much-deserved retirement, I am feeling thankful for his work and service to the people of Illinois and our nation,\" she wrote. \"Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to learn from you and partner with you on so many important issues. As the proud daughter of immigrants, the spouse of a Dreamer, and the Congresswoman of IL-03, I also extend my deepest gratitude for your unwavering commitment to defending our immigrant communities.\"",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson thanked Durbin for \"over 40 years of fighting for the people of Illinois.\" He called him a \"principled and pragmatic leader,\" praised his bipartisanship and his work in the senate.",
      "\"Time and time again, he delivered real results to the working people of Chicago \u2013 investing in our airports and our train stations, defending Dreamers and immigrants, and fighting to end gun violence. He was a champion for young children and early childhood education, and he fought for mental health services for our young people,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"Our city, our state, and our country are stronger due to his decades of service.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama, who served alongside Durbin in the Senate before his presidential run, also released a statement on the decision, writing, \"As an Illinois voter, I couldn't be prouder that our senator for the last 28 years has been one of the finest in the country. Dick Durbin has always fought the good fight on behalf of working families, and his integrity shines through in everything he does.\"",
      "With Durbin vacating his Senate seat, many prominent Democrats are expected to throw their hat in the ring. CBS News Chicago Political Analyst and former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said it's not impossible that a Republican could win the seat.",
      "\"I think that is a very remote possibility, given the nature of electorate here in Illinois, but I will sound a cautionary note. President Trump did very well not only across Illinois south of I-80, but made inroads in Cook County and DuPage County, and quite frankly did better than expected in the city of Chicago,\" she said.",
      "Lightfoot said she has no plans to run for the seat herself.",
      "\"No, I don't see that happening,\" she said. \"I can tell you private citizen Lightfoot is just fine where I am.\"",
      "Political scientist and professor Stephen Caliendo said there's more than meets the eye behind many of the statements from politicians in response to this announcement today.",
      "\"Part of what you're seeing with the praise for Senator Durbin, not to suggest at all that it's not authentic, but it's also seeking his blessing,\" he said. \"I don't know that he would come forward with a specific endorsement. Certainly not this early in a race, he wouldn't, but anybody who runs would love to have him alongside them on the campaign trail.\"",
      "Caliendo said November 2026 really isn't far away, and the race for campaign money has really already started. He believes several members of Congress from Illinois could run, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi holding a huge fundraising lead, with more than $18 million on hand in his campaign fund.",
      "\"He's been hoarding money for some time, and the others have been in a little bit tighter races for their seats, so they've had to spend a little bit more in recent campaigns, but he's been collecting money and certainly the suggestion would be that he was desiring a higher office,\" Caliendo said.",
      "Rep. Lauren Underwood has more than $1 million available in her campaign fund after raising nearly $400,000 between January and March, mostly from individual contributions. Rep. Robin Kelly has more than $2 million I her campaign fund, after raising more than $185,000 between January and March, also nearly all of it from individual contributions.",
      "Stratton also is considered a likely Senate candidate now that Durbin is retiring. She has less than $100,000 in her campaign fund, but can't use it for a Senate race since the money was raised for a state race, not a federal race. However, she could potentially get significant financial backing from Pritzker, a billionaire who hasn't been shy about spending big to support political allies.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has repeatedly shared an image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos in an effort to link the Maryland man, who was mistakenly deported\u00a0to El Salvador on March 15, to the notorious MS-13 gang.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump again shared a photo of Abrego Garcia's left hand on social media, alleging he \"had 'MS-13' tattooed onto his knuckles.\" The image shows the characters \"M,\" \"S,\" \"1\" and \"3\" digitally added above Abrego Garcia's existing tattoos \u2014 a leaf, a smiley face, a cross and a skull \u2014 along with labels describing each symbol beneath.",
      "Many people online recognized the labels as digitally added, but some alleged they were designed to appear as part of Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos and accused the Trump administration of trying to mislead the public. The White House has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the image and who added the labels.",
      "The experts and researchers we spoke with acknowledged the tattoos could carry gang-related symbolism, but they said the markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership. They also cast doubt on Trump's claims that the marijuana leaf represents an \"M,\" the smiley face \"S,\" the cross \"1\" and the skull \"3.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "He was deported and sent to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, designed to hold the most dangerous gang members, before being moved to another facility as his case attracted widespread attention. As legal efforts to bring him back to the U.S. continue, the Trump administration has cited Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos as evidence of alleged MS-13 affiliation.",
      "Roberto Lovato, an assistant professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose memoir chronicled growing up in California during MS-13's early years, said although symbols are \"notoriously difficult to interpret,\" he does not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos are suggestive of MS-13 membership.",
      "Lovato also said current gang members he has spoken to do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos represent MS-13.",
      "Maya Barak, an associate professor of criminal justice studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told CBS News that tattoos such as devil horns, the letters \"M\" and \"S\" and the numbers \"1\" and \"3\" have been used by MS-13 members. The National Gang Center and FBI both cited variations of \"MS,\" \"13\" and devil horns as tattoos associated with MS-13.",
      "A community activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told CBS News he has worked with gang members for more than 25 years and has never seen a series of finger tattoos like Abrego Garcia's linked to MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration's \"border czar\" Tom Homan told ABC News \"you can't ignore a tattoo\" but said people are not being labeled as gang members strictly based on their tattoos.",

      "David Kennedy, a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said identifying someone as a gang member is not a simple process and often requires a multi-pronged approach.",
      "\"I'm not aware of any statutory framework that relies just on tattoos or honestly on any one single aspect,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Lovato agreed that using the tattoos alone as evidence \"would not hold water in a court of law.\"",
      "Kennedy also noted the transient nature of gang membership as another hurdle to identifying active members.",
      "\"Even if we take the tattoos to be indicative of MS-13 membership, that's very often not a permanent status and people stop being involved [in the gang],\" Kennedy said.",
      "Maya Barak co-authored a report that highlighted the potential for mislabeling people as MS-13 members based on their perceived race or immigration status as well as their style of dress and tattoos.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race for his long-held seat representing Illinois \u2014 and a broader shakeup of Democratic leadership in the Senate.",
      "Durbin, 80, has served since 2005 as the Democratic whip, the second-ranking position in Democratic leadership. First under former Democratic leader Harry Reid and now under Chuck Schumer, the Illinois Democrat has shepherded the caucus through votes, while being a prominent voice on the leadership team for two decades.",
      "After the 2026 elections, the whip position will be up for grabs. And the announcement has spurred whispers about a possible successor.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz's name has been floated as being among the list of Democrats who could take up the mantle. Schatz has represented Hawaii in the Senate since 2012, and currently serves as chief deputy whip. Schatz celebrated Durbin's career in a statement Wednesday, calling the Illinois Democrat a \"mentor and friend.\"",
      "Other members of the Senate Democratic leadership could also vie for the No. 2 post. The caucus elevated Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to the No. 3 position in Senate leadership in the last internal elections, along with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to the fourth-ranking post. Both are possible candidates for the whip role, though they each sought the Democratic nomination for the White House in 2020, and could have ambitions beyond the Senate in 2028. The caucus conducts leadership elections behind closed doors before the start of each new Congress.",
      "Durbin's retirement also opens up the coveted top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he's been the top Democrat since 2021. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, is widely expected to take his place at the top of the panel.",
      "The Illinois Democrat's announcement of his planned departure comes months after the bruising 2024 election, where Democrats lost power in the White House and the Senate \u2014 leading some members of the party to call for a new generation of leadership to come forward. And a broader shakeup remains possible, especially as questions about Schumer's leadership have continued to swirl, though they've died down considerably in recent weeks.",
      "Facing the threat of a government shutdown in March, Schumer, who's led the caucus since 2017, delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel a GOP-led funding measure to passage after he had initially pledged to oppose it. The move prompted intense frustration among his party, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision, arguing that a shutdown would have been worse than the funding measure for the nation, delivering sole power to the executive branch.",
      "Democrats had widely opposed the measure and expressed frustration with its spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. Some progressives suggested that a shutdown was a better alternative, while others simply took issue with Schumer's changing stance. But in the end, nine Democrats and independents also voted to advance the measure, including Schumer's No. 2, Durbin \u2014 and Schatz.",
      "As attention is now turning to Senate Democratic leadership, Senate Republicans elected a new slate after the 2024 elections, tapping Sen. John Thune to lead the conference after Sen. Mitch McConnell opted to step down after 17 years at the helm.",

      "On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security argued his arrest, which has attracted national attention, was a \"direct result of his own actions and statements.\" A DHS spokesperson said Hermosillo approached a Border Patrol agent, said he had entered the U.S. illegally and identified himself as a Mexican citizen.",
      "The department also posted a copy of Hermosillo's sworn statement on X in which Hermosillo responded \"yes\" when asked if he had entered the U.S. illegally. The document shows a child-like signature that reads \"Jose.\"",

      "According to his family, Hermosillo lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but was in Tucson earlier this month visiting his girlfriend's family. He left his girlfriend's relative's home and wandered away during the night, and it was during this walk that Hermosillo was detained by CBP, his parents said.",
      "Details of the arrest remain unclear. The initial April 9 criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Arizona by a Border Patrol agent says Hermosillo was found \"at or near Nogales, Arizona without the proper immigration documents.\" The document referred to Hermosillo as an \"alien\" and charged him with \"improper entry,\" a misdemeanor offense.",
      "But DHS later stated that he was arrested in Tucson. According to court documents, Hermosillo told the judge he was a U.S. citizen during his first appearance. A day later, Hermosillo's U.S. birth certificate was made available to the judge.",
      "When CBS News spoke with Hermosillo, he appeared to be distraught and confused. He said he cried every night at the detention center, describing it as a very cold place filled with sick people who were constantly coughing.",
      "\"When I sleep, I dream that I'm still detained,\" Hermosillo said over the phone in Spanish.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a CBS News request to comment on the allegations by Hermosillo and his parents, including about his intellectual disabilities.",

    "summary": "Beginning May 7, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter federal government buildings if they have a Real ID.",
    "story": [
      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had nearly 20 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 30 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Twelve states and the District of Columbia reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.",

    "summary": "The autism study is planning to link confidential data \"with broad coverage in the U.S. population\" in one place for the first time.",
    "story": [
      "The National Institutes of Health is amassing private medical records from a number of federal and commercial databases to give to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new effort to study autism, the NIH's top official said Monday.",
      "The new data will allow external researchers picked for Kennedy's autism studies to study \"comprehensive\" patient data with \"broad coverage\" of the U.S. population for the first time, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said.",
      "\"The idea of the platform is that the existing data resources are often fragmented and difficult to obtain. The NIH itself will often pay multiple times for the same data resource. Even data resources that are within the federal government are difficult to obtain,\" he said in a presentation to the agency's advisers.",
      "Medication records from pharmacy chains, lab testing and genomics data from patients treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service, claims from private insurers and data from smartwatches and fitness trackers will all be linked together, he said.",
      "The NIH is also now in talks with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to broaden agreements governing access to their data, Bhattacharya said.",
      "In addition, a new disease registry is being launched to track Americans with autism, which will be integrated into the data. Advocacy groups and experts have called out Kennedy for describing autism as a \"preventable disease,\" which they say is stigmatizing and unfounded.",
      "Between 10 and 20 outside groups of researchers will be given grant funding and access to the records to produce Kennedy's autism studies. Bhattacharya did not give details on how they would be chosen, but said their selection would be \"run through normal NIH processes.\"",
      "Bhattacharya said the research they will back using the data will be \"the highest quality proposals\" that will range \"from basic science to epidemiological approaches, to other more applied approaches\" to treat and manage autism. He also acknowledged autism's wide variation in how it affects people.",
      "\"I recognize, of course, that autism, there's a range of manifestations ranging from highly functioning children to children that are quite severely disabled. And of course the research will account very carefully for that,\" he said.",
      "While the selected researchers will be able to access and study the private medical data, Bhattacharya said they will not be able to download it. He promised \"state of the art protections\" to protect confidentiality.",
      "By bringing the data into one place, he said it could give health agencies a window into \"real-time health monitoring\" on Americans for studying other health problems too.",
      "\"What we're proposing is a transformative real-world data initiative, which aims to provide a robust and secure computational data platform for chronic disease and autism research,\" he said.",
      "They are planning a \"rapid timeline\" to launch the autism research using this data, he said, but did not give specifics on when it would start or how long the studies would take. Kennedy last week appeared to walk back his earlier prediction that they would have all the answers to autism's causes by September.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Bhattacharya pushed back the timeline, saying that they now hope to have grants going out the door by September for the research.",
      "\"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya said.",

    "summary": "A Maryland school board decided to end parental opt-outs for instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation, sparking the dispute that's before the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A sharply divided Supreme Court appeared likely to require a Maryland school board provide parents with the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "After more than two hours of arguments, the court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who lives in Montgomery County, Maryland, invoked the state's founding and said the county in particular has been a \"beacon\" of religious liberty and tolerance. He told Alan Schoenfeld, who argued for the school board, he was \"surprised\" given that history that \"this is the hill we're going to die on in terms of not respecting religious liberty.\"",
      "\"What is the big deal about allowing them to opt-out of this?\" Justice Samuel Alito asked, noting that the county allows parents to request their children be excused from other areas of instruction, such as sexual education or Halloween or Valentine's Day celebrations. \"What is infeasible about doing that?\"",
      "Kavanaugh echoed Alito, saying, \"I'm not understanding why it's not feasible\" for schools to excuse children from instruction that violate their families' religious beliefs.",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "Several of the justices acknowledged that they had read the picture books that were included in the curriculum, and Alito at one point even read from one, \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" which discusses gay marriage.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "Eric Baxter, who argued on behalf of the families, told the justices that Montgomery County is an \"extreme outlier\" for declining to allow parents to excuse their children despite their religious objections to the content. He said the instruction featuring the books with LGBTQ-themes was \"clearly indoctrinating\" students.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raised the comments, and asked Shoenfeld if they \"suggest a hostility toward religion.\"",
      "Shoenfeld said the remarks were taken out of context but acknowledged they were \"intemperate.\"",
      "Kavanaugh said that as a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he was \"mystified\" by what led the county to eventually end the opt-outs, and said it \"stands alone\" both with the types of books added to the curriculum for young students and in not allowing parents to opt their children out of the instruction.",
      "The school system has said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice. Schoenfeld told the justices that the books sought to \"foster mutual respect in a pluralistic community.\"",
      "It was unclear whether the court would adopt a firm rule that specifies when certain public-school instruction crosses the line from mere exposure to objectionable content into impermissible coercion of students. The justices raised several examples to discern the point at which the right to free exercise of religion would be burdened.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether a parent could request an opt-out for their child whose teacher shows photos from their same-sex wedding or talks about it, or whether a teacher would have to notify a parent if their child had a transgender classmate.",
      "\"This is not just about books,\" she said. \"This is about exposure to people of different sexual orientations and the objection, the sincerely held objection, that children shouldn't be exposed to this?\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Baxter on whether the families were objecting to the \"exposure to the ideas\" portrayed in the books and asked whether they would be pursuing their claim if the storybooks were just on the shelf at the library, rather than incorporated into instruction.",
      "Baxter said his clients would be making the same claim based on their religious beliefs if the picturebooks were just on the shelves.",
      "The school board has warned that accepting the parents' argument that the no-opt-out policy burdened their religious exercise could have harmful effects for public education as a whole.",
      "\"Crediting petitioners' burden theory would not only contravene constitutional text, history, and precedent, but also \u2014 as courts have long recognized \u2014 'leave public education in shreds' by entitling parents to pick and choose which aspects of the curriculum will be taught to their children,\" they wrote in court papers.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union also said that under the parents' assertions, public school families could request exemptions from an array of curricular requirements because of their religious beliefs, including objecting to lessons on major historical figures who are LGBTQ.",
      "\"In sum, requiring public schools to exempt students from secular instruction that they or their parents may find objectionable for religious reasons could throw public schools into disarray, effectively 4 forcing them to tailor their educational materials to align with the religious beliefs of individual students and/or their parents,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "A town hall hosted by Rep. Byron Donalds turned chaotic Tuesday, with audience members repeatedly interrupting the Florida Republican, leading authorities to remove two people \u2014 the latest raucous town hall dominated by protests against President Trump's administration.",
      "Donalds, a three-term congressman running in next year's Florida gubernatorial race, was asked a litany of often-testy questions, several of which focused on billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Audience members booed or cheered \u2014 and, in some cases, angrily left early \u2014 throughout the almost two-hour event at Estero High School in southwest Florida. Donalds occasionally verbally sparred with the protesters.",
      "Two people appeared to be escorted out by the local sheriff's department after yelling pro-Palestinian sentiments while Donalds answered a question about the Israel-Hamas war. During one incident, Donalds said he would have a protester removed if she kept interrupting. \"Let's have a disagreement. But when you're going to stand and yell and disrespect everybody in this room because you think you're being heard, and let's be clear, you're not,\" he said.",
      "Two back-to-back ejections after the crowd goes back and forth with @ByronDonalds on the Israel-Hamas war. The first two removed shouted \u201cfree Palestine\u201d on their way out. pic.twitter.com/SAiXRssOx0",
      "Donalds told reporters after the event he plans on holding more town halls, but he said the interruptions \"got out of hand,\" calling some of them \"rude\" and \"disrespectful\" to other attendees.",
      "\"I could kind of tell from the first question or two what kind of night it was going to be. But you know, that's alright. It's part of the business,\" Donalds told reporters.",
      "The interruptions began quickly. Minutes into the event, a staff member read a pre-submitted question about whether Donalds supports congressional oversight of DOGE. Donalds defended Musk's cost-cutting efforts and said lawmakers are \"letting DOGE complete its work,\" leading some audience members to groan and boo \u2014 though others appeared to cheer Donalds on.",
      "Donalds was also heckled during questions about immigration, gun control measures, DOGE's work in the Social Security Administration, tariffs and diversity programs. He broadly defended Trump administration policies, drawing boos in many cases.",
      "The lawmaker pushed back on protesters in some cases, asking them questions about Biden- and Obama-era programs and arguing critics were not being \"intellectually honest.\" At other points, he encouraged people to \"relax\" and stop heckling: \"You can yell or you can hear,\" he said during an exchange about the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"Is anybody finding this informative?\" Donalds asked the crowd at one point, drawing a mixture of cheers and jeers. \"60-40? That'll work.\"",
      "Donalds is seeking to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A staunch Trump ally, the congressman earned the president's endorsement in February, before Donalds formally launched his gubernatorial campaign.",
      "Monday's event was the latest congressional town hall to get chaotic. Members of both parties have faced adversarial crowds in recent weeks, with protesters often pushing back against Mr. Trump and Musk. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was repeatedly interrupted by protests at a meeting in the Georgia Republican's home district last Tuesday, with police arresting three demonstrators \u2014 two of whom were tased at the scene. That same evening, a town hall hosted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, was also derailed by angry constituents.",
      "Some lawmakers have shied away from hosting in-person events, in some cases shifting to virtual meetings with voters instead. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suggested last month GOP lawmakers should reconsider in-person town halls, saying members of his caucus should communicate with their constituents but \"there are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side sound bites.\"",
      "Donalds said last month he plans to continue holding town halls, brushing off plans to protest the events in an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "\"Quite frankly, I don't care what they do,\" Donalds said. \"I would tell any Democrat that wants to come out there and astroturf my town hall, bring it, because we're going to talk the truth. We're going to talk about what's really going on. I'm not afraid of you.\"",

      "Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador, say the government has failed to provide appropriate responses to a judge's order for expedited discovery and to her questions about facilitating his return to the U.S.",
      "In a letter addressed to U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis, Abrego Garcia's lawyers requested a hearing to be scheduled Wednesday \"to address the government's failure to comply\" with Xinis' order for expedited discovery in the case.",
      "Xinis on Tuesday issued a scathing order denying the Justice Department's objection to some of the discovery in the case, accusing the department of \"continued mischaracterization of the Supreme Court's Order,\" to return Abrego Garcia and writing the \"defendants' objection reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Xinis also denied a Justice Deparmtnet claim that it does not need to commit to answering questions brought by Abrego Garcia's lawyers and can instead claim privilege over the answers.",
      "\"For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders. Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this Court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege,\" Xinis wrote.",
      "\"Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions. That ends now. If Defendants want to preserve their privilege claims, they must support them with the required detail. Otherwise, they will lose the protections they failed to properly invoke.\"",
      "Xinis ordered a speedy fact-finding process after the Trump administration refused to comply with three different court orders, including an order from the Supreme Court, to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. so he can receive due process regarding the Trump administration's claim that he is an MS-13 gang member.",
      "Last week in court, a Justice Department attorney said that the Trump administration would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return only if he arrived at a port of entry and continued to dodge questions from Xinis about what, if anything, the Trump administration is doing to return the man.",
      "Xinis said that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him. Depositions are set to be completed on Wednesday.",
      "But attorneys for Abrego Garcia say all of the discovery produced by the Justice Department has been \"nothing of substance,\" and \"consists entirely of public filings from the dockets, copies of Plaintiffs' own discovery requests and correspondence, and two nonsubstantive cover emails transmitting declarations filed in this case.\" Other questions for which Abrego Garcia's attorneys have sought answers have been \"similarly non-responsive,\" they wrote.",
      "The plaintiff's lawyers said that the government \"artificially\" narrowed Xinis' order for discovery \"to avoid complying with its obligations.\"",
      "\"The Government refuses to respond to interrogatories it claims are 'based on the false premise that the United States can or has been ordered to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador,'\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote, adding that the Justice Department has not provided any information about Abrego Garcia's detention before April 2, although he has been detained in El Salvador since March 15.",
      "They also argued that the government has asserted privilege \"including deliberative process privilege, state secret privilege, and 'governmental privilege' without any foundation for doing so.\"",
      "Justice Department attorneys countered that they have \"put forward a good-faith effort to provide appropriate responses\" to Abrego Garcia's attorneys and added that they plan to file specific privilege claims over information pertaining to Abrego Garcia soon.",
      "The government also said the administration is \"in discussions\" with the Salvadoran government to return Abrego Garcia, but \"any requirement of a more detailed response by the Defendants would be wholly inappropriate and an invasion of diplomatic discussions.\"",
      "One detail of Abrego Garcia's detention in El Salvador may prompt Xinis to seek more information about what the Trump administration knew \u2014 and when \u2014 about his transfer from CECOT, the country's notorious supermax prison, to another detention center.",
      "Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia last week, said he was moved from CECOT on April 9 to another lower-security detention facility in El Salvador.",
      "But in court-mandated, daily status updates ordered by Xinis about Abrego Garcia's condition and what the administration is doing to return him, four different officials \u2014 from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the State Department, and Homeland Security \u2014 each stated that Abrego Garcia was being detained at CECOT after that date.",
      "On Monday, the Trump administration confirmed that Abrego Garcia had been moved to a facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, and reported based on conversations with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador that he is \"in good conditions and in an excellent state of health.\"",

      "The cuts aren't happening immediately, but a senior State Department official told reporters that Rubio's announcement sets forth a road map for future cuts, and Congress has been notified to set the process in motion. The senior official said State Department undersecretaries for the various bureaus must in about 30 days present a plan on how they will eliminate positions.",
      "Rubio reposted \"X\" posts in which Free Press journalists said the move would entail closing 132 offices, moving 137 offices elsewhere, and directing undersecretaries to reduce personnel by anywhere between 15-17%. Another senior State Department official told reporters on Tuesday that the personnel reduction would be 22%.",
      "Among the agency offices to be cut, according to an \"X\" post Rubio reposted, are those intended to further human rights, advance democracy overseas, counter extremism, and prevent war crimes. Asked during Tuesday's departmental press briefing about the department's office of Global Criminal Justice, which plays a role in investigating war crimes and is missing from the proposed \"reorganization\" chart, Pentagon spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that just \"because it's now folded into another larger bureau, doesn't mean that it's gone or we don't care.\"",

      "\"Over the past 15 years, the department's footprint has had unprecedented growth and costs have soared,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"But far from seeing a return on investment, taxpayers have seen less effective and efficient diplomacy. The sprawling bureaucracy created a system more beholden to radical political ideology than advancing America's core national interests.\"",
      "\"That is why today I am announcing a comprehensive reorganization plan that will bring the Department into the 21st Century,\" Rubio continued. \"This approach will empower the Department from the ground up, from the bureaus to the embassies. Region-specific functions will be consolidated to increase functionality, redundant offices will be removed, and non-statutory programs that are misaligned with America's core national interests will cease to exist.\"",

    "summary": "FBI directors typically fly on government jets, but they're encouraged to limit personal travel.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Kash Patel emerged as a vocal critic of then-FBI Director Christopher Wray for his use of the government's fleet of private aircraft for personal travel.",
      "The FBI should \"ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country,\" Patel said during his \"Kash's Corner\" podcast in 2023.",
      "Now, Patel himself is the director, and questions have begun circulating inside the FBI about the degree to which Patel is using governmental airplanes for his personal travels.",
      "The FBI declined to share Patel's flight schedule and would not confirm his presence on a number of flights to destinations where he later appeared. During the first weekend in April, for instance, a Boeing 757 owned by the Department of Justice made two round trip flights from Washington to New York.",
      "On Saturday, April 5, the narrow-body jet took a 57-minute flight to Stewart International Airport, a short drive from West Point, where Patel made an appearance at a charity hockey event hosted by the FBI. The next day, the jet was back in the air to JFK Airport, landing just hours before Patel resurfaced in box seats next to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky and watched Capitals star Alex Ovechkin break the NHL scoring record.",
      "The New York Times first reported on Patel's use of FBI aircraft on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear if Patel was on these flights \u2014 and if he was, whether they were purely personal, work related, or both. But on Monday, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee told CBS News in a statement that he wants the answer to those questions.",
      "\"The Judiciary Committee must investigate Director Patel's apparent misuse of taxpayer dollars,\" said U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois. \"The American people expect an FBI Director who focuses on the security and safety of the nation, not someone wrapped up in the trappings of the spotlight.\"",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That enables them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel. And it gives the director the ability to move quickly in an emergency.",
      "If the travel is personal, the director must reimburse the government the cost of a commercial coach airfare. When traveling for personal reasons, the director may bring family or friends, but guest travel must be reimbursed to the government as well. Friends or family members are never allowed to fly on FBI aircraft unaccompanied by the director. It is unclear whether Patel has brought friends or family aboard government jets.",
      "But Durbin said the use of the plane still has limits and questioned whether the use of the aircraft cut against the Trump administration's professed commitment to rooting out government waste.",
      "Patel's use of Gulfstream jets operated by the FBI appears to extend to his frequent trips to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, who is a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by FlightRadar24, including a weekend dash to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 14.",
      "It is unclear if he was aboard on Feb. 24, when one of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets flew from Manassas, Virginia, where the plane is based, to Nashville, stayed on the ground for an hour and 27 minutes before returning to Manassas.",
      "On some occasions, Patel may have traveled for both pleasure and business. An FBI jet flew on March 21 from Washington to Nashville. That day, Patel attended a roundtable meeting with state and local law enforcement officials in Tennessee, and also visited the FBI field office in Nashville. The plane returned to Washington later that afternoon. It is unclear whether he saw Alexis Wilkins, his girlfriend, while he was there.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the FBI said it \"does not comment on travel arrangements for security purposes. All ethical guidelines are followed rigorously.\"",
      "Some bureau veterans told CBS News they have been troubled by the frequent use of government aircraft by FBI executives, making the aircraft less available to support operations in line with the primary mission of investigating crimes, chasing spies and preventing terrorist attacks.",
      "\"Those aircraft have been procured or leased specifically to support operational needs,\" said Christopher O'Leary, a former senior counterterrorism official at the FBI who has used the planes dozens of times for sensitive missions and critical response. \"The concern is that the routine use of them by the director and deputy director for personal travel could take a critical resource offline when they are sometimes needed at a moment's notice.\"",
      "O'Leary and others said they also worry that the use of the planes sets the wrong tone.",
      "\"It's a bad leadership example,\" he told CBS News. \"All agents are provided an FBI vehicle, and they cannot be used for personal use.\u00a0 They can only be used for going to and from work, for official duties or to respond to a crisis and that is strictly enforced.\"",
      "Congressional watchdog advised limits on personal jet travel",
      "In 2013, the Government Accountability Office probed the Justice Department's and the FBI's use of the FBI G5 jets for \"non-mission purposes.\" The report that followed laid out how often and for what reasons the planes were used by the attorney general and the FBI director, the costs associated with the flights and the rules and regulations governing them. At the time, the GAO did not find any specific instances of wrongdoing, although it did emphasize the importance of officials being responsible stewards of taxpayer funds when using the planes.",
      "Diana Maurer, a director at GAO and author of the 2013 report, told CBS News that the same principles that were at play when the congressional watchdog agency did its review remain relevant today.",
      "\"I don't know what the current FBI director did or didn't do, and we haven't updated our 2013 report,\" Mauer said in an interview.\u00a0 \"But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't necessarily mean you should.\"",
      "Maurer noted that government officials should not abuse their privileges at the expense of the taxpayer.",
      "\"Using government aircraft, as FBI Directors are required to do for security reasons, costs significantly more than commercial flights. I hope the FBI and the Department of Justice are considering the implications for taxpayers when the Director uses government aircraft for non-mission purposes.\"",
      "Past FBI directors faced scrutiny",
      "During the years that Wray ran the FBI, his personal use of the jet became a touchstone for conservative critics. Wray occasionally flew from Washington to his hometown of Atlanta, where his family maintained its residence. He drew criticism from Republicans in Congress and some former FBI agents for summoning the G5s to Reagan National Airport from Manassas, a 15-minute flight, rather than being driven 30 miles to the Virginia airport where it maintains a hangar.",
      "FBI whistleblower Steven Friend, a close ally of Patel's who was suspended by the bureau over concerns that his views on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol affected his work, criticized Wray in more than a dozen social media posts for his use of the jets. \"Chris Wray abuses his\u00a0 @FBI jet privileges because he doesn't like to sit in traffic,\" Friend wrote in a Dec. 14, 2023, tweet.",
      "Wray was also raked over the coals by Republican lawmakers for cutting short a Senate oversight hearing in 2023 to fly on an FBI aircraft to a family vacation in the Adirondacks. (Wray at the time pointed out that he had negotiated the length of the hearing with committee staff.) The chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, later questioned Wray's use of the FBI jets and whether it amounted to an abuse of taxpayer money, a suggestion that Wray rejected, noting that he was a \"required use traveler,\" and that he reimbursed the government in every instance he used the planes for personal purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Grassley said the senator is \"still waiting on the FBI\" for records regarding Wray's use of the jets and criticized Democrats and the media, claiming they never showed \"any interest in scrutinizing FBI Directors' travel logs until Kash Patel came on the scene.\" Grassley's office did not respond to a question about whether the senator would continue his oversight of FBI directors' government jet travel while Patel is director.",
      "FBI directors have also at times been sensitive about the potential misuses of the FBI's fleet. In at least one case, a former FBI director went to extraordinary lengths to save the taxpayer money for his air travel.",
      "Soon after he became FBI director in 2013, James Comey traveled back and forth to Connecticut where his family was still living. At the time, Washington was in the midst of a heated budget battle with the possibility that government workers would be furloughed and have their paychecks withheld. So, according to two former law enforcement officials, Comey asked President Barack Obama for a special dispensation from the \"required use\" rule so that he could fly commercial at a much lower cost to the government.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Sunday that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee Trump administration deregulations won't have adverse health impacts on people and the environment.",
      "\"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\" Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldin announced in March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history.",
      "The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates.",
      "Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\"",
      "While Zeldin says the policy changes won't have adverse health effects, The Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, found otherwise. They analyzed EPA data of 12 of the 31 proposed rollbacks and estimate that air pollution would increase as a result of the deregulation that would lead to nearly 200,000 premature deaths and cause more than 10,000 asthma attacks every day in America.",
      "Already, the EPA has provided exemptions to 47 power plants operators from complying with stricter mercury and air toxin standards that are due to go into effect in 2027. Power plants in 23 states are on the list and several are coal plants that emit fine particulate matter, which pose the greatest risk to health. This comes after the EPA announced it would accept emails from companies and industries looking to avoid environmental regulations if they could prove it was in the best interest of national security.",
      "On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries.",
      "\"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\"",
      "Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\"",

The messages were sent the same day Hegseth shared similar operational details in a separate Signal chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, sparking\u00a0widespread concern over how senior officials handle sensitive military information.",

She had previously drawn criticism after the Wall Street Journal reported she joined the defense secretary on official foreign trips and attended high-level meetings with international leaders.",
      "Also included in the chat were Hegseth's brother, Phil Hegseth, and the defense secretary's longtime personal attorney Tim Parlatore. While both hold positions at the Pentagon, it was not clear why either would require advance knowledge of strike plans in this case.",
      "The second Signal chat was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Responding to reporters' questions on Monday, Hegseth said he had spoken to President Trump and \"we're going to continue fighting, on the same page all the way.\"",
      "Hegseth accused the media of taking \"anonymous sources from disgruntled, former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people, and ruin their reputation.\"",
      "In a statement on social media, Defense Department spokeperson Sean Parnell wrote Sunday, \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story. What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "Parnell accused media outlets of \"enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article. They relied only on the words of people who were fired this week and appear to have a motive to sabotage the Secretary and the President's agenda.\"",

    "story": [
      "A showdown in federal court in Denver could help shape the future legal landscape surrounding deportations nationwide.",
      "A high-stakes hearing concluded Monday morning  in a case filed by immigrants' rights groups against the Trump administration. Attorneys for the administration argued that people facing deportation should only be allotted 24 hours' notice to be able to fight their deportation order in court, but attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argued that 24 hours isn't \"reasonable,\" as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"The government wants to give as little notice as possible so they can pull people out of the country without a judge reviewing it,\" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, told CBS News Colorado outside the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse   on Monday.",
      "\"The idea that 24 hours is sufficient for someone who's detained at the Aurora detention facility, who likely doesn't speak English, who may not have a high level of education, who doesn't have a lawyer, who doesn't have access to a phone -- the idea that that person can file a, quote, 'writ of habeas corpus' in 24 hours is preposterous,\" he continued.",
      "Macdonald went on to say that alleged Nazis were afforded more rights\u00a0in court after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under the Trump administration, echoing what a U.S. Appeals Court judge said in Washington, D.C. last month.",
      "Charlotte Sweeney, U.S. District judge for the District of Colorado, said on Monday she wouldn't rule on the case for 24 hours. During that hearing, attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network said 11 people have been deported from Colorado to El Salvador and about 85% of people being held in the Aurora ICE Processing Center -- which has 1,532 beds -- have not yet been able to retain legal counsel, which those groups argue is a violation of their due process rights.",
      "Court records show the hearing lasted just over an hour. In addition to President Trump, the defendants named in the case include U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ICE Denver Field Office Director Robert Gaudian, and Dawn Ceja, warden of the ICE Processing Center in Aurora.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court issued a rare weekend ruling\u00a0temporarily halting the Trump administration's plan to deport more Venezuelan migrants from a Texas detention facility under a seldom-used wartime law passed in 1798, the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The president has invoked the Alien Enemies Act, allowing the executive branch to detain or deport noncitizens it deems \"dangerous,\" particularly those administration officials say are part of the gang Tren de Aragua. Last month, the administration used the law to send more than 200 people to a\u00a0prison in El Salvador.",
      "The Supreme Court's weekend ruling came as mass protests continued across the country, including in Colorado, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration policies. The administration is urging the court to reconsider its decision blocking the deportations.",
      "Now, El Salvador's president has proposed exchanging the deported migrants for political prisoners held in Venezuela.",
      "In Denver, a federal court recently barred the removal of any noncitizens within Colorado\u00a0who are or will be subject to the Alien Enemies Act. Some of those previously deported from Colorado have already been sent to the El Salvador prison, according to their attorneys.",
      "At issue is what kind of legal rights migrants have to challenge the government's allegations before they are removed from the U.S.",
      "Trump has said the United States is facing an \"invasion\" by the Tren de Aragua gang and that he has the authority to use the 1798 law. The act was last invoked during World War II, including in Colorado, to hold Japanese Americans at internment camps, including Camp Amache.",
      "Prior to World War II, the act had only been used against the Central Powers during World War I and against the British during the War of 1812.",
      "\"If you think of internment camps during World War II in the United States, that's the kind of framework that we're looking at in terms of how this law has been used in the past,\" Laura Lunn, an immigrant advocacy lawyer with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said.",
      "The legal battle has triggered a series of emergency filings over the weekend after the Supreme Court bumped a case out of U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., saying it needed to be filed in Texas and other states from which people are being deported.",
      "Asked about why this case matters, Macdonald said, \"if the government can remove these folks without due process, it erodes civil liberties for every one of us, and they could be next. We could be next. If the government is able to dispense with due process, it's a risk for liberty for all of us.\"",

      "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post\u00a0on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"",
      "The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell\u00a0is an option.",
      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",
      "The White House declined further comment.",
      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump and first lady Melania Trump hosted the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday, an annual tradition, although this year's celebration is being held only hours after Pope Francis died at age 88.",
      "Mr. Trump honored the pope in brief remarks, calling him \"a good man.\" Mr. Trump said he ordered flags to be flown half-staff to honor the late pontiff.",
      "Instead of candy-filled plastic Easter eggs, nearly 30,000 real eggs are adorning the White House South Lawn, despite record-high egg prices.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday complimented the National Park Service for decorating the White House lawn, calling it \"beautiful and spiffy.\"",
      "Much of this year's egg roll event is sponsored by corporations, a change from the traditional sponsorship by the American Egg Board. The event has traditionally been sponsored by the American Egg Board, partly to keep company advertising off White House grounds.",
      "Sponsors who shell out for $200,000 will receive a \"custom 30'x30' branded activation\" and four tickets to the WHEER brunch with the first lady and a choice of a meet and greet or White House tour. Packages are also available for $125,000 and $75,000.",
      "Companies including Amazon, YouTube and Meta are sponsoring various stations for the event. Events company Harbinger prepared a 9-page brochure for prospective sponsors. It offers sponsors \"media and PR exposure\" in front of the White House press corps on the South Lawn.",
      "This year's theme looks forward to the upcoming 250th anniversary of the nation's founding, and kids will have a chance to sign mini Declarations of Independence and dress up as the Founder Fathers.",
      "Aside from children whose families have political connections, children are invited through a lottery for guests from all 56 U.S. states and territories.",
      "The White House Easter Egg Roll is a longtime White House tradition. It dates back to 1878, when then-President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House South Lawn to children who usually rolled eggs along the Capitol's grounds. As the White House puts it, Easter Monday celebrations\u00a0became so popular in the 1870s that President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill banning rolling eggs on Capitol grounds over landscape concerns.",
      "What became an annual egg roll on the White House South Lawn was paused during World War I and World War II. But President Dwight D. Eisenhower reinstated the tradition in 1953.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-affordable-care-acts-preventive-care-prep-cancer-screenings/",
    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",

    "story": [
      "Don Pettit, NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday with two cosmonaut crewmates overnight Saturday, undocking from the International Space Station and plunging back to Earth in a blaze of re-entry heat to close out a 220-day expedition.",
      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

    "summary": "Companies say fake job seekers are using artificial intelligence to get remote jobs, often in an attempt to steal insider secrets.",
    "story": [
      "Scammers are using artificial intelligence to alter their appearance and build fake profiles to apply for remote job postings, research shows.",
      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",
      "Once they're in, these fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware.",
      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "Moczadlo said when he suspected the person was using an AI filter, he asked a simple question: \"Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face?\"",
      "When they refused, Moczadlo immediately ended the interview. He explained that the software the scammer was using didn't seem sophisticated, so blocking the person's face with their hand would likely \"break\" the deepfake face filter.",
      "\"Sometimes it takes a hacker to find a hacker,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "This was the second time the company had interviewed someone who turned out to be AI-generated. Moczadlo said it completely changed the company's hiring process. Now, potential employees are flown in for a one-day, in-person interview. The company covers travel and pays for a full day of work. It believes the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.",
      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

    "summary": "The EU has hit Apple and Meta with hundreds of millions of euros in fines as it steps up enforcement of the European Union's Digital Markets Act.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to impose sweeping penalties on Google after a court ruled the tech giant is a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;",
      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

      "The table was removed and a new chair and large mirror with makeup lighting was installed, another source said.",
      "Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News, according to multiple sources. The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, and the defense secretary's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, also a former Fox producer, expressed their approval for the upgrade before it was undertaken, one of the sources said.",
      "The Defense Department spokesperson said the green room will be available to senior leaders and VIPs prior to press engagements.",
      "The new items, including a director's chair, came from existing inventories, the spokesperson said. A new countertop was constructed by facilities services staff.",
      "\"For this upgrade we were deliberately conservative and opted for several less expensive, on-hand materiel solutions,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Hegseth hasn't used the press room to brief reporters. But it has been a set for his TV appearances, including one with Fox this week in which he blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for the revelation that he sent sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat that he created.",
      "He did not deny news reports that he shared real-time operational information with family members before strikes in Yemen were carried out. He didn't explain why his wife, who is not a Defense Department employee, was in the text chat. That was the second Signal group with whom Hegseth shared planning details about the Houthi airstrikes, which took place in mid-March. The first Signal chat, a principals group which comprised top national security officials, was created by national security adviser Michael Waltz, and its existence was exposed by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the group in error by Waltz.",
      "Hegseth claims he did not disclose classified information in either of the chat groups. The Defense Department acting inspector general is reviewing his disclosures.",
      "\"We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI, on securing our southwest border, on the president's agenda, and it's going very well at the Pentagon, and I'm proud of it,\" Hegseth said Tuesday on Fox.",
      "The Pentagon restricted access to its briefing room on Feb. 21, barring reporters unless officials were speaking. Previously, press could use the room, one of the few places they could connect to Wi-Fi in the secure building, to file stories and to conduct on-camera reports.",

    "summary": "President Trump also signed an executive order to enforce laws on the books about universities disclosing large foreign gifts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order aiming to change the college accreditation process so colleges are accredited based on \"results,\" with the president wondering aloud about looking into the math capabilities of students admitted to Harvard University and Yale University.",
      "The president also signed an order to enforce laws on the books requiring universities to disclose when they accept large foreign gifts, with one of Mr. Trump's top aides specifically calling out Harvard as a school they believe has violated the law. Federal law requires higher education institutions that receive federal funds to disclose any gifts or contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year, and some in Congress are trying to lower that threshold to $50,000.",
      "The new executive orders come as the president has singled out Harvard University. His administration has frozen billions in federal funding to Harvard, demanded sweeping changes to school policies and suggested it should lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Colleges and universities are accredited to ensure they meet basic standards by third-party entities, not the federal government, though the Department of Education decides which accrediting agencies to recognize. The accreditation process has broad implications since the government uses it to\u00a0determine which schools are allowed to participate in federal student aid programs, which distribute billions in student loans and grants.",
      "The executive order directs the Department of Education to \"hold accountable\" any college accreditors that \"fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law\" \u2014 including by terminating or suspending the accreditors' federal recognition. It specifically singles out accrediting agencies that require schools to \"engage in unlawful discrimination ... under the guise of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives.\" The order also says the Department of Education should start recognizing new college accreditors.",
      "The Trump administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on \"woke ideology\" instead of results, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said. The executive order Mr. Trump signed affects law schools and graduate programs as well.",
      "\"The basic idea is to force accreditation to be focused on the merit and the actual results that these universities are providing, as opposed to how woke these universities have gotten,\" Scharf said ahead of Mr. Trump signing the executive order. \"So we're setting up new accreditation pathways, we're charging the Department of Education to really look holistically at this accreditation mess and hopefully make it much better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wanted to know if the executive order he was signing will \"look into\" people who he says go to prestigious schools like Harvard or Princeton but can't do basic math.",
      "\"Will we look into the past people that they've taken?\" Mr. Trump asked Scharf. \"For instance, I hear all about certain great schools. And then we read where they're going to teach people basic math, math that we can all do very easily, but they can't do there.\"",
      "\"When universities are not performing appropriately, whether that's in admission or whether that's in their actual instructional activities, that's certainly something that accreditors should be considering that right now we believe they're not doing a good enough job of,\" Scharf responded.",
      "The president also signed an executive order charging federal departments and agencies to make sure universities are following the law in disclosing the acceptance of large foreign gifts.",
      "\"We believe that certain universities, including, for example, Harvard, have routinely violated this law and this law has not been effectively enforced,\" Scharf said. \"So this executive order charges your departments and agencies with enforcing the laws on the books with respect to foreign gifts to American universities.\"",
      "Scharf didn't offer evidence or details on how Harvard has allegedly violated the foreign gift disclosure law. CBS News has reached out to Harvard for comment.",
      "Harvard University on Monday announced it filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Several other schools, including Columbia University, have faced similar funding freezes, with the Trump administration alleging the schools have responded inadequately to antisemitism.",
      "The president on Wednesday also signed executive actions to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), make sure schoolchildren are adequately trained in artificial intelligence, boost apprenticeships and allow educators to enforce school discipline policies.",

      "Their study, which was published Wednesday in \"Nature,\" presents a peer-reviewed method for tying emissions to specific climate harms. Their goal is to help hold companies liable for the cost of extreme weather, similar to holding the tobacco industry liable for lung cancer cases or pharmaceutical companies liable for the opioid crisis.",
      "The research firm Zero Carbon Analytics counts 68 lawsuits filed globally about climate change damage, with more than half of them in the United States.",
      "\"We argue that the scientific case for climate liability is closed,\" wrote the study's authors, Christopher Callahan, who received his PhD from Dartmouth College, and Justin Mankin, a Dartmouth Department of Geography professor.",

      "BP: $1.45 \u2009trillion",
      "The researchers figured that every 1% of greenhouse gas put into the atmosphere since 1990 has caused $502 billion in damage from heat alone, which doesn't include the costs incurred by other extreme weather such as hurricanes, droughts and floods. Emissions data is taken from the public Carbon Majors database, they said.",
      "They used 1,000 different computer simulations to translate those emissions into changes for Earth's global average surface temperature by comparing it to a world without that company's emissions.",
      "Using this approach, they determined that pollution from Chevron, for example, has raised the Earth's temperature by .045 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "The researchers also calculated how much each company's pollution contributed to the five hottest days of the year using 80 more computer simulations and then applying a formula that connects extreme heat intensity to changes in economic output.",
      "This system is modeled on the established techniques scientists have been using for more than a decade to attribute extreme weather events, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, to climate change.",
      "Mankin said that in the past, there was an argument of, \"Who's to say that it's my molecule of CO2 that's contributed to these damages versus any other one?\" He said the study \"really laid clear how the veil of plausible deniability doesn't exist anymore scientifically. We can actually trace harms back to major emitters.\"",
      "Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and BP did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"All methods they use are quite robust,\" said Imperial College London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads World Weather Attribution, a collection of scientists who try rapid attribution studies to see if specific extreme weather events are worsened by climate change and, if so, by how much. She didn't take part in the study.",
      "\"It would be good in my view if this approach would be taken up more by different groups. As with event attribution, the more groups do it, the better the science gets and the better we know what makes a difference and what does not,\" Otto said. So far, no climate liability lawsuit against a major carbon emitter has been successful, but maybe showing \"how overwhelmingly strong the scientific evidence\" is can change that, she said.",
      "The research is a good exercise and proof of concept, but there are so many other climate variables that the numbers that Callahan and Mankin came up with are probably a vast underestimate of the damage the companies have really caused, said Michael Mann, a University of Pennsylvania climate scientist who wasn't involved in the study.",

      "\"Part of what you're seeing with the praise for Senator Durbin, not to suggest at all that it's not authentic, but it's also seeking his blessing,\" he said. \"I don't know that he would come forward with a specific endorsement. Certainly not this early in a race, he wouldn't, but anybody who runs would love to have him alongside them on the campaign trail.\"",

    "summary": "Gang experts and researchers said that while tattoos could carry gang-related meaning, they aren't enough to prove gang membership.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has repeatedly shared an image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos in an effort to link the Maryland man, who was mistakenly deported\u00a0to El Salvador on March 15, to the notorious MS-13 gang.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump again shared a photo of Abrego Garcia's left hand on social media, alleging he \"had 'MS-13' tattooed onto his knuckles.\" The image shows the characters \"M,\" \"S,\" \"1\" and \"3\" digitally added above Abrego Garcia's existing tattoos \u2014 a leaf, a smiley face, a cross and a skull \u2014 along with labels describing each symbol beneath.",
      "Many people online recognized the labels as digitally added, but some alleged they were designed to appear as part of Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos and accused the Trump administration of trying to mislead the public. The White House has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the image and who added the labels.",
      "The experts and researchers we spoke with acknowledged the tattoos could carry gang-related symbolism, but they said the markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership. They also cast doubt on Trump's claims that the marijuana leaf represents an \"M,\" the smiley face \"S,\" the cross \"1\" and the skull \"3.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "He was deported and sent to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, designed to hold the most dangerous gang members, before being moved to another facility as his case attracted widespread attention. As legal efforts to bring him back to the U.S. continue, the Trump administration has cited Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos as evidence of alleged MS-13 affiliation.",
      "Roberto Lovato, an assistant professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose memoir chronicled growing up in California during MS-13's early years, said although symbols are \"notoriously difficult to interpret,\" he does not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos are suggestive of MS-13 membership.",
      "Lovato also said current gang members he has spoken to do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos represent MS-13.",
      "Maya Barak, an associate professor of criminal justice studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told CBS News that tattoos such as devil horns, the letters \"M\" and \"S\" and the numbers \"1\" and \"3\" have been used by MS-13 members. The National Gang Center and FBI both cited variations of \"MS,\" \"13\" and devil horns as tattoos associated with MS-13.",
      "A community activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told CBS News he has worked with gang members for more than 25 years and has never seen a series of finger tattoos like Abrego Garcia's linked to MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration's \"border czar\" Tom Homan told ABC News \"you can't ignore a tattoo\" but said people are not being labeled as gang members strictly based on their tattoos.",
      "\"It's based on a lot of other things, but tattoos, one of many. But no one's removed just because of a tattoo,\" Homan said on ABC's \"This Week.\"",
      "Difficulties accurately identifying gang members",
      "Days before Mr. Trump shared the photo, other X accounts posted the same interpretation of Abrego Garcia's tattoos, garnering hundreds of thousands of views.",
      "David Kennedy, a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said identifying someone as a gang member is not a simple process and often requires a multi-pronged approach.",
      "\"I'm not aware of any statutory framework that relies just on tattoos or honestly on any one single aspect,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Lovato agreed that using the tattoos alone as evidence \"would not hold water in a court of law.\"",
      "Kennedy also noted the transient nature of gang membership as another hurdle to identifying active members.",
      "\"Even if we take the tattoos to be indicative of MS-13 membership, that's very often not a permanent status and people stop being involved [in the gang],\" Kennedy said.",
      "Maya Barak co-authored a report that highlighted the potential for mislabeling people as MS-13 members based on their perceived race or immigration status as well as their style of dress and tattoos.",
      "Multiple experts pointed out that some symbols used by gangs \u2014 such as devils or skulls \u2014 are also frequently used by the general population.",
      "\"As with other gang subcultures in the U.S., MS-13 gang culture has been somewhat commodified and become part of popular culture,\" Barak said.",

      "Scammers are using artificial intelligence to alter their appearance and build fake profiles to apply for remote job postings, research shows.",
      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",
      "Once they're in, these fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware.",
      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "Moczadlo said when he suspected the person was using an AI filter, he asked a simple question: \"Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face?\"",
      "When they refused, Moczadlo immediately ended the interview. He explained that the software the scammer was using didn't seem sophisticated, so blocking the person's face with their hand would likely \"break\" the deepfake face filter.",
      "\"Sometimes it takes a hacker to find a hacker,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "This was the second time the company had interviewed someone who turned out to be AI-generated. Moczadlo said it completely changed the company's hiring process. Now, potential employees are flown in for a one-day, in-person interview. The company covers travel and pays for a full day of work. It believes the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.",
      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

    "story": [
      "More images from an iconic U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that was sunk in the Pacific Ocean during World War II have been released, just days after a crew said they found a military vehicle inside the ship.",
      "NOAA Ocean Exploration sent a remotely operated camera inside the USS Yorktown on April 19 and 20, the agency said in a news release. The 806-foot-long aircraft carrier, nicknamed the \"Fighting Lady,\" played a huge role in the United States' Pacific campaign during World War II before it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine during the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The mission was the first to focus on the ship's hanger deck.",
      "The most surprising find was the first-ever discovery of underwater aircraft that had flown on the Midway battlefield, NOAA said. Previous missions have investigated ships that took part in the battle, but the dive on April 20 found aircraft that had engaged in the air and sea battle.",
      "At least three Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers were found on the hanger deck. One plane was still fully armed, with a bomb secured in its release cradle. This plane was likely part of a reserve force, NOAA said.",
      "The other two planes were battle-damaged. They are believed to be part of the USS Enterprise's bombing squadron, which landed aboard the USS Yorktown after a successful attack on a Japanese carrier ship. Records show that the badly damaged airplanes were moved to the hangar deck and set ablaze when three enemy bombs struck the USS Yorktown, NOAA said. Research to confirm the planes is ongoing.",
      "The remotely operated camera also identified multiple plane wings in the hangar deck. These were likely spare parts, NOAA said. One of the plane wings had first been imaged during a 2023 expedition.",
      "Another discovery showcased in the new images is a mural hand-painted inside one of the ship's elevator shafts.",
      "The mural, \"A Chart of the Cruises of the USS Yorktown,\" had been partially visible in historic photographs taken before the ship's sinking, but has not been seen since. The 42-foot by 12-foot mural tracks the Yorktown's trips across the world.",
      "The remotely operated camera was able to show the intricate details painted in the mural.",
      "NOAA also found marine life in the shipwreck, including colorful red jellyfish that may be members of a new species. Tubeworms and anemones were also spotted.",
      "The USS Yorktown wreck is protected and managed by the Naval History and Heritage Command, NOAA said. It serves as a resting place for hundreds of servicemen who were aboard the ship when it sank. It has been the site of multiple remotely operated vehicle dives since it was discovered and documented in 1998.",
      "More than 3,400 people were killed in the Battle of Midway. Three hundred and sixty-two U.S. troops died, according to the\u00a0National WWII Museum, and the vast majority of the casualties were Japanese service members. Japanese forces lost four aircraft carriers, one cruiser and hundreds of aircraft, while the U.S. lost one carrier, one destroyer and dozens of aircraft.",

    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race among Democrats in the Senate for his leadership position.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race for his long-held seat representing Illinois \u2014 and a broader shakeup of Democratic leadership in the Senate.",
      "Durbin, 80, has served since 2005 as the Democratic whip, the second-ranking position in Democratic leadership. First under former Democratic leader Harry Reid and now under Chuck Schumer, the Illinois Democrat has shepherded the caucus through votes, while being a prominent voice on the leadership team for two decades.",
      "After the 2026 elections, the whip position will be up for grabs. And the announcement has spurred whispers about a possible successor.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz's name has been floated as being among the list of Democrats who could take up the mantle. Schatz has represented Hawaii in the Senate since 2012, and currently serves as chief deputy whip. Schatz celebrated Durbin's career in a statement Wednesday, calling the Illinois Democrat a \"mentor and friend.\"",
      "Other members of the Senate Democratic leadership could also vie for the No. 2 post. The caucus elevated Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to the No. 3 position in Senate leadership in the last internal elections, along with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to the fourth-ranking post. Both are possible candidates for the whip role, though they each sought the Democratic nomination for the White House in 2020, and could have ambitions beyond the Senate in 2028. The caucus conducts leadership elections behind closed doors before the start of each new Congress.",
      "Durbin's retirement also opens up the coveted top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he's been the top Democrat since 2021. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, is widely expected to take his place at the top of the panel.",
      "The Illinois Democrat's announcement of his planned departure comes months after the bruising 2024 election, where Democrats lost power in the White House and the Senate \u2014 leading some members of the party to call for a new generation of leadership to come forward. And a broader shakeup remains possible, especially as questions about Schumer's leadership have continued to swirl, though they've died down considerably in recent weeks.",
      "Facing the threat of a government shutdown in March, Schumer, who's led the caucus since 2017, delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel a GOP-led funding measure to passage after he had initially pledged to oppose it. The move prompted intense frustration among his party, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision, arguing that a shutdown would have been worse than the funding measure for the nation, delivering sole power to the executive branch.",
      "Democrats had widely opposed the measure and expressed frustration with its spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. Some progressives suggested that a shutdown was a better alternative, while others simply took issue with Schumer's changing stance. But in the end, nine Democrats and independents also voted to advance the measure, including Schumer's No. 2, Durbin \u2014 and Schatz.",
      "As attention is now turning to Senate Democratic leadership, Senate Republicans elected a new slate after the 2024 elections, tapping Sen. John Thune to lead the conference after Sen. Mitch McConnell opted to step down after 17 years at the helm.",

Her husband, Brian Fanion, a Westfield Police detective, had called 911, reporting that Amy Fanion had shot herself.",
      "At the scene, detectives made several discoveries that raised questions. The gun used in the shooting was Brian Fanion's service weapon. And there was a lack of gunshot residue on Amy's head, which was unusual in a self-inflicted gunshot wound. What had happened in that dining room that morning? \"48 Hours\" contributor Nikki Battiste takes a look at the evidence in an encore of \u00a0\"The Detective's Wife\"\u00a0airing Saturday, April 26 on CBS and streaming on Paramount +.",
      "Detective Brendan O'Toole took Brian Fanion to the State Police barracks in Russell, Massachusetts, to get his statement of the events surrounding his wife's sudden death. At the end of the interview, \u00a0O'Toole asked Fanion to turn over his phone for data extraction. Fanion complied but gave a caveat.",
      "\"I turned off the recorder and that's when Brian told me \u2026 'you're going to see some things on there and it's not what it appears to be,'\" O'Toole told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Investigators would discover thousands of deleted text messages between Brian Fanion and a woman named Corrine Knowles, known as Cori. Brian Fanion had told O'Toole he and Knowles were just friends, but the text messages conveyed that the relationship had become something more.",
      "On May 17, three days after Amy Fanion's wake, O'Toole and Detective Mike Blanchette confronted Brian Fanion about his relationship with Knowles as well as the lack of gunshot residue found on Amy Fanion's wound.",
      "\"I mean, there's no doubt she was shot \u2026 but the question is, from what distance,\" O'Toole asked Fanion.",
      "Within a week, investigators seized all of Fanion's electronics, including his office computer and laptop at the Westfield Police Department. When Detective Tom Forest from the Cyber Crime Unit examined the computer's hard drive, it revealed peculiar web searches and online activity he considered notable to the investigation. The online activity began about three months before Amy Fanion's death, around the time Brian Fanion and Knowles' friendship turned flirtatious.",
      "\"\u2026 it's only when this affair starts up \u2026 that all of these incriminating searches start to appear,\" Hampden County Assistant District Attorney Mary Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "The first of these inquiries was related to common household poisons. On the morning of Feb. 12, Brian Fanion searched \"household poisons,\" \"dangerous sources of radiation,\" \"worst sources of radiation\" and \"common prescription overdoses.\" He also visited web pages titled, \"9 Surprising Sources of Radiation in Your Home;\" \"Carbon Monoxide: The Invisible Killer;\" \"Common and dangerous poisons;\" \"16 Common Household Items That Could Kill You;\" \"What Over-the-Counter Medications Can You Overdose From?;\" \"Which Drug Causes the Most Deaths Each Year?\" and, finally, \"Prescription Drugs Linked to Most Fatal Overdoses.\"",
      "At trial, Brian Fanion's defense attorney Jeffrey Brown argued that the Fanions were preparing to have a young niece stay with them and that some of the websites were related to potential hazards their 200-year-old house might pose.",
      "At the beginning of March 2018, Fanion repeatedly Googled his potential lover, Cori Knowles. On April 2, as things heated up between Fanion and Knowles, he began questioning the nuances of affairs, searching \"can you have an affair without sex.\"",
      "Two weeks later, on April 17, Fanion began researching divorce laws in Massachusetts. Several web pages he visited were related to pension rights after divorce. Fanion was planning for his upcoming retirement, and according to Knowles in an interview with police, he feared losing part of his pension if he were to divorce his wife. The following day, Brian Fanion's inquiries into infidelity resumed, visiting web pages titled \"My perfect affair \u2013 how I'm getting away with it\" and \"Emotional Infidelity: Worse Than A Sexual Affair?\"",
      "Eleven days before Amy Fanion died, on April 27, Brian Fanion searched \"gsr testing\" on his work computer. That morning between 9:22 and 9:38 a.m., Brian Fanion visited five web pages related to gunshot residue. Among those web pages were \"Gunshot Residue Collection: The Decisions that Make or Break a Case\" and a news report on YouTube called \"What gunshot residue tests tell us.\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours\" this had nothing to do with Brian Fanion's work at the Westfield Police Department.",
      "\"He wasn't assigned to any active investigations in April and May of 2018 \u2026 that would necessitate looking up gunshot residue,\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\" \"Nobody in the Westfield Police Department does gunshot residue testing.\"",
      "On May 7, 2018, the day before Amy Fanion was shot dead, Fanion repeatedly searched how to remove frequent contacts from his phone. At his trial, Fanion's defense argued that he was in the process of getting a new phone and wanted to know how to erase data from his current one. Sandstrom prosecuted the case.",
      "\"Now, the defendant suggests that he did these searches because he's in the process of getting a new phone right before his wife's demise,\" Sandstrom told the jury. \"But he's not looking to delete all data off of his phone \u2026 he's searching how to delete the frequently contacted list because he doesn't want evidence of his relationship with Corrine being discovered by the state police.\"",
      "Fanion's trial for the murder of Amy Fanion began on Feb. 23, 2023. Sandstrom's first witness was Amy Fanion's sister, Anna Hansen. Hansen testified that after Amy's death, Brian Fanion confided that he was concerned about some searches he had made.",
      "\"I asked him what that search was, and he said how to make a murder look like a suicide,\" Hansen said on the witness stand. Under cross examination by the defense, Detective Tom Forest testified that he never found any searches related to those terms.",
      "On the morning of May 8, 2018, while Brian Fanion was still at work, he searched \"massachusetts medical examiner offices\" and visited a website that listed the units within the Massachusetts State Police forensics section.",
      "In her closing arguments, Sandstrom stated that that morning, Brian Fanion was preparing for his wife's murder. \"He's looking up and researching the units that will appear \u2026 after he's committed this murder. \u2026 the evidence in this case proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was going to murder Amy Fanion when he left the Westfield Police Department at 11:47 a.m. on May 8th.\"",
      "Brian Fanion's defense argued that Amy Fanion had anger issues and suffered from severe anxiety. After Amy's death, many members of her family signed a letter in support of Brian, stating that they were certain Amy had taken her own life. Several members of Amy Fanion's family took the stand, and although they were called as witnesses for the prosecution, their testimonies supported Brian Fanion's defense.",

    "story": [
      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",
      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

I took a life so mine was forfeited. I don't believe in sitting here and wasting everybody's time and everybody's money.\"",

      "After Osgood was convicted in 2014 and sentenced to death, an appeals court threw out the sentence, ruling that a judge gave improper instructions to jurors. But as a new sentencing hearing began, Osgood asked for another death sentence.",
      "\"I knew they were going to come back with death. I didn't want her family and my family to relive all that, just for the same thing. Why put them through that?\"",
      "Osgood has struggled to explain what he did. He said he had been drinking for 36 to 48 hours before the crime, but he said alcohol was not to blame for what he did. Asked what he would say to young people, Osgood said it would be don't do anything to someone they wouldn't want done to themselves.",

    "summary": "Federal health officials want companies to swap out certain food dyes with natural alternatives.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is asking the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes, in a bid to fulfill one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals to swap them out with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",
      "Makary said he had had \"wonderful meetings with the food industry\" and claimed that they are eager to remove artificial dyes from the food supply.",
      "\"They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this,\" Makary said.",
      "HHS says the FDA will be \"working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes\" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.",
      "Response from the food industry",
      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to products supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had nearly 20 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 30 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Twelve states and the District of Columbia reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.",

      "The New York Times reported earlier this month that CBS News' parent company, Paramount, and Mr. Trump's legal team had selected a mediator to try to reach a settlement.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:24:36 -0400",
    "summary": "A Maryland school board decided to end parental opt-outs for instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation, sparking the dispute that's before the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A sharply divided Supreme Court appeared likely to require a Maryland school board provide parents with the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "After more than two hours of arguments, the court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who lives in Montgomery County, Maryland, invoked the state's founding and said the county in particular has been a \"beacon\" of religious liberty and tolerance. He told Alan Schoenfeld, who argued for the school board, he was \"surprised\" given that history that \"this is the hill we're going to die on in terms of not respecting religious liberty.\"",
      "\"What is the big deal about allowing them to opt-out of this?\" Justice Samuel Alito asked, noting that the county allows parents to request their children be excused from other areas of instruction, such as sexual education or Halloween or Valentine's Day celebrations. \"What is infeasible about doing that?\"",
      "Kavanaugh echoed Alito, saying, \"I'm not understanding why it's not feasible\" for schools to excuse children from instruction that violate their families' religious beliefs.",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "Several of the justices acknowledged that they had read the picture books that were included in the curriculum, and Alito at one point even read from one, \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" which discusses gay marriage.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "Eric Baxter, who argued on behalf of the families, told the justices that Montgomery County is an \"extreme outlier\" for declining to allow parents to excuse their children despite their religious objections to the content. He said the instruction featuring the books with LGBTQ-themes was \"clearly indoctrinating\" students.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raised the comments, and asked Shoenfeld if they \"suggest a hostility toward religion.\"",
      "Shoenfeld said the remarks were taken out of context but acknowledged they were \"intemperate.\"",
      "Kavanaugh said that as a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he was \"mystified\" by what led the county to eventually end the opt-outs, and said it \"stands alone\" both with the types of books added to the curriculum for young students and in not allowing parents to opt their children out of the instruction.",
      "The school system has said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice. Schoenfeld told the justices that the books sought to \"foster mutual respect in a pluralistic community.\"",
      "It was unclear whether the court would adopt a firm rule that specifies when certain public-school instruction crosses the line from mere exposure to objectionable content into impermissible coercion of students. The justices raised several examples to discern the point at which the right to free exercise of religion would be burdened.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether a parent could request an opt-out for their child whose teacher shows photos from their same-sex wedding or talks about it, or whether a teacher would have to notify a parent if their child had a transgender classmate.",
      "\"This is not just about books,\" she said. \"This is about exposure to people of different sexual orientations and the objection, the sincerely held objection, that children shouldn't be exposed to this?\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Baxter on whether the families were objecting to the \"exposure to the ideas\" portrayed in the books and asked whether they would be pursuing their claim if the storybooks were just on the shelf at the library, rather than incorporated into instruction.",
      "Baxter said his clients would be making the same claim based on their religious beliefs if the picturebooks were just on the shelves.",
      "The school board has warned that accepting the parents' argument that the no-opt-out policy burdened their religious exercise could have harmful effects for public education as a whole.",
      "\"Crediting petitioners' burden theory would not only contravene constitutional text, history, and precedent, but also \u2014 as courts have long recognized \u2014 'leave public education in shreds' by entitling parents to pick and choose which aspects of the curriculum will be taught to their children,\" they wrote in court papers.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union also said that under the parents' assertions, public school families could request exemptions from an array of curricular requirements because of their religious beliefs, including objecting to lessons on major historical figures who are LGBTQ.",
      "\"In sum, requiring public schools to exempt students from secular instruction that they or their parents may find objectionable for religious reasons could throw public schools into disarray, effectively 4 forcing them to tailor their educational materials to align with the religious beliefs of individual students and/or their parents,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by early July.",

The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",

    "summary": "JD Vance says both Ukraine and Russia will \"have to give up some of the territory they currently own\" to end the war, or the U.S. will \"walk away\" from peace efforts.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance warned Wednesday that Moscow and Kyiv must strike a deal or Washington will end its efforts to reach a ceasefire. It was the second warning from the Trump administration in less than a week, despite President Trump's frequent pledges before his second term began that he would end the war immediately.",
      "\"We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance told reporters in India, where he is on a four-day visit.",
      "Vance spoke as envoys from Washington, Kyiv and European nations gathered for talks in the U.K. amid a new U.S. push to end Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "\"It's now time, I think, to take, if not the final step, one of the final steps, which is, at a broad level, the party saying we're going to stop the killing, we're going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today,\" Vance added. \"Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, President Trump posted on Truth Social to blast Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for saying Ukraine will not recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea.",
      "\"This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia in that Crimea was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama, and is not even a point of discussion,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired? ... The statement made by Zelenskyy today will do nothing but prolong the 'killing field,' and nobody wants that! We are very close to a Deal, but the man with \"no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE.\"",
      "\"Enough is enough. The president's frustrated, his patience is running very thin,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the White House Wednesday.",
      "Seemingly in response to Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy reposted on social media a 2018 statement from Mr. Trump's former Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, in which Pompeo said, \"the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.\"",
      "Emotions have run high today. But it is good that 5 countries met to bring peace closer. Ukraine, the USA, the UK, France and Germany. The sides expressed their views and respectfully received each other\u2019s positions. It\u2019s important that each side was not just a participant but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lDFV5WK8tw",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that his country was ready for any negotiations that might bring about a ceasefire, as he sent his condolences to the families of nine civilians killed in a Russian drone attack on a bus earlier in the day.",
      "\"We insist on an immediate, complete and unconditional ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. \"Stopping the killing is the number one task. I am grateful to everyone who is focused on this and helping to move towards the end of the war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail to strike a deal between Moscow and Kyiv in 24 hours, but has since failed to secure concessions from President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump proposed an unconditional ceasefire in March, the principle of which was accepted by Kyiv but rejected by Putin.",
      "The White House welcomed a separate agreement by both sides to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days, but the Kremlin has said it considers that moratorium to have expired.",
      "The remarks from Trump and Vance came as senior officials from the U.S., France, the U.K., Germany and Ukraine were holding talks in London aimed at securing a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio pulled out of higher-level talks that had been scheduled, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Rubio said he had spoken to his British counterpart, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, on Tuesday night, calling the conversation \"productive.\" He said the U.S. delegation to London was being led by Special Presidential Envoy Keith Kellogg.",
      "\"I look forward to following up after the ongoing discussions in London and rescheduling my trip to the U.K. in the coming months,\" Rubio said.",
      "Lammy also called the conversation with Rubio \"productive,\" and said \"the U.K. is working with the U.S., Ukraine and Europe for peace and to put an end to Putin's illegal invasion.

    "summary": "France, Germany and Britain meanwhile said Israel's seven-week blockade on all imports to Gaza was \"intolerable.\"",
    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 An overnight Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City killed at least 10 people and injured dozens of others, according to the Gaza health ministry run by Hamas. The strike came as officials said Arab mediators worked on a proposal to end the war with Hamas that would include a five-to-seven-year truce and the release of all remaining hostages.",
      "There was no immediate Israeli comment on the strike, which set several tents ablaze, burning people alive. The Israel Defense Forces says it only targets militants, and it blames all civilian deaths on Hamas, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group that Israel accuses of positioning fighters and weapons in densely populated areas.",
      "Another six people were killed in separate strikes, including 5-year-old twin girls, health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory said.",
      "France, Germany and Britain meanwhile said Israel's seven-week blockade on all imports to Gaza, including food, was \"intolerable,\" in unusually strong criticism from three of the country's closest allies.",
      "Egypt and Qatar are still developing the latest peace proposal, which would include the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners, according to an Egyptian official and a Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month and has vowed to continue the war until all hostages are returned and Hamas is destroyed or disarmed and sent into exile. It says it will hold parts of Gaza indefinitely and implement President Trump's proposal for the resettlement of the population in other countries, which has been widely rejected internationally.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the dozens of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners, a complete Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire, as called for in the now-defunct agreement reached in January. A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo late Tuesday to discuss the evolving proposal.",
      "In a seeming bid to increase pressure on Israel, where regular protests have seen hostage family members and others demand that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu make a deal to bring home the remaining captives, Hamas released a video on Wednesday purportedly showing one of the surviving hostages appeal for help.",
      "The three-minute video posted online by Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, shows a man who identifies himself as 48-year-old Omri Miran, an Israeli-Hungarian hostage, addressing the camera directly and acknowledging the protests in Israel. He says he and the other surviving hostages, of whom Israel believes there are 24, live in constant fear amid their own country's ongoing bombing of Gaza, and he calls for an agreement to be struck as quickly as possible for their release.",
      "Hamas has released a series of similar undated hostage videos, showing captives making appeals that have clearly been recorded under duress.",
      "The Egyptian official said the latest proposed truce would include international guarantees and would last between five and seven years, and that a committee of politically independent technocrats would govern Gaza during that time \u2013 a measure Hamas has accepted.",
      "The Hamas official who provided The Associated Press with the rough details of the proposal said the group was open to a long-term truce that includes the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and international guarantees, naming Russia, China, Turkey or the United Nations Security Council as possible guarantors.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials. Israel has ruled out any arrangement that would allow Hamas to preserve its influence in Gaza and rearm. The Trump administration, which has also been involved in the ceasefire talks, has said it fully supports Israel's position.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have pressed Hamas to accept a temporary truce in which it would immediately release several hostages in return for promises of talks on a more permanent ceasefire. Hamas has rejected those proposals and says it won't disarm as long as Israel occupies Palestinian territory.",
      "The Hamas official said the group does not trust Netanyahu or the U.S. after they shattered the last ceasefire agreement, which had facilitated the release of over 30 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The Egyptian official said mediators had the impression that Mr. Trump wants a deal before he visits the region next month. Mr. Trump will travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates from May 13-16.",
      "Israel ended the last ceasefire by launching a surprise bombardment across the territory that killed hundreds of Palestinians. IDF ground forces have since expanded a buffer zone along the border and encircled the southern city of Rafah, leaving them in control of around 50% of the narrow, densely populated territory.",
      "Israel says the military operations and the tightened blockade are tactics to pressure Hamas to release hostages. Aid groups say thousands of children are malnourished and most people are surviving on one meal a day or less.",
      "\"The Israeli decision to block aid from entering Gaza is intolerable,\" France, Germany and Britain said in their statement. They also condemned recent remarks by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, who said the blockade was a pressure tactic and that troops would hold parts of Gaza indefinitely.",
      "\"Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change. Israel is bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid,\" the European statement said.",
      "Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein rejected the criticism, disputing in a post on social media that there is any shortage of aid in Gaza. He claims Hamas seizes it for its own use, adding that Israel was entitled to block the aid.",
      "In addition to the strike on the school, the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, said it recovered four bodies from strikes on two homes in the same area. Another strike hit a home east of Gaza City, killing the twin girls, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. The militants still have 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",

      "Army Cpl. Albert J. Estrada was a member of Battery B, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 31st Regimental Combat Team, 7th Infantry Division, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. He began service in July 1950, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation. He was one of tens of thousands of soldiers present at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November and December 1950, the DPAA said.",
      "During the battle, 30,000 United Nations servicemembers, including U.S. soldiers, faced off against 120,000 Chinese and North Korean enemy forces in \"rugged terrain in lethally cold weather,\" the DPAA said. The battle, which the DPAA described as \"one of the most brutal\" of the entire war, raged for 17 days.",
      "Army officials wanted to push North Korean forces into China and sever supply lines near the Chosin reservoir, the DPAA said. But the North Korean forces launched a surprise attack that forced one group of soldiers to retreat in late November. A few days later, Chinese soldiers surrounded and isolated another group of soldiers. A task force was hastily assembled to try to organize a withdrawal. A \"bitter fight\" allowed U.N. forces to open an airfield to bring in reinforcements and evacuate casualties on December 1, according to the U.S. military, and eventually, the U.N. soldiers managed a full retreat.",
      "More than 1,000 U.S. Marines and soldiers were killed during this time, the DPAA said. Thousands more were injured or incapacitated by the cold weather. Due to the elements and the retreat, \"hundreds of fallen Marines and soldiers were unable to be immediately recovered,\" the DPAA said.",
      "Estrada was one of the soldiers who could not be located after the battle. He was reported missing on Dec. 6, 1950. There was no information to indicate that he was ever held as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. Three years later, on Dec. 31, 1953, the U.S. Army issued a presumptive finding of death.",
      "Between 1953 and 1954, the North Korean government returned thousands of remains of soldiers who had died during the Korean War. The remains had been buried in U.N. cemeteries in North Korea. The effort, known as Operation Glory, included the return of 500 sets of remains that had been buried near the Chosin reservoir. All but 126 of the remains were identified. The unidentified remains were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the DPAA said.",
      "From 1990 to 1994, the North Korean government returned 47 additional containers of remains attributed to the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. From those recovery efforts, the DPAA and the organizations that preceded it were able to identify over 130 of the unaccounted-for missing personnel lost in the Chosin Reservoir Campaign.",
      "The DPAA did not say which handover Estrada's remains were recovered from. A full announcement of his accounting will be shared at a later date, the agency said.",
      "Estrada earned multiple military honors, including the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Republic of Korea War Service Medal, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation.",
      "Estrada's surviving siblings, Manuel Estrada and Ruth Tucker, have long lobbied for his identification, according to a 2018 article from The Daily Democrat. That year, Tucker was presented with a medal from the Republic of South Korea honoring her efforts to account for missing American soldiers who died during the Korean War. At the time, Tucker said complete identification of Korean War remains can take between four and five years.",

      "Francis died at 7:35 a.m. Monday at his residence, the Vatican said. In an statement released Monday, the Vatican said Francis died of a cerebral stroke, coma and subsequent irreversible heart failure.",
      "\"We don't have a lot of details,\" said CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. \"But the bottom line is, you know, he had all these underlying conditions. He had the stroke, which is [when] you have too little blood supply to the brain. That can cause death in a number of ways, including shutting down the ability\u2014 the centers in the brain that allow you to breathe normally, and even the centers that allow the heart to work correctly.\"",
      "The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, long battled health problems and was especially prone to respiratory illnesses. He was hospitalized for five weeks this winter after developing double pneumonia.",
      "In July 2021, he spent 10 days in the hospital following intestinal surgery\u00a0for a bowel narrowing. In March 2023, he was hospitalized for three days and received\u00a0intravenous antibiotics for bronchitis. A few months later, in June 2023, he was back in the hospital to have surgery to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia in the abdominal wall.",
      "Since 2022, he often used a wheelchair, walker or cane due to knee injuries, and he had suffered recently from multiple falls.",
      "Here's a breakdown of his most recent bout of health challenges earlier this year:",
      "Feb. 6, 2025: Francis was diagnosed with bronchitis, but continued to hold daily audiences \u2014 though he handed off his speeches for an aide to read aloud, saying he was having trouble breathing.",
      "Feb. 14, 2025: Francis was hospitalized to treat bronchitis and undergo diagnostic tests. A spokesperson said he was expected to be there for \"a few days.\"",
      "Feb. 17, 2025: Francis'\u00a0respiratory tract infection\u00a0presented a \"complex clinical picture\" that required further hospitalization, the Vatican said at the time. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said tests indicated the pope was suffering from a \"polymicrobial respiratory tract infection\" that called for a further change in his drug therapy.",
      "Feb. 18, 2025: Francis developed bilateral pneumonia, meaning the pneumonia was in both of his lungs. The illness was discovered after Francis underwent a chest CT scan, the Vatican said. According to the statement, Francis was in a good mood and spent the day resting, praying and reading.",
      "Feb. 23, 2025: Francis remained in critical condition as blood tests showed early kidney failure. The Vatican said he remained alert and \"well-oriented.\" While he hadn't had any more respiratory crises since the night before, he was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen.",
      "Feb. 26, 2025:\u00a0Blood tests confirmed a slight improvement in the pope's health, according to a Vatican update, and the slight kidney insufficiency detected a few days prior had receded. Francis continued to receive respiratory physiotherapy to help him expel fluid from his lungs.",
      "Feb. 28, 2025: Francis experienced a bronchospasm, which is when the muscles that line the airways in the lungs tighten. The incident caused him to inhale vomit, but he responded well to being treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, according to the Vatican.",
      "March 1, 2025:\u00a0Pope Francis had a calm night after the bronchial crisis caused a setback to his recovery. In an update, the Vatican said he had coffee, read newspapers and was able to move and sit in his armchair.",
      "March 3, 2025:\u00a0Francis suffered \"two episodes of acute respiratory failure\" over the course of the day, which the Vatican said were caused by \"significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm.\"",
      "March 8, 2025: The Vatican said Pope Francis was showing \"gradual, slight improvement\" amid his pneumonia treatment.",
      "March 10, 2025: Doctors said\u00a0Pope Francis\u00a0was no longer in imminent danger of death from pneumonia, but they decided to keep him hospitalized longer to receive treatment.",
      "March 14, 2025: Francis marked the\u00a012th anniversary of his papacy\u00a0from his hospital room. It was also the one-month mark since he was hospitalized.",
      "March 23, 2025:\u00a0After five weeks, Francis left Rome's Gemelli hospital after surviving the life-threatening bout of pneumonia.",
      "March 26, 2025: An interview with Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of Pope Francis' medical team, revealed Francis came close to dying on two separate occasions before he was allowed to return to his home at the Vatican over the weekend. Alfieri told an Italian newspaper that the medical team even considered letting the pope die at one critical point on Feb. 28 when Francis had suffered a breathing crisis after inhaling his own vomit during a coughing fit. Alfieri described it as \"the worst\" day of the pope's 38-day hospitalization.",

    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 He was a populist leader, often referred to as the \"People's Pope.\" As pontiff, Francis, who died Monday at age 88, sought to bring the Church closer to the people, stating early in his papacy that he wanted to have a poorer Church \"for the poor.\" He was known for being driven around in unflashy cars and for making folksy gestures, like taking trips into Rome to buy an item at the store.",
      "He was brilliant at playing to the press, creating the sorts of photo-ops that would draw attention to his areas of interest. He'd often speak extemporaneously while on papal voyages, particularly toward the beginning of his papacy, fielding questions on the flight.",
      "That made his papal trips a must-attend event for the press covering him. For those of us who got to travel with Pope Francis, we could see how he'd interact over the course of days with various dignitaries and his wider flock of the faithful. He'd appear particularly energized and engaged, lighting up when with children or in an audience with those who were cast aside, living on the margins of society.",
      "He died just a day after surprising many with a brief appearance in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday, blessing thousands of people and sounding stronger as he did so than he had since his release from a Rome hospital at the end of March.",
      "We wanted to look back on his papacy, his legacy, and also look forward to the next pope, so we asked veteran Vatican correspondent Francis X. Rocca to meet recently on the terrace of a convent in Rome, with a spectacular view out over St. Peter's Basilica, for a chat about Pope Francis.",
      "We look back, and ahead. Below is a partial transcript from our conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "SETH DOANE: What is Pope Francis' legacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I suppose it depends on whom you ask. I mean, for women, for example, he certainly was someone who brought women in the Vatican, and gave them higher positions than had ever been the case. It's still a relatively small number, but that was certainly a very dramatic change. For conservatives, he started by giving them heartburn and ended up by giving practically a heart attack. It was quite a dramatic confrontation. In some ways was a polarizing pope. At the same time that he really pushed the envelope and allowed things to be spoken about that had been considered closed, whether on sexual ethics, on medical ethics. \u2026 In a way, because of his very informal style of discourse, talking to journalists, giving interviews, press conferences, he seemed to give permission to people to criticize him, too, even if that wasn't his intention. So the debate became much more heated during his pontificate.",
      "SETH DOANE: Why was Pope Francis seen as such a divisive figure? Why did conservatives dislike him?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I think there were a number of reasons. One is that he had a very\u00a0 loose attitude toward tradition, let's put it that way. From the very beginning, when he stepped out on the loggia in the front of St. Peter's Basilica, and he didn't wear the red cape that was customary on that occasion \u2014 before he even said a word, already people started to get nervous, conservatives started to get nervous that he was just not going to respect tradition.",
      "And he broke it in small ways like that, but he also tested it in bigger ways. And, for example, relatively late in his pontificate, gave permission for the blessings of same-sex couples. They tried to present that as something that was consistent with tradition, but it certainly wasn't seen that way by conservatives. And especially in Africa, where basically all the bishops of sub-Saharan Africa protested and wanted a kind of exemption from this new permission, which is extraordinary. And that's just a very clear illustration how divisive things became, when you have an entire continent \u2014 a continent where the Church is growing very quickly \u2014 taking a completely different stand from other parts of the Church. That happened under Pope Francis, and it happened because he made a bold move.",
      "SETH DOANE: Conservative Catholics in America were some of his loudest critics.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yes, that's right. He had a the majority of the U.S. bishops were not on board with his priorities, I think that's pretty clear. The pope and his allies among the U.S. bishops, who are a minority, wanted to play down abortion. The pope hated abortion, but he wanted to play [it] down, with respect to social and environmental and economic issues, or at least put them on an equal plane. That's maybe the better way to put it. The U.S. bishops have for years said that opposition to abortion is their \"preeminent priority.\" And the pope and his allies didn't want that, and they weren't able to persuade the majority of U.S. bishops about that, and that became a very, very big point of tension.",
      "SETH DOANE: We traveled with the pope together. One of the things that struck me was how he was with kids \u2014 he would kind of come alive in a way.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: He was very approachable. He was very informal. That was the \u2014 one of the beguiling, charming things, charismatic things about him. His predecessors are \u2014 John Paul was a very charismatic figure, very telegenic, but he was not so relaxed. And Pope Francis had an ordinary style that appealed to people.",
      "SETH DOANE: Pope Francis was known as the \"People's Pope.\" He was known to reach out to try to pull in the masses.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah. He was also a populist pope, with a kind of political resonance. His style was very much to try to have a bond with the people, with \u2014 implicitly or sometimes not so implicitly, against the elites, in this case, the hierarchy: the bishops and the cardinals. He kind of played off of them. And he was always sort of suggesting that the elites, even the Diocesan clergy priests and parish priests, could be aloof from their people, could be too rigid, could be too attached to luxury or to privilege. And so he was always beating that drum and saying, \"No. I'm with the people.\"",
      "SETH DOANE: This pope tried to tackle sexual abuse issues within the clergy, within the Church. He tried to tackle the vast bureaucracy and economic issues in the Church. How did he do?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I \u2014 his record on sex abuse was mixed. And I think actually not up to the level that people had expected of him. He had a kind of a distaste for disciplining the priests and bishops compared with his predecessor, Pope Benedict. Pope Benedict the high water mark in terms of discipline of abusive clergy. Pope Francis stepped back a bit from that. He got in trouble for that in Chile, when he was very stubbornly supportive of a bishop who'd been accused of covering up sex abuse. He finally backed down, but it was an embarrassment.",
      "SETH DOANE: What were some of the big issues under Pope Francis' papacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, certainly a big issue was his relative leniency on questions of marriage, the family, and sexuality. The single most famous statement from his pontificate was the one he made at his very first press conference in 2013, which was, \"Who am I to judge?\" He was talking, in that case, about gay priests. But he could have been talking about divorced Catholics, whom he allowed to take communion, in many cases, which had not been the practice before. He could have been talking about Catholics who use contraception. Pope Francis didn't change teaching formally on any of these issues. But what he did was signal that it was OK to have different points of view about them, that it was not a priority \u2014 that he was not censuring anyone. And, in fact, some of his advisors here explored, for example, the possibility of relaxing the ban on contraception that had been so controversial since Pope Paul VI had reaffirmed it in 1968. So those are some issues.",
      "Another issue: He had a rapprochement with China, which was controversial, even among Chinese Catholics, where he \u2026 agreed to share responsibility for choosing Catholic bishops in China with the Communist government there. And that was controversial. He felt that it was important to have dialogue and to keep the Church unified at some level, but a lot of the Catholics who resisted government control in China resented that and felt that he was selling them out.",
      "SETH DOANE: One of the regular criticisms of this pope was that he sowed confusion. Why was that heard so often?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, he played with ambiguity. A lot of his statement were made in an informal manner at press conferences and in interviews, not in doctrinal documents that came out from the Vatican. And so therefore he, you know, when he says, \"Who am I to judge?\" \u2014 well, what does that mean? Conservatives tried very hard to read that in a way very consistent with strict tradition. And you could if you wished. But the pope was very media savvy. He knew how his comments would play. He knew how his soundbites and headlines would play, and so when he made a statement like that, he knew that most people would read that as meaning that sexual morality, or at least in that case, was a matter of conscience, that people could follow their own conscience. That's not explicitly what he said, but when he said, \"Who am I to judge?\" he seemed to be saying, \"This is a private affair, this is someone with his own conscience.\" And that's how many people read it, even if he didn't explicitly say that.",
      "SETH DOANE: During his papacy, Pope Francis changed the feeling of the Church. You saw him driving around in simple cars, sometimes going out into Rome to buy something at a store. The feeling of who a pope is changed even in where he decided to live, at the Santa Marta Hotel, and not in the Apostolic Palace.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah, that's right, even wearing, you know, ordinary black shoes, or having his Argentinian passport renewed, wearing the white skull cap in the photo. That's true: He was definitely very deliberate. He wanted to make the pope seem more with the people, and to pull down some of the barriers. And that's why he had a very tactile, approachable style. It will be interesting to see if his successor feels the need to maintain that, or will go back to something more traditional and more formal.",
      "SETH DOANE: In the long arc of the Church's history, how much will Francis' papacy really have changed?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, the long march of papal history is very long indeed. One thing is he was the first pope from the Americas, and the first pope from the Global South. So he'll always have a place in the history books for that reason. Beyond that, it depends on what happens next. I mean, if the next pope is going to carry forward his progressive approach, and if that's going to continue and change the Church, and Church teaching is going to change on things like women's ordination, you know, or homosexuality, if it's actually going to change, then he will be a historic figure in that respect. If we go back to something more traditional, then that will be a kind of an anomaly. But he will remain in the history books because of where he's from.",
      "SETH DOANE: Looking ahead to the next pope, did Pope Francis, if you will, \"stack the decks\" enough that the College of Cardinals is likely to go with a more progressive, more liberal pope? Or does the pendulum swing the other way?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, that's always the big question. Certainly Pope Francis was notable,\u00a0 and even some of his supporters acknowledge this, in not choosing people who didn't agree with him as cardinals. He tended to choose people like that. On the other hand, he chose a lot of people from far-flung regions, from places that had never had a cardinal before, about whom we know very little, and probably Pope Francis didn't know very much either. So that's a bit of a wild card. There's also the issue that cardinals tend to be pretty conservative people \u2014 \"conservative\" with a small \"c.\" They tend to want not to rock the boat too much, and Pope Francis rocked the boat continually.",
      "SETH DOANE: We could see a more conservative pope next?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Certainly it's very possible that we'll see a pope with a more conservative temperament, a more conservative governing style, a more conservative communicative style. Maybe not a hard-right conservative, in terms of doctrine, we might not get that. But we might get someone who's going to \u2014 the College of Cardinals wants to calm the waters. It's been a very turbulent period under Pope Francis, and so they might want someone who will just not speak quite so often to the press, not stir things up, not shake things up for a while. We could be looking at that.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis made it his mission to change the perception of the Catholic Church around the world.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 Pope Francis, who challenged deeply rooted norms and made it his mission to change the perception of the Catholic Church around the world, has died at the age of 88. The Vatican said Pope Francis died just after 7:30 a.m. local time on Monday, a day after he surprised many by appearing at St. Peter's Square\u00a0at the Vatican on Easter Sunday to greet well-wishers.",
      "The Vatican said in a statement later Monday that Francis died of a stroke that put him into a coma and led to irreversible heart failure.",
      "Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, formally announced the pope's death with a statement saying: \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.\"",
      "Tributes praising his leadership and devotion quickly began to pour in from around the world.",
      "Pope Francis had experienced a number of health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries and several serious\u00a0respiratory infections. He spent\u00a0five weeks\u00a0in the\u00a0hospital\u00a0in February and March 2025 with bronchitis that developed into\u00a0pneumonia\u00a0in both lungs. He marked the\u00a012th anniversary of his papacy\u00a0from his hospital room.",
      "The pontiff was pushed in a wheelchair into the room for an interview\u00a0at his Vatican residence\u00a0with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in April 2024. But while he was having difficulty walking, he spoke clearly during the\u00a0hourlong conversation\u00a0about his prayers for an end to the\u00a0wars in Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine. In more recent appearances, however, the pontiff clearly struggled for breath as he delivered planned remarks.",
      "After being elected by his fellow Catholic cardinals in 2013, he set the tone with his first official act as pope, reversing a centuries-old tradition \u2014 by simply asking for help.",
      "Normally after a new pope is elected, they come out and bless the masses gathered at St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. But when Francis was elected, he came out and first asked the faithful to bless and pray for him.",
      "\"I want to ask you a favor,\" he said. \"Before the bishop blesses the people, I ask that you would pray to the lord to bless me.\"",
      "It may seem a subtle change, but along with his familiar greeting and farewell to the crowd in Italian that day, it set the tone for his entire papacy. Pope Francis made it clear that he identified himself as a brother pilgrim, not as an imperial pope. He didn't want to keep leading a one-way monologue from the highest post in the Catholic Church, but a dialogue.",
      "As pope, the man previously known as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose to name himself after Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of Italy, known for his simplicity and humanity.",
      "The first pope from the New World, born and raised in Argentina, he said he wanted \"a poorer Church\" and one that would \"include the excluded.\"",
      "He set an example by choosing to live in Room 201 at the Santa Marta \u2014 a small Vatican hotel usually used for visiting priests \u2014 rather than in the lavish papal apartments used by his predecessors. Pope Francis carried his own bag, and walked across Rome to buy his own pair of glasses.",
      "His desire to reach out to ordinary people sent the bulletproof \"popemobiles\" into storage.",
      "\"I cannot greet people from inside a sardine can,\" he famously explained, \"even if it is made of glass.\"",
      "He became one of the most popular public figures in the world, regularly speaking up for the voiceless and leading by example \u2014 whether that was by dining with the homeless, washing inmates' feet, or providing a home in Italy for migrants and refugees fleeing war or economic instability.",
      "Pope Francis railed against consumerism and individualism, and he insisted that \"unfair economic structures\" were a violation of human rights.",
      "He also pushed for progress in combating climate change, even publishing an encyclical \u2014 a formal letter from himself to Catholic leaders around the world \u2014 on the topic. And he reformed the Curia \u2014 the central administration of the church \u2014 allowing lay men and women to run Vatican offices, positions historically reserved for cardinals and bishops.",
      "He continued to give his public prayers during the coronavirus lockdowns, but with crowds banned, \"the People's Pope\" was left to deliver his messages in an empty St. Peter's Square.",
      "Wasting no time after getting his COVID vaccine, Pope Francis made a daring, first-ever\u00a0papal visit to Iraq, despite immense security risks. In Mosul, where ISIS militants once ransacked churches, Pope Francis prayed in them.",
      "A few months later, his health finally caught up with him. He spent 10 days\u00a0in a Rome hospital\u00a0in July 2021 recovering from a scheduled surgery to remove part of his colon. It was the first time he was hospitalized after being named pope.",
      "In 2022, a torn knee ligament forced him to finally\u00a0slow down. He was using a wheelchair and canceling both Vatican celebrations and overseas trips, generating persistent rumors that Francis, like Pope Benedict XVI, would\u00a0resign. When\u00a0Benedict died, Francis\u00a0presided over\u00a0his funeral, the first time in modern history a pope has laid his predecessor to rest.",
      "Over time, Francis' papacy began to be defined by a topic he did not choose: the wave of clerical sex abuse scandals that stretched to the very highest levels of the Catholic Church. He was accused, at first, of being insensitive in his slow response to the crisis.",
      "Then he tried to take control of the narrative, notably summoning senior clerics from around the world to the Vatican in early 2019. From that meeting came new Vatican laws about sex abuse, and a mandate that every diocese set up a clear reporting process. He also abolished the top-level confidentiality of the \"pontifical secret,\" which had shrouded the sex abuse crisis in yet another layer of systemic secrecy.",
      "His diplomatic skill was on display when he\u00a0played a key role\u00a0in restoring relations between the United States and its decades-old enemy, Cuba.",
      "His' simple style was a product of his humble beginnings. He was born on Dec. 17, 1936, to an immigrant Italian railway worker and a housewife in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a young man, he lost part of a lung to an infection. He worked at various menial jobs and studied chemistry.",
      "After being ordained as a priest at the late age of 32, he made visiting the slums of Buenos Aires and caring for the city's poor a feature of his ministry.",
      "During a press conference aboard one papal flight years later, he appeared to crack open a space for homosexuals in the church, with a single, highly symbolic phrase: \"Who am I to judge?\"\u00a0he asked\u00a0when a reporter fired him a question about LGBTQ rights.",
      "But while he may have received widespread credit for changing the tone of the church when it comes to acceptance, the church's teachings and policy did not change.",
      "Despite drawing fire from Catholic conservatives for being too liberal, Pope Francis reaffirmed long-standing church doctrines\u00a0opposing same-sex marriage, and on pretty much everything else from birth control to\u00a0ordaining women.",
      "He claimed that he only brought a small bag to the papal conclave in 2013 that saw him elected, because he expected to be going back home to Argentina.",
      "Instead, neither his life, nor the papacy, were ever the same again.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis had expressed the desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a fifth-century church in Rome.",
    "story": [
      "Joanne M. Pierce\u00a0is a professor emerita of religious studies at the\u00a0College of the Holy Cross.",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff had been well aware of his fragile state and advanced age. As early as 2015, Pope Francis had expressed the desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a fifth-century church in Rome dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was so devoted to Mary and her basilica that after each of his more than 100 trips abroad, he would visit it after returning to Rome to pray and meditate.",
      "No pope has been buried in Santa Maria Maggiore since the 17th century, when Pope Clement IX was laid to rest there.",
      "I'm a specialist in Catholic liturgical history. In earlier centuries, papal funerals have been elaborate affairs, ceremonies befitting a Renaissance prince or other regal figure. But in recent years, the rites have been simplified. As Pope Francis has mandated, here are the steps that the ritual will follow.",
      "First station: Preparation of the body",
      "The funeral rites take place in three parts, called stations. The first takes place in the pope's private chapel, after medical professionals have certified his death. Until recently, this stage had taken place at the pope's bedside.",
      "After the body lies in rest in the chapel, the cardinal serving as the pope's camerlengo \u2014 the pope's chief of staff \u2014 will make the arrangements for the funeral. He is also tasked with running the Vatican until a new pope is elected. The current camerlengo is Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, appointed by Francis in 2019.",
      "As has been done for centuries, the camerlengo will formally call the deceased pope by the full name given to him when he was baptized as an infant \u2014 Jorge Mario Bergoglio. There are narratives or legends stating that, at this time, the pope was also tapped three times on the forehead with a small silver hammer. However, there is no documented proof that this was actually done in earlier centuries to verify a pope's death.",
      "Traditionally, another ancient rite will also take place after the declaration of the pope's death: the defacing of the pope's ring. Each pope wears a custom-made ring with an engraved image of a man fishing from a boat, hearkening back to the gospel of Matthew, where Jesus calls St. Peter a \"fisher of men.\" This Fisherman's Ring, with the name of the current pope engraved over the image, could act as a seal on official documents. The camerlengo will break Francis' ring and smash the seal with a hammer or other instrument to prevent any other person from using it.",
      "The pope's apartments will also be locked, with no one allowed to enter; traditionally, this was done to prevent looting.",
      "Second station: Viewing the body",
      "The deceased pope will be dressed in his simple white cassock and red vestments, then placed in a simple wooden coffin. This will be carried in procession to St. Peter's Basilica, where the public viewing will take place for the next three days.",
      "The pope's body will be left in the plain, open casket during this viewing period in order to emphasize the pope's humble role as a pastor, not a head of state. The earlier practice would have been to place the body on top of a tall raised platform, called a catafalque; this ended with the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI in 2022.",
      "Pope Benedict was also the last pope to be buried in the traditional three coffins of cypress, lead and elm. Two coffins contained specific documents about his pontificate; the first coffin also held the traditional three bags of coins \u2014 gold, silver and copper \u2014 representing each year of his pontificate.",
      "At Francis' funeral, after the public viewing, a plain white cloth will be placed over the pope's face as he lies in the oak coffin, a continuing part of papal funerals. But this will be the first time that only a single coffin will be used; it will likely contain a document describing his pontificate and a bag of coins from his pontificate as well.",
      "The funeral Mass will then be celebrated at St. Peter's, most likely inside because of the late winter weather, and there will likely be a crowd of believers outside, assembled on the plaza. The homily will reflect on the life and spirituality of the deceased pope; Francis himself preached at the funeral of his retired predecessor, Pope Benedict. And the future Pope Benedict, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, preached at the funeral of Pope St. John Paul II when Ratzinger was the leader, or the dean, of all senior church officials \u2013 what's known as the College of Cardinals.",
      "The current dean is 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, and it is unclear whether he will be able to continue this tradition due to his advanced age. Masses will continue to be said in Francis' memory for nine days after his death \u2014 a period called the Novendialis. This ritual was inspired by an ancient Roman tradition prescribing a mourning period ending on the ninth day after a death.",
      "Third station: Burial",
      "Popes in the past have been buried in several different places. Until the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire in the early fourth century, popes would be interred in the catacombs, the burial grounds on the outskirts of Rome.",
      "Afterward, popes could be buried in a number of different locations, such as the Basilica of St. John Lateran \u2014 the official cathedral of Rome \u2014 or other churches in and around Rome. A few were even buried in France during the 14th century, when the papacy moved to the French border for political reasons.",
      "Most popes are buried in the grottoes underneath St. Peter's, and since Pope Leo XIII's burial at St. John Lateran in 1903, every pope has been buried at St. Peter's. According to Francis' wishes, however, there will likely be a procession across Rome to Santa Maria Maggiore, including the hearse and cars carrying others who will attend this private ritual.",
      "After a few final prayers and sprinkling of holy water, the coffin will be placed in its final location inside the church. Only later will the area be opened to the public for prayers and veneration.",
      "After so many journeys from Rome to visit Catholic communities in countries across the globe, and so many visits to this basilica for prayer and meditation, it seems fitting that, at the end of his life's journey, Francis would make one last trip to the church he loved so much to be laid to rest forever.",

      "The Vatican announced that the canonization of Carlo Acutis will be next Sunday in St. Peter's Square on the occasion of the Jubilee celebration of adolescents. It was originally scheduled to happen on April 27, the second Sunday of Easter.",
      "Acutis died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15. Born in London to wealthy Italian parents, he grew up in Milan, where he managed the website for his parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world.",
      "His road to sainthood started more than 10 years ago at the initiative of a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis began his papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body - wearing sneakers, jeans and a sweatshirt - was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a major site linked to St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was declared \"blessed\" or beatified \u2014 the first step toward sainthood \u2014 in 2020 after one miracle was attributed to him. In that miracle, Acutis is credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "A second miracle was attributed to Acutis in May 2024. It involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",

The pope's death initiates a centuries-old process of rituals and traditions that culminates with a conclave, a gathering of the Church's current 135 Cardinal Electors who are sealed inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next pontiff.",
      "Here's what's to come in the following days.",
      "Day One",
      "The pope was formally pronounced dead by the Cardinal Camerlengo \u2014 currently Irish-born American Kevin Farrell \u2014 who is one of the most important Vatican officials during the interregnum period.",
      "Traditionally, the camerlengo (chamberlain) would tap a silver hammer on the pope's head while calling out his baptismal name three times. The hammer is no longer used. Far more conventionally, an electrocardiogram was used to confirm John Paul II's death in 2005.",
      "Farrell then made a\u00a0statement announcing\u00a0the news: \"At 7:35 this morning, The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father's house. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His church.\"",
      "Once the camerlengo pronounces the pope dead, and before sealing the papal apartment, he breaks the pope's Fisherman's ring and destroys the dies used to make the papal seal for apostolic letters, to symbolize the end of the pontificate.",
      "These items will be buried with the pope. But first, the pontiff is transported to lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica. Hundreds of thousands of mourners descended on Vatican City after the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2022\u00a0 to pay their respects.",
      "Novemdiales",
      "Pope Francis's death will be followed by a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales, a tradition that dates back to Roman times.",
      "Vatican flags will fly at half-staff, and the bronze doors of St Peter's Basilica are closed.",
      "The funeral must take place four to six days after the pope's death. Weather permitting, it will be held in St. Peter's Square. Most recent popes have asked to be buried beneath the Basilica there, but Francis said he would be laid to rest in Rome's St. Mary Major Basilica. He also asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket.",
      "The papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the body, and then the burial.",
      "At the funeral, attended by kings, queens, heads of state and religious leaders, the coffin will be carried through the so-called \"door of death\" to the left of the main altar, and a single bell will toll. The coffin will then be taken in procession from St. Peter's to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome for entombment.",
      "During the nine-day mourning period, cardinals from around the world gather in Rome and begin meeting in \"General Congregations,\" a sort of campaigning period where various papal candidates give speeches about their visions for the church, mapping out the direction they think it should take.",
      "The conclave",
      "Between 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, voting will begin, as the Cardinal Electors of the papal conclave isolate themselves from the world and begin the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 currently a group of about 135 \u2014 are eligible to vote.",
      "Behind closed doors in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the cardinals will cast ballots for their choice, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.",

      "Property developer Truong My Lan had already lost a challenge against the death penalty in a separate case in which she was found guilty in April last year of stealing money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and fraud amounting to $27 billion.",
      "The appeal court ruled there was no basis to reduce her sentence but said she could still escape the death penalty if she returned three-quarters of the stolen assets. That means she could still avoid execution if she returns $9 billion, or three-quarters of the $12 billion she embezzled, the\u00a0BBC reported.",
      "Four months later, an appeal court in Ho Chi Minh City ruled on Monday that a life sentence she was handed for three crimes during a second trial in October would be reduced to 30 years.",
      "\"Lan played the major role... (but) we also take into consideration the amount of money that Lan has spent on overcoming the consequences,\" judge Pham Cong Muoi said following discussions during the appeal about how her assets may be used to compensate victims of her crimes.",
      "Prosecutors said she had repaid a quarter of the $1.2 billion she defrauded from thousands of bond investors.",
      "\"The total value of her holdings actually exceeds the required compensation amount,\" lawyer Nguyen Huy Thiep told the BBC before her appeal was rejected. \"However, these require time and effort to sell, as many of the assets are real estate and take time to liquidate. Truong My Lan hopes the court can create the most favorable conditions for her to continue making compensation.\"",
      "Lan's husband Chu Lap Co did not appeal, but the judging panel concluded that his two-year sentence should be cut by half after he paid back the $1.2 million he was found to have laundered.",
      "In her final words before the court last week, Lan described what happened as \"an accident.\"",
      "\"Since being jailed, I have tried my best... to seek the best solutions to (deal with my) projects and properties,\" she was quoted as saying by state media.",
      "\"Please acknowledge my effort,\" she added.",
      "Court determined Lan was \"the mastermind\"",
      "The 68-year-old was found guilty in October of laundering $17.7 billion and illegal cross-border trafficking of $4.5 billion.",
      "She was also found guilty of bond fraud.",
      "The court determined during the trial that Lan was \"the mastermind, committed the crime with sophisticated methods, many times, causing especially serious consequences.\"",
      "During her first trial in April 2024, Lan was found guilty of embezzling $12.5 billion but prosecutors said the damages caused by the scam totaled $27 billion \u2014 equivalent to around 6% of Vietnam's 2023 GDP.",
      "Lan owned just 5% of shares in SCB on paper but the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90% through family, friends and staff.",
      "Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in the bank lost money, prompting rare protests in the communist nation.",
      "During her trial, Lan was sometimes defiant, but in the recent hearings for her appeal against the sentence she was more contrite,\u00a0the BBC reported. She said she was ashamed to have been such a drain on the state, and that her only thought was to pay back what she had taken.",
      "\"I feel pained due to the waste of national resources,\" Lan said in November, adding she felt \"very embarrassed to be charged with this crime.\"",

      "Dementia cases continue to rise in the U.S., with people over age 55 facing a 42% risk of developing the condition in their lifetime.",
      "A recent study led by Johns Hopkins predicted half a million dementia cases in 2025 and one million per year by 2060.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean people are powerless in reducing their risk, however, according to Dr. Joel Salinas, a behavioral neurologist and associate professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.",
      "BLOOD PRESSURE AND DEMENTIA RISK SHARE SURPRISING LINK, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Salinas joined Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview to discuss what\u2019s driving the spike in dementia cases and what behavioral changes could provide some degree of cognitive protection.\u00a0(See the video at the top of the article.)",
      "Dementia drivers",
      "One of the biggest factors in the increase is demographics, noted Salinas, who is also the co-founder and chief medical officer of Isaac Health, a virtual memory clinic for brain health and memory issues.",
      "Dementia cases continue to rise in the U.S., with people over age 55 facing a 42% risk of developing the condition in their lifetime. (iStock)",
      "\"The baby boomer population, being one of the largest groups, is also the fastest-aging group,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"As we get more and more baby boomers \u2014 not just over 65, but into their 70s and 80s \u2014 we're going to see more and more of them developing some degree of cognitive impairment due to a plethora of reasons.\"",
      "Age is indeed the biggest risk factor, he noted.",
      "\"After age 65, our risk starts to increase. By the time we get to our 80s, that risk is about one in three,\" he said. \"And then after 85, it starts to go up even higher, to almost one in two.\"",
      "\"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk.\"",
      "The pandemic could have played a role as well, the neurologist said.",
      "\"This is still being understood, but it seems like COVID-19 also affected blood vessels in the body and the brain,\" he said. \"So people who already had a vulnerability for developing dementia could have had an acceleration or an earlier presentation.\"",
      "STROKE, DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION SHARE THESE 17 PREVENTABLE RISK FACTORS",
      "Research has also shown that loneliness and social isolation can increase one\u2019s risk of cognitive decline.",
      "\"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk,\" Salinas said.",
      "A recent study led by Johns Hopkins predicted half a million dementia cases in 2025 and one million per year by 2060. (iStock)",
      "\"There's still a lot being done to figure out, you know, the chicken or the egg \u2014 is it that you're developing the disease and you're presenting with symptoms of loneliness earlier than others, or is it the loneliness and social isolation that increases your risk? I think it's probably both.\"",
      "There is a genetic component of dementia, the neurologist said, but the good news is that it\u2019s rare.",
      "SMARTPHONE USE COULD REDUCE DEMENTIA RISK IN OLDER ADULTS, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"If you think about risks and protective factors like a seesaw, these rare genetic mutations may outweigh anything protective you do, but the nice thing is that because they're rare, the chances are you don't have those risks,\" he said.",
      "\"So you probably have genetic risk that can be outweighed to some degree by protective factors.\"",
      "Risk-reducing behaviors",
      "A major study published last year in The Lancet found that almost half of dementia cases are potentially preventable with lifestyle modifications.",
      "There are many different factors to address, Salinas said, with proper nutrition and exercise topping the list.",
      "\"Obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder, affects blood pressure, heart disease and brain health,\" the neurologist said. (iStock)",
      "Addressing hearing loss by using a hearing aid can also help keep dementia at bay, according to the neurologist, as can staying socially engaged.",
      "Quitting smoking and limiting alcohol consumption can also boost prevention, as does getting enough quality sleep.",
      "HEALTH BOOST AND DEMENTIA PREVENTION IN JUST 5 MINUTES A DAY",
      "Entering a specific stage of sleep called \"slow wave\" or \"stage three\" helps to clear out the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain, Salinas said.",
      "\"If someone is having issues with sleep, we send them to see a sleep specialist to do the proper testing,\" he said. \"Obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder, affects blood pressure, heart disease and brain health. And it's something that's treatable.\"",
      "The female gynecologist smiles while explaining the test results to her patient. (iStock)",
      "With any healthy behavior, consistency is key.",
      "\"It\u2019s about putting the odds in your favor that you'll be less likely to develop one of these conditions, or at least delay the onset of symptoms,\" Salinas said.",
      "\"It's never too late to take them on, but whenever you start them, the more consistent you are with them, the bigger return you'll have.\"",
      "Early detection is key",
      "Salinas cited studies showing that 92% of people with mild cognitive impairment go undiagnosed.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"That's when we really want to intervene \u2014 but most of the time, people are being diagnosed when the condition is moderate to severe.\"",
      "While it can be tricky to distinguish between the regular effects of aging and early signs of dementia, Salinas called out some key differentiators.",
      "\"It\u2019s about putting the odds in your favor that you'll be less likely to develop one of these conditions, or at least delay the onset of symptoms.\"",
      "\"We have more difficulty with memory and thinking as we get older, but it should never be to the point where it interferes with our day-to-day functioning,\" he said.",
      "It\u2019s normal to experience \"blips\" once in a while, he said, like forgetting your keys, blanking on the name of a celebrity, or walking into a room and not remembering why you entered.",

      "\"But if you're seeing that happen much more frequently over time and it\u2019s getting worse, that might suggest there is something neurodegenerative and not just normal or typical aging,\" Salinas advised.",
      "To help ensure earlier diagnosis and intervention, Salinas recommends speaking with a healthcare provider as soon as atypical symptoms are noticed.",
      "\"Not all doctors or medical providers are the same,\" the neurologist said. \"A common story we hear is that people\u2019s symptoms get dismissed.\" (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)",
      "\"It\u2019s important to take them seriously \u2014 but not all doctors or medical providers are the same,\" he cautioned. \"A common story we hear is that people\u2019s symptoms get dismissed.\"",
      "In this case, Salinas suggests getting a second opinion, preferably from a neurology specialist.",

      "\"There is more and more that can be done to manage symptoms at the earliest stages,\" he said.",
      "\"And at a minimum, if you do end up having a condition that doesn't have a cure, you\u2019ll be empowered with information about your health that will help you make better decisions and plan for the future.\"",

      "\"I think that gets to your policy, sir, of meritocracy \u2013 that we should be looking at those who have real merit to get in,\" Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who was standing over Trump's shoulder as he signed, chimed in. \"And we have to look harder at those universities that aren't enforcing that.\"",
      "The accreditation reforms, along with the president's Executive Orders on school discipline and \"disparate impact theory,\" were all connected to pulling back from the Biden administration's era of prioritizing DEI over meritocracy.

We want to focus on results, we want to focus on actual fairness, we want to focus on merit, not things like disparate impact theory and the whole sort-of diversity, equity and inclusion cult.\"",

      "Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a lawsuit Monday against Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, alleging the popular platform has been \"openly defying\" state law aimed at protecting young minors from addictive social media features and obscene and dangerous content.",
      "Attorney General Uthmeier, who was recently appointed by Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, alleged in a circuit court complaint filed Monday that Snapchat utilizes addictive features to attract minors under the age of 13, who companies like Snapchat aren't even allowed to provide accounts to under state law H.B. 3 in Florida.",
      "The suit also alleges Snapchat does not adequately verify its users' ages, noting parental consent is required in Florida for Snapchat users who are under 16, and has been deceptive about its identification of content that is not supposed to be accessible to minors.",
      "\"Snap's conduct is particularly egregious because it continues to market Snapchat in Florida as safe for users as young as 13 even though it knows that Snapchat can be easily used to access pornography and buy drugs, among many other dangers,\" Uthmeier's complaint states. \"Rather than obeying Florida law by removing 13-year-old users from the platform and seeking parental consent for 14- and 15-year-old users, Snap is actively deceiving Florida parents about the risks of allowing their teens to access this platform.\"",

He pointed to Snapchat's \"Find Friends\" feature as well, among others, which Uthmeier alleged has \"connected minors with adult strangers seeking to groom, harass, exploit, and even assault them, or to sell them illegal drugs.\"",
      "According to Uthmeier, Snapchat has recognized in other litigation that it is subject to the provisions under Florida's H.B. 3, leading him to assert in the Monday complaint that the platform is \"openly defying this important public health measure.\"",
      "However, Snap Inc. argues that the underlying premise of Uthmeier's complaint, that Snapchat is violating H.B. 3, is flawed because the law infringes on the First Amendment rights of adults and young people. Simultaneously, Snap Inc. said, H.B. 3 fails to adequately address age verification and opens up Floridians to data protection and privacy issues.",
      "TEENS ARE TURNING TO SNAPCHAT'S \u2018MY AI\u2019 FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT \u2013 WHICH DOCTORS WARN AGAINST",
      "\"We believe there are more privacy-conscious solutions to online safety and managing age verification, including at the operating system, app store, or device level,\"\u00a0a Snap Inc. spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"In addition, there is a current challenge to the constitutionality of this law pending in Florida federal court, and we hoped that the state would allow this challenge to proceed through the proper legal process. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve decided to file a complaint in state court in an attempt to bypass the issues that are already being heard in federal court.\"",

      "H.B. 3 has been challenged by industry groups in a lawsuit last year arguing the state law violated First Amendment rights. The plaintiff's in that suit, the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, which collectively represent numerous major social media platforms including Snapchat, have also challenged other state laws aimed at protecting minors from harmful social media features and content on the grounds they violate the First Amendment.",
      "The law prohibits social media apps that utilize certain addictive features, such as push notifications, autoplay features, infinity scrolling, and more, from allowing users under the age of 13 to open an account. For users under 16, parental notification must be obtained.",
      "The bill also requires companies like Snapchat that knowingly publish adult content on their platforms to take steps to prohibit access to such material by any users under 18.",
      "SNAPCHAT AI CHATBOT ALLEGEDLY GAVE ADVICE TO 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL ON RELATIONSHIP WITH 31-YEAR-OLD MAN, HAVING SEX",
      "According to the law, any platforms that knowingly or recklessly violate H.B. 3's requirements can be subject to enforcement under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, which can result in fines of up to $50,000 per incident. Meanwhile, account holders who are minors may also pursue up to $10,000 in damages.",

      "If you haven\u2019t heard the buzz about Manus yet, it's the new AI model unveiled by a Singapore-based company called Butterfly Effect. This isn\u2019t just another chatbot. It\u2019s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.",
      "Sounds impressive, right? But here\u2019s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you\u2019re eager to try out the latest AI or you\u2019d rather steer clear, it\u2019s worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety.",

      "Your data could be used to train AI, even if you go nowhere near it",
      "This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been\u00a0several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for\u00a0use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\"",
      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",

      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As we move forward with AI like Manus, it\u2019s exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data.",
      "So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe.",

      "Flying robots bring precision and efficiency to harvesting",
      "Tevel\u2019s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs) are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from covering data breaches over the years, it\u2019s that you should never take a company\u2019s initial numbers at face value. When a breach becomes public, most companies try to minimize the damage by reporting fewer victims or staying vague about what kind of data was exposed.",
      "Sometimes, to be fair, they genuinely don\u2019t have the full picture yet. But that rarely gets communicated clearly. The same thing just happened again with an insurtech company that has now doubled the number of people affected by a breach it disclosed last year.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Texas-based insurance administrative services provider Landmark Admin has revised the scope of its May 2024 cyberattack, revealing that nearly twice as many people were impacted as initially reported. Back in October 2024, Landmark disclosed that suspicious activity was detected in its network on May 13, prompting an investigation. At the time,\u00a0it was estimated that the breach affected 806,519 individuals. But in a recent update filed with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s office, that number has now jumped to 1,613,773.",
      "Landmark serves as a third-party administrator offering backend support to major insurers like Liberty Bankers Life and American Benefit Life. This means millions of sensitive insurance policy records flow through its systems, making it a tempting target for cybercriminals.",
      "The compromised information varies for each individual but may include a wide range of sensitive personal data. This includes full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or state-issued identification numbers, passport numbers and bank account details. In some cases, medical information, dates of birth, health insurance policy numbers and details related to life and annuity policies may also have been exposed.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from insurance data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.",

      "\u200b\u200bImagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That\u2019s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They\u2019re developing the world\u2019s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable.",
      "This is part of Yamaha\u2019s big plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, using a mix of electric, alternative fuels and now hydrogen technology.",

      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The big, big moment: First hydrogen fill-up",
      "To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha\u2019s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it\u2019s fueled by gaseous hydrogen.",
      "Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who\u2019s been deeply involved in the project, called it\u00a0\"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly.",

      "RIDE THE WAVES WITH THE MOST ADVANCED WAKE BOAT EVER",
      "What\u2019s different about this hydrogen outboard?",
      "Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",

      "4-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE",
      "Safety first: Smart systems on board",
      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

      "Yamaha first showed off this hydrogen outboard at the Miami Boat Show, then took it to the SEMA Show in Las Vegas to get the automotive and marine industries talking about hydrogen infrastructure. They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",
      "Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we\u2019re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says an Apple Watch saved psychiatrist Amanda Faulkner by detecting deadly leukemia early.",
      "In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something\u2019s wrong. From tracking heart rate and sleep patterns to measuring blood oxygen levels, smartwatches are helping people stay more in tune with their health than ever before.",

      "The life-saving power of wearable technology",
      "Take Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",
      "Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived.",

      "HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "The wider impact of Amanda\u2019s story",
      "Amanda\u2019s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",
      "Amanda remains in treatment, including chemotherapy and an upcoming stem cell transplant, but she remains optimistic and grateful for the smartwatch that gave her a fighting chance. She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health.",
      "Apple Watch saves woman\u2019s life (Amanda Faulkner) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "Limitations and risks of smartwatch health monitoring",
      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they\u2019re becoming essential health companions. While they don\u2019t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early. So, if your smartwatch starts \"nagging\" you about your health, it might just be worth paying attention to it.",

This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",
      "When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully.",

      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to steal your data. As people become more aware of common threats like phishing links, fake websites, fraudulent emails and impersonation scams, attackers are becoming more creative in their approach.",
      "One of the newer methods they are using involves targeting USB flash drives. It may seem surprising that they would focus on something as simple as a flash drive, but the data it holds can be valuable.",
      "Plus, flash drives can be used to spread malware to other devices.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Person plugging USB flash drive into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why target USB flash drives?",
      "USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "When infected, USB drives can spread\u00a0malware not just within a single organization but also across multiple entities if shared. These attacks don\u2019t rely on network vulnerabilities, allowing them to bypass traditional security tools.",
      "USB flash drive plugged into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How hackers are targeting your USB drives",
      "As reported by\u00a0Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim\u2019s system.",
      "These tools don\u2019t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It\u2019s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.",
      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "4 practical ways to stay safe from USB-targeted attacks",
      "1. Don\u2019t plug in unknown USB drives:\u00a0It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender\u2019s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",
      "3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many attacks like GOFFEE\u2019s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Scan USB drives before use:\u00a0The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",
      "How to scan a USB flash drive for malware (PC & Mac)",
      "No matter which antivirus tool you use, it\u2019s essential to scan USB flash drives as soon as you plug them in. Here\u2019s how to do it on both platforms:",
      "For Windows PC",
      "Insert your USB flash drive into your computer",
      "Open your installed antivirus software",
      "Look for a\u00a0Custom Scan or\u00a0Scan Specific Drive option",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it\u2019s worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They\u2019re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don\u2019t need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.",

      "Walsh told Fox News Digital that the woman's cause of death will be determined by a medical examiner, and added that \"internet rumors are just that.\"",
      "The rumors began circulating on a Facebook group called \"New England Serial Killer,\" which has since changed its name due to Facebook rules and regulations. Over the last two months, human remains have been located in New Haven, Norwalk, Groton and Killingly, Connecticut; Foster, Rhode Island; and Framingham,\u00a0Plymouth and now Springfield, Massachusetts.

      "\"I am curious about what was recovered around the body,\" he said. \"There might have been paraphernalia suggestive of activity that is deemphasizing homicide (perhaps incorrectly) to the investigators because that article is quite tepid.

      "The White House did not respond to questions by Fox News Digital on whether the U.S. would still aid Ukraine in some capacity, particularly given recent restrictions on military aid Trump has implemented on Kyiv, like refusing to sell Patriot missiles previously used to defend civilian populations from Russian strikes and that cost $1.5 billion a piece.",
      "\"If we want to be a global superpower, and we want to deter aggression, not with U.S. troops on the ground, but in general, to deter aggression \u2013 including potentially with China against Taiwan \u2013 because it is good for our national security, then we should think about good options to continue to support Ukraine,\" former CIA Moscow Station Chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. \"It's a tiny percentage of the Department of Defense budget.\"",

      "\"Its Ukraine's war of self-defense but its in our interest to deter Putin just as we did with his Soviet predecessors,\" Hoffman said. \"If our goal is to break Putin's alliance with Iran, North Korea and China, then the best way to do it is to prove that Putin's war on Ukraine is a loser for him.\"",

      "The Kremlin\u2019s position has given credence to repeated warnings from security experts that Putin is not interested in securing a peace deal with Ukraine.",
      "\"There's no indication that Putin wants to stop the war,\" Hoffman said. \"That isn't surprising. Because for a war to end, somebody has to win or both sides have to be so tired they can't continue to fight.",
      "\"Russia is the invader, so you have to stop them in order to have an end of the war,\" he added. \"The one consistent thing here is Putin is continuing to fight. His objective is to overthrow the government in Ukraine. He\u2019s going to keep fighting until he feels like he has accomplished that goal or he can't fight anymore.\"",

      "A report by the Moscow Times on Tuesday cited sources close to Putin and said the Kremlin chief is looking to reorder the global \"spheres of influence\" by negotiating leverage points between the U.S. and adversaries like Iran and North Korea.",
      "The article claimed that Putin would attempt to get Trump to either force a less-than-desirable deal for Ukraine or potentially stop the U.S. from aiding Kyiv by proposing personally enticing deals, like allowing Trump to build a hotel in Moscow, and geopolitical wins, like securing a nuclear agreement with Iran and a \"peace deal\" in Ukraine.",

      "\"The important aspect of all of this is to give these adversaries face-saving opportunities, which is not a strong point for the U.S. style of diplomacy,\" Koffler said. \"But Putin\u2019s ability to convince Trump and Trump\u2019s decision calculus are two different things.\"",

      "During his 12-year pontificate, Francis took several actions to limit the use of the Latin Mass throughout the world. The result was that the Latin Mass was relegated to a very limited number of churches, with it often only being offered by priests belonging to specific orders expressly devoted to it.",
      "In 2021, Francis issued a set of instructions, called a \"motu proprio,\" in which he placed sweeping restrictions on the Latin Mass, including requiring priests wanting to say the mass to seek express approval from their local bishops. In 2023, Francis issued additional restrictions on the Latin Mass, requiring bishops to obtain express approval from the Vatican to allow it to be said in their jurisdictions and barring newly ordained priests from saying it.",
      "The instructions diverged from the policy of Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who had allowed all priests to say the Latin Mass.",

      "Francis' move to change these papal funeral traditions, some of which date all the way back to ancient Rome, stemmed from a desire to emphasize that the pope is \"that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world,\" according to Archbishop Diego Ravelli, the head of\u00a0papal liturgical ceremonies who reportedly worked with Francis to help make the revisions. The rewrite was also preceded by the unusual circumstances of Pope Benedict XVI's funeral, which deviated from traditional papal funerals on account of the fact he was a retired pope rather than a reigning one.",
      "The new funeral rites were formally approved by Francis in 2023 and were later published in the church's liturgical guidelines in early 2024. Around the same time he was working on these revisions, the pope revealed during an interview with a Spanish-language broadcaster that he would not be buried in the grottoes of the Vatican like his predecessors, but rather at Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome. The new papal rights make it permissible for future popes to be buried outside the Vatican as well.",
      "POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS",
      "In addition to the different burial location, the new papal funeral rites have amended the way the pope will be viewed by the public following his death. In the past, the pope's body would be displayed on an elevated frame known as a bier. But, under the new funeral structure, the pope will be laid directly into an open coffin, eliminating the use of the bier. Pope Francis also eliminated the practice of being buried in three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.",
      "The location of where Francis would be declared deceased changed too. It went from taking place in the papal bedroom to now inside the papal chapel located at the Vatican. The new rules also require that Pope Francis' remains be immediately put into a simplistic wooden-lined coffin after he is determined to have passed.",

      "The Trump administration's latest efforts to soften its trade stance amid a market rebellion are running into a harsh reality: Other nations do not yet appear willing to negotiate.",
      "On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated remarks he'd made to investors at a private conference Tuesday that the tariffs standoff with China was \"unsustainable.\"",
      "But he said that any de-escalation would have to be mutual \u2014 and had not yet been initiated by the White House.",
      "In response, an official with China's U.S. embassy accused the U.S. of continuing to mistreat it.",
      "\u201cOur doors are open if the U.S. wants to talk,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIf a negotiated solution is what the U.S. truly wants, it should stop threatening and blackmailing China and seek dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit. To keep asking for a deal while exerting extreme pressure is not the right way to deal with China and simply will not work.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a European Union representative told The Wall Street Journal that it was not going to abandon its value-added tax or the agricultural subsidies its nations provide to the regions farmers.",
      "The official also posted to X that the E.U. was seeking to strengthen and expand ties to other nations, indicating it was positioning itself as a counter-weight to the instability set off by the Trump administration.",
      "Major stock indexes, as well as bond markets, saw earlier gains evaporate Wednesday as the day wore on and investors grasped that  the rest of the world was not shifting its hard-line posture.",
      "Indeed, the reactions from China and the E.U. may be a response to a sense that it now has leverage. Despite weeks of market turmoil, the White House's new, softer stance appeared to be in response to the threat of physical shortages on U.S. retail shelves \u2014\u00a0an experience Trump lived through during his first term as the pandemic unfolded.",
      "According to a person familiar with the White House's thinking, some companies have stated the tariff rates on imported goods are now so high that they have effectively become embargoes, and the firms have simply stopped bringing in goods in response.",
      "The White House was particularly concerned about shortages of products around the holidays, the person said. The Christmas ordering cycle is starting and July Fourth is coming up where retailers might not have the summer products, like beach chairs, umbrellas, grills, fireworks or light-up trinkets.",
      "Bessent told a Washington, D.C., conference that \u201cmore than 100 countries\u201d have now approached the U.S. to address trade imbalances, though he reasserted a key Trump talking point that the rest of the world, as well as past U.S. presidents, were responsible for harming America\u2019s heartland.",
      "\u201cFor decades, successive administrations relied on faulty assumptions that our trading partners would implement policies that would drive a balanced global economy,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cInstead, we face the stark reality of large and persistent U.S. deficits as a result of an unfair trading system.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cIntentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out America\u2019s manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains, putting our national and economic security at risk.\u201d",
      "Bessent's remarks initially sent markets higher. But after Bessent, and later, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, said there would be no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China, stocks pared gains significantly, while U.S. government bonds sold off after an earlier rally.",

      "A 0.63-ounce hexagonal jar of the amber-colored balm typically sells in the U.S. for about $8. But its sole American distributor, Prince of Peace Enterprises, based in Livermore, California, says retail prices could soon rise as President Donald Trump hiked up tariffs on China as high as 145%.",
      "The ointment for the U.S. markets is produced at a factory in China and, at the current tax rate, the distributor is anticipating $3 million to $5 million in tariff costs this year for Tiger Balm products, said Matt Chin, Prince of Peace president. At least some of that may be passed onto consumers, but not for now.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re adopting a more measured approach,\u201d Chin said. \u201cOur customers rely on us, and we want to hold off on raising prices.\u201d",
      "Har Paw Corp., a pharmaceutical company based in Singapore, is the headquarters for Tiger Balm products. But the American product comes out of China, and sells more than $30 million worth of the ointment in the U.S annually. Har Paw didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",

In recent years, the product has found international appeal, gaining endorsement from basketball's Jeremy Lin and pop star Lady Gaga.",
      "Trump roiled global markets last month when he imposed punishing reciprocal tariffs on imports from 90 nations, including more than a dozen from Asia. He has since announced a 90-day pause on the additional levies for most countries \u2014 while keeping in place a 10% baseline rate \u2014 but raised the tax on Chinese imports to 125%. China has retaliated by hiking up tariffs on American goods from 84% to 125%.",
      "The current rate for pharmaceutical imports, which form the backbone of Prince of Peace\u2019s inventory, are set at 20%, and they\u2019re exempt from new reciprocal tariffs. But Trump has vowed to impose \u201cmajor tariffs\u201d on the products soon.",
      "Prince and Peace supplies Tiger Balm to chains like CVS and Walmart as well as local pharmacies. Chin said the company has continued to place inventory and absorbed rising tariff costs. So far, there\u2019s been no change in demand because the company hasn\u2019t raised prices. But the challenge is that big box retailers often require price changes to be announced 90 days in advance, Chin said.",
      "\u201cIf Walmart, for example, won\u2019t make an exception for the price increase due to tariffs, that means as the seller we would have to eat the difference,\u201d he said.",
      "Prince of Peace also carries hundreds of ginseng products, herbal teas and other health supplements imported from China that have no Western alternatives.",
      "Research has shown that tariff costs are borne mostly by U.S. consumers and businesses. New tariffs on China affect about 13% of U.S. imports and may cost consumers up to $25 billion annually, according to a report from the center-right economics research nonprofit American Action Forum. In 2018, when Trump implemented sweeping tariffs during his first term, the U.S. lost roughly $7.2 billion in real income.",
      "Yan Liang, a professor of economics at Willamette University in Oregon, said specialty goods like Tiger Balm and ginseng don\u2019t compete with U.S. manufacturing and jobs. Rather, they create jobs and revenue in the service sector.",
      "\u201cDistributors may have to absorb some of the rising costs so prices don\u2019t have to rise too much to deter consumers,\u201d Liang said. \u201cIn both scenarios, these small Chinese American distributors are being squeezed.\u201d",
      "Chin is also the president of the Oriental Food Association, which represents more than 40 Asian food importers and distributors in Northern California. He said the group has been engaging with trade representatives and the Chinese consulate in San Francisco for more clarity about the economic outlook of the tariffs.",
      "Smaller herbal shops and medicine halls in Chinatowns across the U.S., Chin said, are taking a bigger hit from the tariffs as they run on narrower margins. But he is optimistic that the Chinese American business community will weather the storm, as it did in 2018, when Trump imposed up to 25% tariffs on imported Chinese goods.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a blow to morale,\u201d Chin said, \u201cbut we\u2019re strong and will get through these setbacks as a whole.\u201d"

      "A group of protesters is planning to set up tent encampments on Columbia University campuses this week in protest of the war in Gaza, according to three people familiar with the planning and a recording of a meeting to plan the action shared with NBC News.",
      "The planned encampments come just over a year after students first erected about 50 tents on a university lawn to protest the war and drew the world's attention.",
      "Those demonstrations, in part, fueled the Trump administration's effort to extract concessions from Columbia, saying the university failed to quell antisemitism on its campus.",
      "Planning for the encampments has been shrouded in secrecy.",
      "The coordinating meeting took place at a community center on Tuesday night in Brooklyn\u2019s Bushwick neighborhood, approximately 12 miles from campus, according to screenshots of Signal messages from organizers and a person who was at the meeting.",
      "Invitations for the meeting were largely distributed in person or verbally over the phone, according to the person who attended the meeting and asked not to be named due to fears of discipline from the school.",
      "More than 100 people were present at the gathering and all wore masks to conceal their identities, according to the person. It is unclear if all of the participants were Columbia students, the person said.",
      "The student organizers did not introduce speakers by name and instead used Signal usernames and code names \u2014 including the beloved Pok\u00e9mon \u201cSquirtle\u201d and words such as \u201cbutterfly\u201d \u2014 to distinguish one another, according to the recording.",
      "Organizers have also refrained from referring to the upcoming encampments as \"encampments,\" according to screenshots of Signal messages from the organizers and conversations with two people familiar with the planning for the protests. In writing, and verbally, participants have designated the encampments with a code name, the \u201ccircus.\"",
      "Organizers asked demonstrators not to arrive on campus wearing masks on the days of the protests, which they said could alert campus security officers, according to the recording.",
      "\u201cThis year feels so much more organized and careful,\u201d the person who was at the meeting said.",
      "Columbia did not confirm or deny whether it knew about the upcoming protests.",
      "\u201cOur focus is on protecting the safety of our community and ensuring that the University is able to proceed normally with all academic activities,\" a university spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are closely monitoring, as always, for any disruptions, and campus activities are currently proceeding as usual.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that encampments are against the university's policies and participation could result in disciplinary action.",
      "Students are planning to erect an encampment on Thursday at the university's main campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights neighborhood and a second encampment on Friday at the university's nearby Manhattanville campus, according to the recording.",
      "\"When we take over the lawn, our goal is to unify the space and make it our own,\" one of the organizers said, according to the recording.",
      "Thursday\u2019s encampment was planned to start at 1 p.m. on the West Butler Lawn of the university\u2019s main campus, where encampments were set up last year, according to the recording, and disperse before nightfall or before police enter the campus.",
      "There will be a second encampment that is expected to be more robust and begin the next day. It is unclear when the Friday encampment will begin, but according to the recording, students plan to stay indefinitely and expect arrests to be made.",
      "Organizers chose to stage Friday's encampment at the Manhattanville campus \u2014 the site of the university's business school \u2014 because it is not gated off to outsiders, unlike the main campus, according to a person who attended the meeting.",
      "A speaker at the meeting also said that the site of the second encampment was aimed at protesting the university's gentrification of Harlem, according to the recording.",
      "\"Any action that we do will bring police, will bring repression and we thought about that deeply and we're aware of that,\" a speaker at the meeting said to applause. \"And we're stuck in this situation where inaction is also violence.\"",
      "Organizers of the upcoming protests have distributed several guidelines, obtained by NBC News, to student protesters. These guidelines cover legal risks associated with protesting, best practices for encounters with law enforcement and strategies for securing their digital presence.",
      "The document on digital security advises that students communicate only through encrypted messaging services such as Signal, over the phone, or in person. It also suggests that students turn off Wi-Fi on their phones while protesting to avoid being traced by the university.",
      "Another form shared by the organizers and obtained by NBC News asks students to provide \"all the information necessary to support your legal defense\" for their emergency contacts in the event of  arrest.",
      "It asks for student protesters to list any medical conditions, insurance information, prescriptions, if they have dependents, where their government IDs are, their address and how emergency contacts can access their apartments or homes.",
      "\"Given the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to pursuing federal action against pro-Palestine protestors and the abduction of our comrade Mahmoud Khalil, we are now asking students to prepare not only for potential arrest and jail for several hours or overnight, but for the possibility of prolonged jail time,\" the form reads. \"Give serious thought to the question of how you would prepare for weeks or months in jail.\"",
      "The upcoming encampments precede a monthslong campaign of protests at the university last year, which inspired similar demonstrations at college campuses across the country and around the world. Dozens of students who participated in the encampments were arrested by local authorities or expelled from the university.",
      "The protests were prompted by the Israeli military\u2019s response to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israel. More than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza and millions have been displaced in the war that followed, according to health officials in Gaza.",
      "Student activists staged the demonstrations last year in an attempt to get their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government.",
      "The encampments also come amid the Trump administration's push to intervene in Columbia's affairs and some of the nation's oldest higher education institutions. The federal government\u00a0canceled the university\u2019s federal grants\u00a0on March 7, part of what the Trump administration says is a broader effort to \u201croot out\u201d antisemitism on college campuses.",
      "In an effort to restore the grants, which fund dozens of universities' top-tier research expeditions, Columbia agreed to a list of the administration's demands on March 21.",
      "The demands included instituting a mask ban at protests in most cases; hiring an outsider to oversee its department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; committing to \"greater institutional neutrality\"; and enlisting three dozen new security officers with newly installed powers to arrest students.",
      "Faced with its own deal by the Trump administration, Harvard University rejected the administration's demands and sued the administration several days later, aiming to restore billions in funding.",
      "The protests also come several weeks after federal immigration officials\u00a0apprehended at least three Columbia students\u00a0who participated in the student-led protests, including 30-year-old\u00a0Mahmoud Khalil."

      "A federal judge blocked officials Wednesday from moving a Palestinian student from Columbia University who was taken into custody during his naturalization interview in Vermont.",
      "U.S. District Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford extended a previous temporary restraining order that keeps the student, Mohsen Mahdawi, in the state, where he is a resident. Mahdawi is being held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Vermont.",
      "Lawyers for Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist, had filed a motion for his release, arguing that he is not a flight risk.",
      "\u201cMr. Mahdawi has deep community ties, a long history of being actively invested in the peace process, and nearly 80 individuals who can attest to his character,\u201d the filing said.",
      "However, Crawford declined to rule whether the federal government can continue to detain Mahdawi, or whether the court has jurisdiction over his habeas petition challenging his detention. The judge set a hearing for next week, at which he could decide to release him.",
      "Mahdawi, who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and is a U.S. permanent resident, was taken into custody last week by armed agents from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Mahdawi walked into what he thought was the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of the long pathway to citizenship, raising his right hand, answering questions and signing a document that \u201che was willing to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America,\u201d his attorneys said in court filings.",
      "\u201cIt was a trap. At approximately 12:00 P.M., the USCIS official informed Mr. Mahdawi that he needed to \u2018check\u2019 on some information and would be right back,\u201d the court filings said. \u201cICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled Mr. Mahdawi.\u201d",
      "Following the brief hearing Wednesday, Mahdawi said he did not want his supporters to lose hope and called on people to \u201cbelieve in the inevitability of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis hearing is part of the system of democracy; it prevents a tyrant from having unchecked power. I am in prison, but I am not imprisoned,\u201d Mahdawi said in the statement. \u201cA system of democracy guarantees freedom of speech, speaking of Palestine does not only qualify as freedom of speech, but it is also about our humanity. Keep the hope alive; I will see you under the sun.\u201d",
      "Mahdawi\u2019s attorney, Cyrus Mehta, accused the Trump Administration of being \"hellbent on detaining these students and treating them like criminals simply for exercising their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\"",
      "\u201cWe will continue to fight for Mohsen to be rightfully returned to his community in Vermont,\" Mehta said in a statement.",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin did not comment on the temporary restraining order or elaborate on Mahdawi's case. But she said in a statement that it is a \u201cprivilege\u201d to be granted a visa or green card.",
      "\u201cWhen you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "In the DHS notice for Mahdawi to appear, officials said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had \u201cdetermined that your presence and activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,\u201d the court filing said.",
      "Mahdawi\u2019s attorneys have said that the government\u2019s actions are retaliatory.",
      "\u201cPrior to and following Mr. Mahdawi\u2019s detention, the government has made clear that it intends to retaliate and punish individuals such as Mr. Mahdawi who advocated for ceasefire and ending the bloodshed in Gaza,\u201d their filing said. \u201cRespondents\u2019 actions plainly violate the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Mahdawi grew up in the al-Fara\u2019a refugee camp, where he witnessed Israeli military violence, according to court filings. At 15, the documents said, he was shot in the leg by an Israeli soldier. Mahdawi, who immigrated to the U.S. over a decade ago before attending Columbia University in 2021, became a key organizer of pro-Palestinian protests at the school last year.",
      "\u201cHe gave speeches at several of these protests. In these speeches, Mr. Mahdawi advocated for respect for international law, a permanent ceasefire, and a peaceful resolution that affirmed the human dignity of all,\u201d the court filings say.",
      "While Mahdawi lives in the U.S., much of his family still remains in the refugee camp, and Israeli authorities have repeatedly harassed them because of his advocacy, the filing says.",
      "\u201cMr. Mahdawi is fearful that, if he loses his lawful permanent resident status and he is removed to the West Bank, he will experience the same harassment, detention, and torture that his family has experienced, and would be in even more danger in light of the campaigns that have targeted and spread lies about him,\u201d\u00a0 the filing said.",
      "Mahdawi\u2019s case has prompted widespread criticism of the Trump administration and its stance on free speech. On Monday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., visited Mahdawi at the ICE facility.",
      "\u201cI want to tell everyone that I feel so loved and so supportive, and I am here in good hands,\" Mahdawi told Welch during the meeting. \u201cI am centered, I am clear, I am grounded, and I don\u2019t want you to worry about me. I want you to continue working for the democracy of this country and for humanity.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, accusing him of derailing negotiations to end the war in Ukraine while a peace deal was \u201cvery close.\u201d",
      "In a long post on Truth Social, Trump described Zelenskyy\u2019s rejection of Russia's takeover of Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, as \u201cvery harmful\u201d to achieving peace.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about here,\u201d he said at a media conference Tuesday. \u201cThis is against our constitution.\u201d",
      "During an Oval Office media event Wednesday evening, Trump suggested negotiations with Zelenskyy have been \u201charder\u201d than dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it\u2019s been harder.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump's comments come after months of discord between the two leaders, including a heated exchange in the Oval Office in February. The two men had a near-shouting match when Zelenskyy noted that Russia has broken previous agreements with Ukraine during a disagreement that included Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The situation escalated when Trump raised his voice and pointed his finger at Zelenskyy, accusing him of \"gambling with World War III\" and being \"disrespectful\" to the U.S.",
      "Trump ordered a pause on military aid, including providing Ukraine with intelligence, following the Oval Office clash.",
      "Zelenskyy urged Trump to visit Ukraine earlier this month after Russia launched two ballistic missiles at Sumy, killing 34 people and injuring 119. He suggested that a visit to the destruction would help U.S. leadership \"understand what Putin did.\"",
      "High-level talks aimed at bringing a pause to fighting in Ukraine disintegrated earlier after Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff pulled out, dealing a blow to Kyiv\u2019s hopes for a short-term peace agreement.",
      "While ministerial talks that had been planned in London fell apart, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, still planned to meet with Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who arrived in London early Wednesday with the Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers.",
      "The parties in London agreed to \"continue the dialogue,\" Yermak said on Telegram following the meeting.",
      "\"We conveyed our position and emphasized that an immediate, complete, and unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward launching negotiations aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace,\" he said. \"We expressed hope that this aligns with the vision of President Donald Trump.\"",
      "In a post on X, Zelenskyy commended the meeting, though \"emotions have run high.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s important that each side was not just a participant but contributed meaningfully. The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace.\"",
      "The latest setback comes during a week in which the Trump administration has doubled down on efforts to push Kyiv and Moscow toward a truce. Next week marks 100 days of Trump's second presidential term, and he promised to end the war on his first day back in office. Rubio suggested last week that the United States may walk away from ceasefire efforts, failing any further progress.",
      "Vance said earlier in the day that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the talks but also doubled down on the threat to walk away from negotiations.",
      "\u201cI think that we put together a very fair proposal,\u201d he told reporters on his trip in India. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see if the Europeans, the Russians and the Ukrainians are ultimately able to get this thing over the finish line.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the U.S. has not set a deadline for a ceasefire and that \"Russia does not consider it appropriate to set deadlines either,\" Russian news agency Tass reported.",
      "\"The downgrading is significant,\" said Bence N\u00e9meth, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at King\u2019s College London, citing Zelenskyy's rejection of Russia's maintaining control of Crimea as part of any deal.",
      "Rubio and Witkoff's absence \"suggests that Washington is increasingly disinterested in drawn-out, multilateral negotiations,\" N\u00e9meth added. \"This is not just about diplomacy fatigue. It also signals a hard pivot: The U.S. is not positioning itself as a neutral mediator.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed Tuesday that Rubio would skip the meeting hours after saying the opposite. \u201cThat is not a statement regarding the meetings. It\u2019s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite initial plans to attend the scheduled talks, neither Rubio nor Witkoff were in London on Wednesday, a European diplomat told NBC News.",
      "But representatives from the U.K., Germany and France still met with Yermak and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in what the British Foreign Ministry described as \"productive and successful\" discussions.",
      "\"All parties reiterated their strong support for President Trump\u2019s commitment to stopping the killing and achieving a just and lasting peace,\" the ministry said. \"The talks today were productive and successful, and significant progress was made on reaching a common position on next step.\"",
      "Expectations that Kyiv and Moscow would make a deal to end their three-year war this week remained low after the U.S. presented Ukraine and its European allies with peace proposals last week in Paris that both sides saw as unacceptable, according to NBC News\u2019 international partner, Sky News.",
      "Under a \u201cterms sheet\u201d offered by Rubio and Witkoff, a land-for-peace deal would recognize Russia\u2019s currently illegal annexation of Crimea and work toward lifting European Union sanctions on Russia. Both parties have since rejected the terms.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister, wrote on X that Ukraine was ready to negotiate \u201cbut not to surrender.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur people will not accept a frozen conflict disguised as peace,\u201d she wrote.",
      "After months of upbeat statements on indirect U.S.-led talks, but limited practical engagement, Putin on Tuesday suggested for the first time that he would be open to bilateral ceasefire talks with Zelenskyy.",
      "The issue of Crimea may well be one of the most difficult points of difference to overcome, said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\"I think it will be extraordinarily difficult, bordering on political suicide, for him [Zelenskyy] to commit to paper on things like giving up Crimea,\" Savill said. That said, \"Ukraine is not going to recapture Crimea anytime soon. Ukraine is unlikely to be a NATO member anytime soon.\"",
      "\"There might be some formulation [of a deal] that effectively kicks those into the long grass,\" he added, with the caveat that \"the terms of any deal at the moment are not going to be particularly favorable to Ukraine.\""

      "\u201cThis is George Lucas\u2019s dream for Star Wars manifest in its purist form,\u201d Griffin Schiller, a film critic and YouTube host, wrote on X, referring to the franchise\u2019s creator. \u201cAnti-authoritarian art delivered through populist channels.\u201d",
      "The new season, which debuted Tuesday on Disney+, focuses on a time when many in the galaxy live in fear of the fascistic Empire. It centers on thief-turned-rebel spy Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), whom fans first meet in the 2016 feature film \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story.\u201d",

      "Some have also said the franchise has gotten \u201ctoo woke.\u201d Last April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the studio\u2019s job was to \u201centertain, first and foremost\u201d and \u201cnot to advance any kind of agenda.\u201d",
      "Much of the negative sentiment toward the franchise appears to have shifted with the release of \u201cAndor,\u201d which has been described\u00a0as some of the best \u201cStar Wars\u201d storytelling ever.",
      "The season two premiere opens with Cassian stealing a prototype TIE fighter from an Empire base with help from an Imperial worker. When she tells him she\u2019s scared of the repercussions of helping the Rebellion, he gives her a rousing pep talk about the why of it all.",

      "\u201cThe very first scene that Krennic has where he talks about Ghorman, that\u2019s based on the Wannsee convention \u2014 the Nazi convention where the Nazis got together and planned the final solution over a business lunch,\u201d Gilroy said.",
      "In episode three, imperial troops search for \u201cundocumented\u201d workers who don\u2019t have visas on a planet on the outskirts of the galaxy. It is in this episode that the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise also delved into where it has never gone before by including a storyline in which an Imperial lieutenant tries to rape Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona), Cassian\u2019s love interest, who is hiding out with fellow Ferrix refugees on the planet where Imperial forces have landed.",

      "At this week\u2019s NFL draft, the 32 teams in the world\u2019s most profitable league will be searching for its most valuable commodity: a young, difference-making quarterback.",
      "Talent is only part of the appeal as new draftees enter the league on bargain, cost-controlled contracts. In a league in which offenses rely heavily on passing and the highest-paid veteran quarterbacks command $60 million annually, paying a starter a fraction of that amount makes it easier to build a championship-contending roster under the salary cap.",
      "Teams devote countless hours and resources toward what amounts to perhaps the highest-pressure job search in professional sports, all in hope of uncovering the next Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow or Brock Purdy, each of whom has led his team to a Super Bowl appearance while on a rookie deal since 2019.",
      "Yet all the investment in and spotlight on identifying a franchise\u2019s next great quarterback don\u2019t mean teams have gotten any better at picking them.",
      "Of the 75 quarterbacks selected in the first round since 2000, 35 earned at least one Pro Bowl appearance. Twenty-one did it multiple times. Just six went on to start and win Super Bowls, and five have been named the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player. For every 2004 draft class that produced future franchise cornerstones Philip Rivers, Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger, there is also a 2011, when the first round included future MVP Cam Newton but also three other quarterbacks who lasted less than 69 career games apiece.",
      "\u201cPlayer development and quarterback development is circumstantial, and there are different trajectories of development, and how players develop is really impacted by the circumstance and the village surrounding them,\u201d said Scott Pioli, an NFL Network analyst who worked in NFL front offices from 1992 to 2019, including winning three Super Bowls with New England before spending three years as general manager in Kansas City.",
      "\u201cJust because someone has immense talent doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re being brought into a circumstance or a situation that has all the right people, meaning coaches, front office. They don\u2019t necessarily have the right infrastructure.\u201d",
      "More from NFL draft",
      "Cam Ward could be the most unlikely No. 1 NFL draft pick ever He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "Cam Ward could be the most unlikely No. 1 NFL draft pick ever",
      "He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up",
      "Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "That variable makes it impossible to create a foolproof hiring process for any job in any NFL franchise, from the general manager to the nutritionist, said a longtime NFL scouting executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships within the league. Still, the executive acknowledged that quarterbacks endure a different, and deserved, level of scrutiny.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to put all this on the players. The environment is critical,\u201d the person said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a big, giant step in terms of the ability and talent level of guys that you\u2019re playing against. Combined with less time to practice the things that you need to practice, along with an impatient fan base, impatient owner, impatient everybody, it\u2019s a difficult world all around to really excel in.\u201d",
      "Quarterbacks have been sought-after for as long as football has existed, but the 2011 collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players union made good, younger starters even more valuable by lowering their cost. As the No. 1 pick in 2010, quarterback Sam Bradford earned $50 million guaranteed on a contract with a maximum value of $86 million. The next year, with new rookie-scale contracts in place, Newton went No. 1 on a deal paying him $22 million over four years. Last year\u2019s No. 1 pick, quarterback Caleb Williams, signed a four-year contract worth $39 million with the Chicago Bears.",
      "Purdy is the most recent and extreme example of a low-cost, high-reward draft pick. The 262nd and final pick of the 2022 draft, Purdy earned $870,000 while leading San Francisco to the Super Bowl in his second season \u2014 less than many of his starting-QB peers made in just a half of one game, according to ESPN calculations.",
      "That kind of potential upside often leads teams to \u201coverdraft\u201d quarterbacks, said Chris Simms, an NBC Sports analyst and former third-round selection at quarterback. A prospect might be ranked 45th among all players on a team\u2019s draft board yet be selected in the top 10 because of what he called a combination of the position\u2019s importance and a team\u2019s desperation.",
      "This year\u2019s quarterback draft class could offer a fascinating test case. Though Miami\u2019s Cam Ward is reportedly Tennessee\u2019s target at No. 1, at least one team\u2019s grade of Ward would have made him just the seventh-best QB in last year\u2019s class, and another team didn\u2019t give any of the available quarterbacks a first-round grade, according to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter. Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider cautioned people in February to be \u201ccareful\u201d not to describe this QB class as \u201cweak.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it depends on the team, the player, the quarterback, how you\u2019re going to acquire him, where you\u2019re going to acquire him,\u201d Schneider said.",
      "The foundation of a quarterback evaluation in 2025 looks similar to one from 50 years earlier. The first priority, Simms said, is whether a player has the physical tools. To Pioli, arm strength matters, but it isn\u2019t as dependable an indicator as accuracy and decision-making.",
      "\u201cYou could be really smart at the quarterback position, but can you make a good decision under duress when you\u2019re getting punched in the mouth?\u201d he said. \u201cThose things are very, very different.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, however, a data revolution has armed teams with more data than ever about draft prospects. Yet it hasn\u2019t moved them closer to cracking the code of how a particular player will perform in a team\u2019s particular environment, the longtime NFL scout said, because teams can interpret statistics, interviews, background checks and measurements in wildly different ways depending on the preferences or biases of an owner, a general manager or a coach.",
      "From 2000 to 2015, 15 quarterbacks drafted in the first round became franchise fixtures, starting at least 100 games in their careers. Yet in the same span, just as many first-rounders played fewer than 60 games. As recently as 2023, when four quarterbacks were taken in the first round, one (Houston\u2019s C.J. Stroud) has become a bona fide starter, while three others have struggled to establish themselves.",
      "Some teams lean more heavily on impressions from scouts, while others are driven by analytics departments. Teams can fall into the trap of overanalyzing a player\u2019s performance during the pre-draft process from January to April more than their on-field production. Simms believes an overreliance on analytics \u201chas actually confused people more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe great ones have great talent, and they have a charisma about them in the locker room,\u201d Simms said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking [John] Elway, [Dan] Marino, Peyton Manning, of course, Tom Brady, [Aaron] Rodgers, to where they can talk to anybody in the locker room and get them to follow and get the energy up on a daily basis in the locker room. And that\u2019s what the great ones have. And I think sometimes that gets lost in translation a little bit with all our other analytical tools we\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "The longtime NFL scouting executive said, \u201cIt always comes back to competitive confidence that I believe I can compete with anybody.\u201d",
      "Believing it would lend insights into the NFL draft, Pioli liked to learn how teams in other sports and corporations hired, too. With quarterbacks, he came to believe it was a numbers game.",
      "\u201cSmart teams realize, rather than hubris, there\u2019s humility, and they understand that they\u2019re going to get it wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you better take as many swings at it as you can.\u201d",
      "Pioli was in New England\u2019s draft room in 2000 when the Patriots took arguably the greatest quarterback swing in draft history by selecting Tom Brady with the 199th overall pick. Brady went on, of course, to author the most decorated career of any NFL quarterback. What stood out about Brady?",
      "\u201cWe had a lot of people involved in the process, but a couple of the things that I do remember coming up consistently was \u2018why does it seem that every time that Michigan wins, this is the guy that\u2019s playing quarterback?\u2019\u201d Pioli said. \u201cThat was pretty consistent. When Tommy played, they won. And that seems like a very simple thing, but it mattered.",
      "\u201cThe other thing was a group of people thought he was pretty darn accurate. Everyone that interfaced with him also felt like, you know, his work ethic and his overall makeup as a person was exactly what we wanted in our culture.\u201d"

      "Manhattan prosecutors painted a scathing portrait of Harvey Weinstein at the beginning of his sexual abuse retrial Wednesday, presenting the former Hollywood mogul as a serial predator who wielded his power like a weapon against women.",
      "Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey described Weinstein as an entertainment industry kingmaker who \u201cheld unfettered power for over 30 years\u201d and \u201cpreyed\u201d on women \u2014 including the three accusers whose allegations led to the criminal charges at the center of the trial.",
      "He \u201cwanted their bodies,\u201d Lucey said, referring to the alleged victims Mimi Haley, Kaja Sokola and Jessica Mann.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to two counts of criminal sexual act in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. He has vehemently denied all allegations of sexual misconduct dating back decades.",
      "Lucey, in her opening statement, described Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of the three accusers in stark and oftentimes graphic terms. She recounted allegations that Weinstein violently forced himself on them and ignored their pleas to stop.",
      "Lucey said Weinstein, \u201ca titan in the industry,\u201d drew in the women by offering to discuss their careers. But the accusers found that he was after something else entirely.",
      "\u201cHe knew how addictive Hollywood dreams were,\u201d Lucey said. \u201cHe knew how the promises of success worked. He strung them along with promises of careers, letters to help, parts in movies ... He simply did not take no for an answer and, if he was told no, he got what he wanted by force.\u201d",
      "Haley, a former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant, and Sokola, a former model, allege Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on them in separate incidents in 2006. Mann, a former aspiring actress, alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "The accusers discovered they were \u201cno match for the man who walked red carpets and rubbed elbows with the famous,\u201d Lucey said. \u201cThey stayed quiet for years,\u201d she added, out of \u201ctheir fear of what he might do to them.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidalia, forcefully pushed back against Lucey\u2019s account of events in his opening statement. \u201cWhat she said to you is not evidence,\u201d Aidalia told jurors at the beginning of his remarks.",
      "Aidalia implored jurors not to make premature judgements about Weinstein\u2019s character or behavior, drawing on an analogy from his client\u2019s former profession: \u201cYou don\u2019t judge a movie by the preview.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou need to read the whole book and watch the whole movie and put it all in context,\u201d Aidalia said, adding that his team believes \u201cthere are reasonable doubts\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "He went on to argue that Weinstein\u2019s sexual encounters with the accusers were \u201ctransactional,\u201d characterizing them as \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d arrangements that were \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and \u201cconsensual.\u201d",
      "In the case of the three women at the root of the charges, Aidalia added, \u201cthe casting couch is not a crime scene.\u201d",
      "The jury of seven women and five men appeared to listen intently during opening statements. In a statement, Weinstein\u2019s spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said his client\u2019s team believes \u201cthe jury selected is one that can assess the facts with clarity and impartiality.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are hopeful that this time, the legal process will rise above noise and narrative and allow Harvey Weinstein the fair trial he\u2019s long been denied. He deserves the chance to clear his name and preserve a legacy that has been overshadowed by deeply flawed and misleading accusations,\u201d Engelmayer said.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial arrives a year after New York\u2019s highest court overturned the Oscar-winning producer\u2019s conviction on third-degree rape in a 2020 case. The court found the trial judge had improperly allowed testimony based on allegations that were not part of the case.",
      "Haley's and Mann\u2019s allegations were part of the first New York trial. Sokola\u2019s allegations are a new element. Weinstein was indicted in September on charges related to her claims.",
      "Weinstein has remained in prison because he was convicted in 2022 of another rape in Los Angeles and sentenced to 16 years. The former producer\u2019s lawyers are appealing that conviction.",
      "In recent years, Weinstein has faced various health issues, including a diagnosis of bone marrow cancer. He arrives at court in a wheelchair.",
      "Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, once lorded over Hollywood. Miramax, their first distribution label, released seminal films such as \u201cThe Crying Game\u201d and \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d Harvey Weinstein won an Oscar as a producer of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d In the early 2010s, the brothers\u2019 second distribution firm scored best picture wins for \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s reign came crashing down in 2017 after The New York Times and The New Yorker published exposes detailing his alleged pattern of sexual harassment and assault.",
      "The publication of those articles made Weinstein\u2019s accusers realize they no longer needed to keep in their \u201cshame and pain,\u201d Lucey said, adding: \u201cThey suddenly realized they were not alone, they would not be isolated or targeted but would be taken seriously.\"",
      "In all, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said his sexual encounters were consensual."

    "story": [
      "HUNTSVILLE, Texas  \u2014 A Texas man convicted of fatally strangling and stabbing a young mother more than 20 years ago was executed Wednesday evening.",
      "Moises Sandoval Mendoza received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville and was pronounced dead at 6:40 p.m., authorities said. He was condemned for the March 2004 killing of 20-year-old Rachelle O\u2019Neil Tolleson.",
      "Prosecutors say Mendoza, 41, took Tolleson from her north Texas home, leaving her 6-month-old daughter alone. The infant was found cold and wet but safe the next day by Tolleson\u2019s mother. Tolleson\u2019s body was discovered six days later, left in a field near a creek.",
      "Evidence in Mendoza\u2019s case showed he also burned Tolleson\u2019s body to hide his fingerprints. Dental records were used to identify her, according to investigators.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order that rejected all of Mendoza\u2019s appeals to block the lethal injection from proceeding. Lower courts had previously rejected his petitions for a stay. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Mendoza\u2019s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "In their petition before the Supreme Court, Mendoza\u2019s attorneys said he was prevented by lower courts from arguing that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel earlier in the appeals process.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s attorneys allege that a previous appeals attorney, as well as his trial lawyer, had failed to challenge critical testimony by a detention officer, Robert Hinton. That testimony was used by prosecutors to convince jurors that Mendoza would be a future danger to society \u2014 a legal finding needed to secure a death sentence in Texas.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s lawyers allege the officer, who worked in the county jail where the inmate was being held after his arrest, gave false testimony that Mendoza had started a fight with another inmate. Mendoza\u2019s lawyers say the other inmate now claims in an affidavit that he believed detention officers wanted him to start the fight, and he was later rewarded for it.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt the jury was listening. During its deliberations, the jury specifically asked about Mendoza\u2019s \u2018criminal acts while in jail,\u2019 including the \u2018assault on other inmate,\u2019\u201d Mendoza\u2019s lawyers said in their petition to the Supreme Court. \u201cAs evidenced by the jury\u2019s notes, there is a reasonable probability that trial counsel\u2019s error in failing to investigate Hinton\u2019s testimony affected the result.\u201d",
      "But the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office told the Supreme Court that Mendoza\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has already been found by a lower federal court to be \u201cmeritless and insubstantial.\u201d",
      "Even if the detention officer\u2019s testimony were eliminated, the jury heard substantial evidence regarding Mendoza\u2019s future dangerousness and his long history of violence, especially against women, including physically attacking his mother and sister and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cFinally, given the extreme delay in this two-decade-old case, the public interest weighs heavily against a stay. The State and crime victims have a \u2019powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty,\u2019\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said in its petition.",
      "Authorities said that in the days before the killing, Mendoza had attended a party at Tolleson\u2019s home in Farmersville, about 45 miles  northeast of Dallas. On the day her body was found, Mendoza told a friend about the killing. The friend called police and Mendoza was arrested.",
      "Mendoza confessed to police but couldn\u2019t give detectives a reason for his actions, authorities said. He told investigators he repeatedly choked Tolleson, sexually assaulted her and dragged her body to a field, where he choked her again and then stabbed her in the throat. He later moved her body to a more remote location and burned it.",
      "If the execution is carried out, Mendoza would be the third inmate put to death this year in Texas, historically the nation\u2019s busiest capital punishment state, and the 13th in the U.S.",
      "On Thursday, Alabama planned to execute James Osgood for the 2010 rape and murder of a woman."

      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",

A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",

    "summary": "More than a dozen senior lawyers in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \u2013 many with decades of experience \u2013 have been reassigned.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has quietly transformed the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, forcing out a majority of career managers and implementing new priorities that current and former officials say abandon a decadeslong mission of enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination in hiring, housing and voting rights.",
      "More than a dozen senior lawyers \u2014 many with decades of experience working under presidents of both parties \u2014\u00a0have been reassigned, the current and former officials say.\u00a0Some have resigned in frustration after they were moved to less desirable roles unrelated to their expertise, according to the sources.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a complete bloodbath,\u201d said a senior Justice Department lawyer in the division who is not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Last week, President Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked head of the division issued a series of memos outlining priorities that are dramatically at odds with the way both Republican and Democratic administrations have enforced civil rights law \u2014 including the first Trump administration.",
      "Rather than focusing on enforcing federal laws against discrimination, the division is now charged with pursuing priorities laid out in a series of Trump\u2019s executive orders, including \u201cKeeping Men out of Women's Sports\u201d and \u201cEnding Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,\u201d according to the memos, which were issued by division head Harmeet Dhillon and obtained by NBC News.",
      "Dhillon is a\u00a0conservative culture warrior\u00a0who represented Trump in challenging the results of the 2020 election and ardently backed his baseless claims of fraud.",
      "The changes have not been publicly announced by the Justice Department. Reuters first reported some of them Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a 180 shift from the division\u2019s traditional mission,\u201d said a former senior official in the division who declined to be named in fear of retaliation.",
      "\"These documents appear to have been created in a vacuum completely divorced from reality,\" the former official said. \"The division can only enforce statutes that have been passed by Congress, and these orders seem to contemplate division attorneys\u2019 executing on work that fundamentally departs from the division\u2019s long-standing mission.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Dhillon portrayed the changes as a normal shift of emphasis in a new administration, as well as a quest for efficiency.",
      "\u201cEach new administration has its own priorities, and allocates resources accordingly,\" Dhillon said. \"The Trump administration is no different. When I assumed my duties as Assistant Attorney General, I learned that certain sections in Civil Rights had substantial existing caseloads and backlogs, and that formed the basis of temporary details to assist those sections in getting, and staying, caught up.\"",
      "She added: \u201cThe Civil Rights Division looks forward to continuing to\u00a0aggressively\u00a0protecting\u00a0the civil rights of Americans.\"",
      "NBC News spoke to 10 current and former employees of the Civil Rights Division for this article, as well as other sources familiar with the Justice Department\u2019s operations.\u00a0Most declined to be identified, citing fear of retaliation.",
      "The sources say many of the division\u2019s section chiefs have been transferred to roles unrelated to their legal backgrounds, including in the complaint adjudication office and the office that handles public records requests.",
      "\u201cEvery presidential administration has its own policy priorities,\" said Stacey Young, who spent 18 years in the division before resigning in January, \"but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any precedent for an administration almost completely refocusing the civil rights division\u2019s enforcement priorities the way this one has.\"",
      "\"The loss is truly hard to quantify,\" added Young, who co-founded Justice Connection, a group now trying to highlight Trump administration changes to the Justice Department. \"Vital civil rights work is not going to get done.\"",
      "The overhaul of the Civil Rights Division is a microcosm of what has been happening across the federal government, as the Trump administration has removed nonpartisan civil servants and dismantled or reoriented federal agencies with a speed and an audacity that few thought was possible.\u00a0Similar changes have been happening to a lesser degree at other Justice Department offices, current and former officials say. But they say the extent of the repurposing of the Civil Rights Division stands out.",
      "Founded in 1957 after the passage of the 20th\u00a0century\u2019s first major civil rights legislation, the Civil Rights Division has always been subject to the policy preferences of the president, and enforcement priorities tend to differ in Republican and Democratic administrations.\u00a0But there is no precedent for the changes that have been made over the last three months, which are far more consequential than anything that occurred in Trump\u2019s first term, current and former officials say.",
      "\u201cI was there almost 18 years, and what\u2019s happening now is basically the opposite of what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d said a veteran lawyer who recently left the department. \u201cIn the first Trump administration, they engaged with us as attorneys.\u00a0The political appointees were normal lawyers.\u00a0Sometimes we persuaded them and sometimes they disagreed, but there was always a conversation about why and what the law required. That is not happening.\u201d",
      "In the Biden administration, the Civil Rights Division convicted 180 police officers of violating people\u2019s civil rights, according to Justice Department records.\u00a0It also prosecuted a variety of high-profile hate crimes cases, including one against the Texas man who targeted Mexicans when he killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso and the Pennsylvania man who killed 11 congregants at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.",
      "Among the many settlements over racial discrimination, the division secured reforms at Hawkins County Schools in Tennessee, where an investigation found that incidents of harassment \u2014 including a mock \u201cslave auction\u201d to sell Black students to their white counterparts and a \u201cmonkey of the month\u201d campaign to ridicule Black students \u2014 created a racially hostile environment. On voting rights, the division\u00a0successfully challenged\u00a0an Arizona law requiring people registering to vote to list their birthplaces and provide proof of citizenship.",
      "Current and former employees say many of those enforcement actions are unimaginable under the new regime.",
      "\u201cThey are withdrawing everything we\u2019ve done and taking the opposite side on voting rights, for example,\u201d said a recently departed Civil Division lawyer. \u201cThis is not \u2018Oh, we want to do more religion cases\u2019 or \u2018We don\u2019t want to do creative redlining cases.\u2019 This is abandoning everything that we have done in the past.\u00a0They are actively anti-civil rights. This didn\u2019t happen in Trump 1.\u201d",
      "Dhillon took office April 7, but the changes had already been underway.\u00a0So far the Civil Rights Division has suspended investigations of police abuse and launched probes into whether Los Angeles is\u00a0violating people\u2019s gun rights and whether American universities are\u00a0tolerating antisemitism.\u00a0The division was also involved in the\u00a0lawsuit filed last week accusing the state of Maine of violating the law by allowing transgender athletes to participate on women\u2019s sports teams.",
      "At the same time, current and former officials say, the managerial jobs vacated in recent weeks have not been filled, so the traditional work of the division has all but stopped.",
      "\u201cIf regular Americans think that this administration is going to protect their rights, they\u2019re just wrong,\" a recently departed division lawyer said.",
      "In their\u00a0Project 2025 blueprint, conservative Trump backers wrote that Trump should \u201creorganize and refocus the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division to serve as the vanguard\u201d for what they called a \u201creturn to lawfulness.\u201d",
      "\u201cEntities across the private and public sectors in the United States have been besieged in recent years by an unholy alliance of special interests, radicals in government, and the far Left,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis unholy alliance speaks in platitudes about advancing the interests of certain segments of American society, but that advancement comes at the expense of other Americans and in nearly all cases violates long-standing federal law.\u201d",
      "Dhillon\u2019s memos, issued last week, laid out a sweeping set of new priorities.",
      "The Federal Coordination and Compliance Section, for example, had been tasked with enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by preventing and remedying discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion and shared ancestry in federally funded programs across the country.",
      "Dhillon\u2019s memo says the section now has new priorities, not mentioned in the 1964 law but outlined in Trump\u2019s executive orders, including those on \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism,\u201d \u201cRestoring Merit Based Opportunity\u201d and \u201cDesignating English as the Official Language of the United States.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi hosted a meeting of a new Trump administration task force on \u201cEradicating Anti-Christian Bias.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "Democratic attorneys general from 12 states filed a joint lawsuit arguing that the president does not have the constitutional authority to execute his sweeping tariff agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Twelve states filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the legality of President Donald Trump's broad tariff agenda, arguing it unlawfully undermines Congress' constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce.",
      "The legal challenge, led by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, seeks to halt the enforcement of the global tariffs Trump levied that invoked a wartime law granting presidents the power to oversee trade if the United States is in a state of emergency.",
      "\"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" said the complaint Democratic attorneys general filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Mayes said in a statement announcing the lawsuit, \u201cTrump\u2019s insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless \u2014 it is illegal.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, a frequent target of Trump's attacks, argued that the tariffs \"will lead to more inflation, unemployment, and economic damage\" and that U.S. consumers will be forced to foot the bill for what amount to high import taxes.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai said: \u201cOnce again, Democrats like Letitia James are prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing\u2014both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit,\u201d Desai added.",
      "The lawsuit cites four tariff-focused executive orders signed by Trump. Each one invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants presidents permission to make trade decisions without congressional approval under declarations of national emergencies.",
      "\u201cThe purported \u2018unusual and extraordinary threat\u2019 identified by President Trump as \u2018national emergencies\u2019 do not amount to emergencies. Nor are they extraordinary or even unusual,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Without proper emergency justification for using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the lawsuit says, the Trump administration is violating Congress\u2019 \u201cpower to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises,\u201d as delegated by Article 1 of the Constitution.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to justify its recent tariffs on key U.S. trading partners by declaring various emergencies it argued the countries were at fault for causing.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid a bipartisan push in Congress to put broad trade authority back in the hands of the legislative branch. Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who are on the Senate Finance Committee, have co-sponsored a bill that would require the president to notify Congress 48 hours before imposing new tariffs."

      "\u201cPresident Beilock does not believe that signing open form letters like this one is an effective way to defend Dartmouth\u2019s mission and values,\u201d university spokesperson Kathryn Kennedy said in an email.",
      "More than 300 university and college presidents co-signed Tuesday's letter, which condemns the Trump administration for following through on threats to pause billions of dollars in federal grants and research funding, in part to change schools\u2019 policies and punish them for their handling of student protests.",
      "Cuts targeting Harvard and Columbia came after allegations of antisemitism arose following last year\u2019s student protests against Israel\u2019s military action in the Gaza Strip.",
      "College campuses across the United States erupted in protests a year ago as Israel continued to pound the Gaza Strip to root out Hamas fighters who carried out the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel.",

      "Senate Democratic retirements clear the way for a new generation",
      "A growing number of Democrats in the Senate are stepping aside and clearing the way for the next generation of leaders as the party debates its path forward in the Trump 2.0 era.",
      "The latest example came Wednesday, when Sen. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber, announced he will not seek re-election in 2026 after having served in Congress for more than four decades, Sahil Kapur, Ben Kamisar and Bridget Bowman report. The decision will set off a scramble for his leadership posts in the Senate \u2014 he\u2019s the minority whip and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \u2014 as well as for his seat in solidly blue Illinois.",
      "Already, a bevy of prominent Democrats in the state have signaled their interest in replacing the Durbin, 80. Reps. Lauren Underwood (age 38), Raja Krishnamoorthi (51) and Robin Kelly (68) and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton (59) are all considering bids, according to sources familiar with their thinking. The winner of the Democratic primary would be a heavy favorite in the general election.",
      "Durbin is the fourth Senate Democrat to announce retirement plans ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, along with Gary Peters of Michigan, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Tina Smith of Minnesota, who have similarly seen a wave of younger candidates jump into the races to succeed them.",
      "Michigan: The Democratic primary for the seat held by Peters (66) has quickly become crowded. Rep. Haley Stevens (41) is the latest candidate to jump in, joining state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (38) and former Wayne County health director Abdul El-Sayed (40).",
      "It\u2019s expected to be one of the most competitive Democratic primaries in the country next year. And it is likely to lead to one of the most competitive general election matchups, too, with former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers (61) running again after having narrowly lost the Senate race in the state last year.",
      "New Hampshire: Rep. Chris Pappas (44) is the early Democratic favorite in the primary to replace Shaheen (78).",
      "Minnesota: After Smith (67) announced her retirement, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan (45) and former state Senate Democratic leader Melisa L\u00f3pez Franzen (44) launched their primary campaigns, while Rep. Angie Craig (53) is considering a bid.",
      "Those states will be more competitive in a general election than Illinois, so securing the Democratic nomination won\u2019t provide a glide path to the Senate. But the open-seat primaries could pave the way for the sort of youth movement some Democrats have argued is needed to reinvigorate the party ahead of the 2026 and 2028 elections.",
      "Side note: Democrats will also aim to defend the youngest member of the Senate next year: 38-year-old Jon Ossoff of Georgia is expected to be Republicans\u2019 top target on the map.",
      "U.S. peace plan leaves Ukraine on edge",
      "U.S. peace talks to end the war in Ukraine appear to be near collapse, with President Donald Trump lashing out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not accepting a U.S. proposal that is widely viewed as favoring Russia.",
      "The U.S. plan would let Russia keep Crimea, Ukrainian territory that Russia occupied in 2014, and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. In a one-two punch, Vice President JD Vance, traveling in India, threatened that the United States would walk away from the talks if the two sides didn\u2019t accept the U.S. terms, which would be a territorial and military victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Zelenskyy told The Wall Street Journal that giving up Crimea would violate Ukraine\u2019s constitution. And he asked what concessions Russia would make if Ukraine gave up hopes of becoming a member of NATO. While Zelenskyy has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, Russia has not.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were to hold talks Wednesday with Ukraine, England, Germany and France in London, but Rubio and Witkoff canceled at the last minute. That led European foreign ministers to also drop out, downgrading the talks to a meeting of technical experts.",
      "\u201cIf at some point we determine that if we\u2019re just too far apart and not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities, because there are a lot of important things happening in the world,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis is not our war. We didn\u2019t start this war.\u201d",
      "Trying to smooth over the impasse, Zelenskyy said later in a statement: \u201cEmotions have run high today. But it is good that 5 countries met to bring peace closer. ... The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace.\u201d",
      "The White House says Witkoff will go to Moscow this week for his fourth meeting with Putin. Trump had promised he would end the war within 24 hours of taking office.",

      "\u201cI just thought about actually who I wanted to see in my most vulnerable state,\u201d Wade said. \u201cAnd it was my dad. I wanted my wife to see me when I woke up, I wanted her to be the first person I saw, but in my most vulnerable state, when I was probably as scared as I\u2019ve ever been, I wanted my dad to be there. I was like, \u2018I need my dad.\u2019\u201d",
      "Dwyane Wade Sr. also had endured a cancer diagnosis of his own, which further bonded the father and son.",
      "\u201cMy dad shared with me when he was going through prostate cancer, and I think we got closer through that process because I (was) obviously concerned about him, but we started communicating more because this was something that was a part of our genetic genes as men in our family,\u201d Wade said.",
      "\u201cAnd so we started being able to share personal things,\u201d he continued. \u201cLike, I would call my dad after I left the hospital, like, \u2018Yo, I just got a prostate exam, Pops, and the doctor did this,\u2019 and he\u2019ll laugh and say, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s nothing. She just wanted to do this.\u2019 We just got close when his prostate cancer (was being treated).\u201d",
      "Wade\u00a0said on \"TODAY\"\u00a0on March 11 that a crucial reason his cancer was detected in the first place was because he went to see his doctor for a checkup in the wake of his father\u2019s prostate cancer diagnosis.",
      "It led to further testing in which Wade said his doctors found a 3-centimeter mass on his right kidney that was Stage 1 cancer. It was removed in December 2023 in a surgery during which Wade was accompanied by his father.",
      "Dwyane Wade Sr. has been a constant source of strength for his son from the beginning, which included helping him develop a passion for basketball growing up in Chicago.",
      "\u201cHe channeled his love of sport into his son,\u201d Wade said. \u201cHe channeled it into me, and he took me, like, literally everywhere with him. And so I fell in love with sport. I fell in love with competition. I fell in love with camaraderie.\u201d",
      "The elder Wade is a military veteran who also instilled a sense of discipline and responsibility in Dwyane Jr. at a young age.",
      "\u201cMy father would get up every day at 5 a.m., and I would have to get up every day at 5 a.m. with him because he would make me iron his clothes before he went to work,\u201d Wade said.",
      "He said he even drove his father to the train station for work when Wade was only 12 years old.",
      "\u201cMy dad saw something and he was putting something in me and a lot of responsibilities on me,\u201d Wade said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019ve been getting up at 5 a.m. since I was, like, 9 years old.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy dad was an amazing father, and he was there,\u201d Wade said later in the podcast. \u201cHe showed up. He instilled things in us. Like I said, he was very militant, so a lot of ways that I am, when I say I\u2019m OCD, a lot of that comes from my dad \u2014 make your bed, wash the dishes.\u201d"

      "Fans who\u2019ve been following \u201cYou\u201d (which is based on Caroline Kepnes\u2019 novels) for the last four seasons know that our pouty, floppy-haired protagonist Joe (Penn Badgley) seems like a real catch at first. He\u2019s handsome, he loves books, he\u2019s super-supportive of women (in his own particular way) \u2014 he\u2019s a wannabe hero with lots of family damage.",
      "But the other side to him is one giant red flag: He kind of likes killing people, and has a tendency to lock ladies who thwart or threaten him in a soundproofed, clear cage (which traditionally lives in the basement of a used bookstore).",
      "Season 5, which premieres April 24, is set to conclude Joe\u2019s adventures, which have included both a significant body count and an international tour of New York, London, Paris and Los Angeles, so expect a big blowout of some sort.",
      "\u201cEvery season they manage to find new space to make it interesting and relevant,\u201d\u00a0Badgley told Netflix\u2019s Tudum\u00a0blog recently. \u201cAnd this season, I think somehow coming back to where it started allowed for it to just become grounded in the way that it needs to also have this kind of spectacular finish.\u201d",
      "So before the final ten episodes drop, let\u2019s jaunt back to 2023\u2019s Season 4. What was Joe\u2019s reign of terror in the UK like?",
      "Where was Joe at the start of Season 4?",
      "With his wife Love (Victoria Pedretti) dead and his daughter Henry parked with friends, Joe made it to London and somehow landed a job as a university professor, calling himself Jonathan Moore. He clicked with a few students, including Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman), who gave him a book from rising political figure Rhys Montrose (Ed Speleers).",
      "But it doesn\u2019t take long for Joe to slip, even when he\u2019s promising to be better. He loathed Malcolm (Stephen Hagan), who helped him secure the teaching position, and coveted Malcolm\u2019s art expert girlfriend Kate (Charlotte Ritchie).",
      "Both Malcolm and Kate were filthy rich, and after Joe saved Kate from being robbed (his stalking does come in handy once in a while), Joe was included in their inner circle of wealthy ne\u2019er-do-wells, influencers, and nepo babies. Why couldn\u2019t he just find a nice book club?",
      "Surrounded by jerks again, Joe reverted to form and bodies began to fall. He started getting text messages from the \u201cEat-the-Rich Killer.\u201d",
      "Joe initially thought the killer was Rhys Montrose \u2014 who he met and had a fine conversation with at a bar Kate and Malcolm\u2019s friends hung out at \u2014 but twist, Rhys wasn\u2019t real!",
      "That is, Rhys Montrose was real and an author/politician, but Joe\u2019s mind had begun playing tricks on him, creating an \u201cinner\u201d Rhys he could blame some of the murders on, like Malcolm\u2019s.",
      "So long, Marienne: Joe\u2019s flashback girlfriend",
      "Marienne (Tati Gabrielle) was the former librarian and single mom Joe tanked his relationship with Love for. At the end of Season 3, Love convinced Marienne to flee because of Joe\u2019s murderous tendencies, and after a stint in London, Marienne ended up in Paris with her daughter.",
      "Joe tracked her down, but when she threatened him with a knife \u2014 he let her go, insisting he could be a better person.",
      "Another mind-twist! In reality, Joe put her in his cage (which came with him to \u2026 London?) and left her there as his mind flapped between Good Joe and Bad Joe. But when Joe\u2019s nosy student Nadia discovered Marienne in the cage, the women contrived a way for Marienne to fake her death. Once Joe was sure Marienne had died in the cage, he decided to do something nice for her \u2026 and left her body on a bench to be discovered. But Nadia came along to wake her up and Marienne was free!",
      "Joe\u2019s next victim \u2014 er, girlfriend: Kate",
      "Kate did mourn Malcolm, but Joe slowly won her over, insisting (rightly so) that she should get away from her parasitical friend group. Over time, they revealed some of their dirty secrets to one another, and grew closer.",
      "But when Love popped up in Joe\u2019s dreams, he took a deeper look inside himself and realized\u00a0he\u00a0was the Eat-the-Rich killer, and that he had in fact kidnapped Marienne. The only way to end the cycle, he decided, was to end himself. He jumped into a river and was saved by police. In the hospital he came clean to Kate about his past, and no longer felt guilty about the occasional murder he had to commit. He was ready to start his life anew \u2014 with her.",
      "Kate helped Joe clean up his past, and they began a full-fledged love affair of damaged equals. But Nadia and another student, Eddie (Brad Alexander), were still investigating Joe and trying to expose him. So Joe killed Eddie and handed a shocked Nadia the murder weapon, effectively framing her. Nadia refused to speak in her own defense, and Kate and Joe walked away with clean hands, if not quite clean hearts.",
      "Season 5 of \u201cYou\u201d returns to Netflix on April 24."

      "As the Trump administration renews its focus on declining birth rates in the U.S., new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that births were fairly stable in 2024, rising 1% over the year prior.",
      "There were 3,622,673 births in the U.S. last year, according to a CDC report released Wednesday. Overall, the number of births declined by 2% per year, on average, from 2015 through 2020 and fluctuated in the years since, according to the report.",
      "The report also estimated the birth rate among women ages 15 to 44, referred to more specifically as the fertility rate.\u00a0The rate declined from 2014 to 2020, then fluctuated through 2024. The fertility rate last year was 54.6 births per 1,000 women, the report found \u2014 a 0.2% uptick compared with 2023.",
      "Brady Hamilton, the report\u2019s main author and a CDC statistician, said the data marks \u201ca continuation of the general downward trend in births to teenagers and upward trend in births to older women seen for the last three or so decades.\u201d However, he said the CDC could not speak to the reasons behind the trend.",
      "Sociologists who examined the CDC data said it largely reflects women who delayed having children in their 20s finally choosing to do so in their 30s and 40s. Birth rates increased last year among women ages 25 to 44, but declined among teenagers and those under 25.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that people are deciding against having kids at all,\u201d said Karen Benjamin Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",
      "Rather, she said, people are asking themselves: \u201cDo I have the right partner? If I have another baby in child care, what would that do to my expenses? Does my job feel stable?\u201d",
      "Those same concerns might also compel parents to have fewer children, Guzzo said. The average woman in 2024 had one to two biological children, according to the CDC report, compared with more than three in 1960.",
      "The overall fertility rate in the U.S. has declined since 2007 \u2014 a pattern sociologists expect to continue, despite the nominal uptick last year.",
      "While the economy has generally improved since the \u201cGreat Recession,\u201d many people still don\u2019t feel like their financial position has gotten better, said Sarah Hayford, director of the Institute for Population Research at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of places, the housing market is really challenging, and that\u2019s something that a lot of people want to have kind of in place before they have children,\u201d she said.",
      "Guzzo said the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imported goods and gutting of federal programs that support women and children could add to a climate of women delaying having kids or deciding not to altogether.",
      "The Trump administration, for its part, has lamented the decline in birth rates.",
      "Vice President JD Vance called for \u201cmore babies in the United States of America\u201d at an anti-abortion rally in January. And Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that same month that communities with higher-than-average marriage and birth rates should be prioritized for federal transportation funds.",
      "President Donald Trump dubbed himself \u201cthe fertilization president\u201d at a White House event in March. His executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization emphasizes \u201cthe importance of family formation\u201d and calls for making it easier \u201cfor loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children.\u201d",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a senior Trump adviser, has also referred to declining birth rates as a danger to humanity\u2019s survival. According to the CDC report, the birth rate in the U.S. is far below what\u2019s known as the \u201creplacement level,\u201d where enough babies are being born that a population can keep its size from one generation to the next.",
      "The New York Times reported Monday that the White House is weighing proposals to incentivize childbirth, including a $5,000 cash bonus to mothers after delivery. But sociologists said those efforts aren\u2019t likely to reverse declining birth rates. A 2021 study of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d in South Korea found that most of the money went to women who would have had a child regardless of the incentive.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just flip a switch and change the birth rate,\u201d said Julia Strasser, an assistant research professor at the George Washington University Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity.",
      "\u201cThe economic requirements \u2014 not just for having babies, but for raising babies \u2014 last a very long time, and $5,000 doesn\u2019t really go a long way towards supporting that,\u201d she added.",
      "Sociologists generally agreed that low fertility or birth rates aren\u2019t an inherent problem. In fact, they said, the decline in teen birth rates is a positive trend.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good news when people can avoid having kids at periods of their life where they themselves would say, \u2018This is not the right time,\u2019\u201d Guzzo said."

While the Giants need help all over the roster, New York's deciding to forgo a quarterback could speak to the lack of faith in passing prospects in this year\u2019s class.",
      "New York is seemingly set at the QB position in the short term after it signed Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson this offseason. But as the saying goes, if you have two quarterbacks, then you have none.",
      "So, where will Sanders go?",
      "Sanders is sure to draw a lot of intrigue and interest wherever he lands. Though he\u2019s seemingly not a sure bet to go in the first round, there is one popular destination for the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders: the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
      "ESPN and Sharp Football both have the Steelers selecting Sanders with the 21st pick in the first round, though Dvorchak, The Ringer and Yahoo disagree. (Yahoo\u2019s Charles McDonald and Nate Tice notably have Pittsburgh taking Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe.)",
      "The lack of clarity on Sanders is instructive about this draft as a whole. Outside of Ward, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a quarterback everyone can agree on.",
      "At the same time, teams often get desperate when it comes to finding a player at the sport\u2019s most important position. That means whether it\u2019s Sanders, Milroe or someone else, one organization could be taking a massive swing whenever the second quarterback of the draft is ultimately selected.",
      "Will there be trades?",
      "Perhaps the most difficult part of the draft to anticipate is which teams will trade up or down. Is there a prospect someone has fallen in love with and has to go get? Is there a team with too many needs that has to amass picks?",
      "The Cleveland Browns, for example, have long been connected to Hunter with the second pick, but they may also be a trade candidate.",
      "One player who could cause movement alone is Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty, who is mocked by many to go early in the first round, anywhere from five to 10.",
      "Which teams will be aggressive? We\u2019re close to finding out all the answers."

Natalia\u2019s not the first person we\u2019ve brought in our house like that.\u201d",
      "Mans described in the same interview how she and her husband first encountered Grace. She says a concerned neighbor reached out to them shortly after Grace\u2019s former adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, left Grace living alone in an apartment.",
      "\u201cMy friend called me and was like, \u2018You need to come down here right away.\u2019 So I go over there and she\u2019s like, she\u2019s telling me she\u2019s 22. I mean, look at her, she\u2019s not 22,\u201d Mans said in the \u201cDr. Phil\u201d interview.",
      "Grace said in the same interview that she was 8 years old when the Barnetts left her and moved to Canada with their biological son. She told Dr. Phil she had already been living alone in a different apartment for about a year before being moved to the apartment where she met the Manses, which the document from the Court of Appeals of Indiana also states.",
      "\u201cShe took me over to her house and it was definitely her apartment. She had a bed in there, she had a TV, she had some boxed food in her freezer,\u201d Cynthia Mans recalled in the \u201cDr. Phil\u201d interview.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, you know, I have a couple kids at home. Come on down, you can play with them, talk with us, whatever,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cSo she came to our house and hung out down there, and she never left. She\u2019s been with us ever since.\u201d",
      "Mans added that she believes the Barnetts tried to change Grace\u2019s age and falsely portray her as having psychological issues because they viewed her as a \u201cburden.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible that they\u2019re trying to make her out to be this monster,\u201d she said.",
      "What happened between Natalia Grace and Cynthia and Antwon Mans?",
      "Grace lived with the Manses for about a decade. During that time, Cynthia Mans says Grace formed a close bond with her adoptive siblings.",
      "\u201cWe have other children. We have a grandson. She does nothing but love her siblings and her nephew,\u201d Mans said in the family\u2019s 2019 \u201cDr. Phil\u201d interview.",
      "Mans said Grace had been in the delivery room when one of her brothers was born. She also said that over the years, Grace helped care for her younger siblings, giving them baths, changing diapers, and making up bottles.",
      "Cynthia Mans and her husband charged Grace $250 per month in rent, Mans testified during the 2022 trial of Michael and Kristine Barnett, who faced multiple charges related to their neglect of Grace, according to the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals. (Michael Barnett was later acquitted and the charges against Kristine Barnett were dropped. TODAY.com has previously reached out to Michael and Kristine Barnett for comment).",
      "The Manses filed a court petition seeking guardianship of Grace in 2016. This petition was unsuccessful, but they were eventually able to formally adopt Grace in 2023.",
      "In recent years, the Manses were shown supporting Grace as she fought to prove that she had been a little girl when she was adopted by the Barnetts, not a grown woman pretending to be a child.",
      "In one scene from a multi-part Investigation Discovery documentary \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace,\u201d which came out between 2023 and 2025, Antwon Mans is shown offering moral support to Grace as she learns the results of a DNA test confirming her approximate age.",
      "He is also shown consoling Grace following a confrontation between her and her former adoptive father, Michael Barnett.",
      "What happened between Natalia Grace and the Manses?",
      "While it appears the Manses once shared a close bond with Grace, their relationship seemed to sour in 2023.",
      "That year, the couple called the producers of \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace\u201d and said there was a \u201csituation\u201d with Grace.",
      "\u201cSomething ain\u2019t right with Natalia,\u201d Antwon Mans said on the call, a recording of which was included in a later installment of the documentary.",
      "\u201cNatalia does not have emotions for nothing but herself,\u201d he also said. \u201cWe\u2019re done. We\u2019re done with her.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Mans claimed Grace was being manipulated by her boyfriend, a man called Neil living in the U.K. whom Grace had met online.",
      "\u201cThis guy just completely flipped Natalia\u2019s mind against her family,\u201d Cynthia Mans said in the documentary. \u201cAnd he convinced Natalia that what he was saying was right and we were wrong.\u201d",
      "Neil reached out to the DePauls, a couple with dwarfism in New York, who had considered adopting Grace before the Barnetts. Nicole DePaul told People and said he felt Natalia was in danger.",
      "\u201cIt was probably a month of communicating with him daily and he was communicating with her \u2014 then I knew we had to do something,\u201d Nicole DePaul told People.",
      "In the documentary \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace,\u201d friends and neighbors alleged that the Manses had physically abused Grace and other adoptive children,",
      "In the docuseries, Grace declined to comment on these accusations. When a producer asked Grace if she was hit by the Manses, she said, \u201cNot anything crazy. Maybe a little pop on the butt or something.\u201d",
      "The Manses have not responded to earlier requests for comment from TODAY.com about the allegations raised in the documentary.",
      "In late 2023, Grace left the Manses\u2019 home and moved in with Nicole and Vince DePaul, and their teenage daughter, Mackenzie, in upstate New York.",
      "She has lived with the DePauls since then, and has said she is working on becoming more independent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a big learning curve for me. For the most part, I\u2019ve made peace. It is definitely a blessing to be alive today,\u201d Grace told People in January. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the past.\u201d",
      "Where is Cynthia Mans now?",
      "It is unclear whether Cynthia Mans is in contact with Natalia Grace today.",
      "In April, Mans appeared to address the way her family\u2019s story is portrayed on \u201cGood American Family.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmazing how ppl take 30 minutes of tv and cast judgment on my family,\u201d reads an April 3 postfrom a TikTok page called Cynthia Mans and Fam, which is linked to the Mans family\u2019s Instagram page.",
      "\u201cWe never harmed a hair on Natalyahs head,\u201d the post continues. \u201cThat little girl we took care of her for 11 years. I am the one who seen her took her in and loved her despite what others said. Yall on these apps need to think before you open your mouth.\u201d",
      "In January 2024, the same TikTok page appearing to belong to Cynthia Mans shared an updateabout Grace\u2019s social media activity.",
      "\u201cHello everyone. This is no longer Natalyah Mans page,\u201d the post reads. \u201cShe has her own page now. I wanted to put this out there again so no one thinks I\u2019m trying to get followers by using her name. I appreciate you all.\u201d",
      "The Mans family\u2019s Instagram page has not been updated since 2023, when the family shared a Thanksgiving photo of Grace and their other children.",
      "Several earlier photos of Grace are still up on the page, including one selfie from August 2023 showing Grace and Cynthia Mans posing for a selfie.",
      "\u201cGod is doing His thing!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f,\u201d reads the caption, along with the hashtags #mommydaughterlove and #bestfriends."

      "Parents, hide your daughters: Joe Goldberg is coming back for a fifth and final season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cYou,\u201d and let\u2019s just say that no one is safe from the cage in the basement.",
      "Fans who\u2019ve been following \u201cYou\u201d (which is based on Caroline Kepnes\u2019 novels) for the last four seasons know that our pouty, floppy-haired protagonist Joe (Penn Badgley) seems like a real catch at first. He\u2019s handsome, he loves books, he\u2019s super-supportive of women (in his own particular way) \u2014 he\u2019s a wannabe hero with lots of family damage.",
      "But the other side to him is one giant red flag: He kind of likes killing people, and has a tendency to lock ladies who thwart or threaten him in a soundproofed, clear cage (which traditionally lives in the basement of a used bookstore).",
      "Season 5, which premieres April 24, is set to conclude Joe\u2019s adventures, which have included both a significant body count and an international tour of New York, London, Paris and Los Angeles, so expect a big blowout of some sort.",
      "\u201cEvery season they manage to find new space to make it interesting and relevant,\u201d Badgley told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog recently. \u201cAnd this season, I think somehow coming back to where it started allowed for it to just become grounded in the way that it needs to also have this kind of spectacular finish.\u201d",
      "So before the final ten episodes drop, let\u2019s jaunt back to 2023's Season 4. What was Joe\u2019s reign of terror in the UK like?",
      "Where was Joe at the start of Season 4?",
      "With his wife Love (Victoria Pedretti) dead and his daughter Henry parked with friends, Joe made it to London and somehow landed a job as a university professor, calling himself Jonathan Moore. He clicked with a few students, including Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman), who gave him a book from rising political figure Rhys Montrose (Ed Speleers).",
      "But it doesn\u2019t take long for Joe to slip, even when he\u2019s promising to be better. He loathed Malcolm (Stephen Hagan), who helped him secure the teaching position, and coveted Malcolm\u2019s art expert girlfriend Kate (Charlotte Ritchie).",
      "Both Malcolm and Kate were filthy rich, and after Joe saved Kate from being robbed (his stalking does come in handy once in a while), Joe was included in their inner circle of wealthy ne\u2019er-do-wells, influencers, and nepo babies. Why couldn\u2019t he just find a nice book club?",
      "Surrounded by jerks again, Joe reverted to form and bodies began to fall. He started getting text messages from the \u201cEat-the-Rich Killer.\u201d",
      "Joe initially thought the killer was Rhys Montrose \u2014 who he met and had a fine conversation with at a bar Kate and Malcolm\u2019s friends hung out at \u2014 but twist, Rhys wasn\u2019t real!",
      "That is, Rhys Montrose was real and an author/politician, but Joe\u2019s mind had begun playing tricks on him, creating an \u201cinner\u201d Rhys he could blame some of the murders on, like Malcolm\u2019s.",
      "So long, Marienne: Joe\u2019s flashback girlfriend",
      "Marienne (Tati Gabrielle) was the former librarian and single mom Joe tanked his relationship with Love for. At the end of Season 3, Love convinced Marienne to flee because of Joe\u2019s murderous tendencies, and after a stint in London, Marienne ended up in Paris with her daughter.",
      "Joe tracked her down, but when she threatened him with a knife \u2014 he let her go, insisting he could be a better person.",
      "Another mind-twist! In reality, Joe put her in his cage (which came with him to \u2026 London?) and left her there as his mind flapped between Good Joe and Bad Joe. But when Joe\u2019s nosy student Nadia discovered Marienne in the cage, the women contrived a way for Marienne to fake her death. Once Joe was sure Marienne had died in the cage, he decided to do something nice for her \u2026 and left her body on a bench to be discovered. But Nadia came along to wake her up and Marienne was free!",
      "Joe\u2019s next victim \u2014 er, girlfriend: Kate",
      "Kate did mourn Malcolm, but Joe slowly won her over, insisting (rightly so) that she should get away from her parasitical friend group. Over time, they revealed some of their dirty secrets to one another, and grew closer.",
      "But when Love popped up in Joe\u2019s dreams, he took a deeper look inside himself and realized he was the Eat-the-Rich killer, and that he had in fact kidnapped Marienne. The only way to end the cycle, he decided, was to end himself. He jumped into a river and was saved by police. In the hospital he came clean to Kate about his past, and no longer felt guilty about the occasional murder he had to commit. He was ready to start his life anew \u2014 with her.",
      "Kate helped Joe clean up his past, and they began a full-fledged love affair of damaged equals. But Nadia and another student, Eddie (Brad Alexander), were still investigating Joe and trying to expose him. So Joe killed Eddie and handed a shocked Nadia the murder weapon, effectively framing her. Nadia refused to speak in her own defense, and Kate and Joe walked away with clean hands, if not quite clean hearts.",
      "Season 5 of \"You\" returns to Netflix on April 24."

    "story": [
      "Author Emily Henry\u2019s career can perhaps best be described as a writer\u2019s dream.",
      "The 34-year-old has published 10 books since 2017, sold more than 9 million copies in the U.S., and secured a four-book deal in 2022 after her book \u201cBeach Read\u201d became a New York Times bestseller in the early months of the pandemic. After the release of her newest book, \u201cGreat Big Beautiful Life,\u201d on April 22, 2025, she has one more book to deliver on that deal (although she tells us it will not be her last).",
      "Five of her books are in the process of being adapted to film or TV series. The one she says is nearest completion is \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which is expected to be released on Netflix with Emily Bader and Tom Blyth playing the leads.",
      "So when TODAY.com caught up with Henry days before her newest book was released, we led with one question: How are you holding up?",
      "\u201cI've never had an interview open with that question!\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt is intense, this has been kind of a breakneck pace for me.\"",
      "Just the last few months alone have been an exciting time for Henry. As she was gearing up to release \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" early screeners for \"People We Meet On Vacation\" were viewed by select audiences, and the response so far, she tells TODAY.com, has been a \"relief.\"",
      "\"It is definitely a lot but I\u2019m riding the high in the adrenaline of all of it,\" she says. \"It\u2019s been a really, really beautiful whirlwind.\"",
      "Read on for TODAY.com's conversation with the bestselling author.",
      "This interview has been condensed and edited.",
      "It's really weird. On some days, it feels totally normal and mundane almost, and then it will hit me. I don't think it will ever feel totally normal. I think I was set up to understand how bizarre and uncommon and miraculous all of this is and I try to appreciate it at every turn. It definitely stays feeling a bit surreal at all times, but that's probably a good thing.",
      "I think \"Great Big Beautiful Life\" was sort of a sidestep where I got to have a romantic-comedy plotline but also do something a little bit different. I will write some more straightforward romantic comedies in the coming years, but I also really enjoyed getting to do something different and I'm excited to see what else is out there that would be fun to work on. At some point, I would love to revisit writing thrillers, but I am always going to love a love story.",
      "I'm a laptop and couch person. I love that Abby does that. I'm just a mess with my phone, so if I were writing fully on my phone, that would take five times as long as it would on a computer.",
      "But I will say, a lot of times, my favorite scenes are things that I first do have to write down on my phone because they happen when I'm out on the go. Sometimes you're in a waiting room and something occurs to you, or you're lying down at night and trying to go to sleep and then I have an idea for a scene or a bit of dialogue. I have to pull out my notes app and transcribe as well as I can with one eye shut. So there is something really freeing about being untethered from your computer.",
      "Oh my gosh, that makes me so happy. I didn't see a ton because I do not Google anything with \"Emily Henry\" in it. But I do get tagged and saw some really excited readers who got to see an early cut of the movie. It thrilled me and relieved me.",
      "When I saw the cut, I felt pretty sure that the readers were going to be totally in love with it. But it's definitely still a relief and really exciting to see what has been the case so far.",
      "It's the full spectrum of human emotion to go through this process. It truly is a miracle that anything gets made, and it's especially a miracle when something good gets made because there are so many obstacles. The big thing for me is wanting the adaptations to be something that the readers would be excited about but that also can stand alone as movies. That's what everybody wants, and I do believe that they've managed to pull that off.",
      "I don't think it has because from the beginning, I have understood that adaptations are going to be polarizing and people are going to have intense feelings and opinions.",
      "I think readers don't fully understand the scope of what an author can and cannot do with an adaptation. I have used every moment that I have been invited to the table, so to speak, to advocate for what I think the readers will care most about. Beyond that, I am well aware that there's not so much that I can do.  I think there's a misconception that writers are out there casting their own movies and making big calls and that's simply not the case. We are one of many, many, many voices in any room that we're in when it comes to adaptations. All we can do is advocate for the readers and hope it works out.",
      "I think there\u2019s still a sense that these books are only for women, and that\u2019s not true. I do think that\u2019s still a large percentage of who the readership is, but these books are just books, they\u2019re just stories. They\u2019re meant for anyone who needs them and anyone who should feel welcome to pick them up and give them a try.",
      "I think they\u2019re really, really important cornerstones of fiction. I think love stories are always going to matter, because to most of us, love really matters.",
      "I do think right now we are seeing a huge boom because the world does feel so unpredictable and chaotic and scary. \"Beach Read\u201d came out at the start of the pandemic and I really think that part of the reason that book took off in the way it did was because we were all housebound and lonely and isolated. And even though the pandemic is now over, I think that some of those feelings of isolation have hung around and I think we\u2019re all looking for connection and hope and I think romance offers those two things in spades.",
      "The purpose of a happily ever after, to me, is to present the idea of hope and to present the idea that even though the world can be chaotic and scary and unpredictable, there are these things in our lives that make all of it worth it or manageable on some level, and that is love."

      "The gory last act is filled with jump scares, twists and a couple of post-credits scenes. Read on for TODAY.com\u2019s breakdown of how \u201cSinners\u201d ends, where we unpack all of the plotlines and the movie\u2019s biggest questions, including who survives and who dies.",
      "What happens at the end of \u2018Sinners\u2019?",
      "After introducing characters like Smoke, Stack and Sammie in the first few minutes, \u201cSinners\u201d shows them preparing to open a juke joint in an old mill the twins purchased from a deceitful and racist landowner. As the sun sets, patrons, including Mary (Steinfeld) and Pearline (Lawson), arrive for the establishment\u2019s grand opening while others, such as Cornbread (Miller), Grace (Li), Delta Slim (Lindo) and Annie (Mosaku), are already there to help Smoke and Stack pull off a successful night.",
      "The characters spend the early hours of the evening in pure revelry, dancing and singing along to Sammie\u2019s music before an uninvited guest named Remmick (O\u2019Connell) asks to be invited in. He is denied, but ominously waits outside.",
      "Each time a character leaves the juke joint, they return changed and suddenly need approval to re-enter. Sensing an otherworldly presence, Annie quickly realizes that Remmick is a vampire who bites and creates more blood-thirsty creatures whenever a guest leaves the safety of the jukebar.",
      "Remmick later turns Mary into a vampire, who in turn does the same to her former lover Stack. Soon, more guests are turned into the undead and only a handful of humans remain.",
      "Who dies in 'Sinners'?",
      "Ultimately, everyone who is bitten and turned into a vampire dies, but some of those vampires do live on, which viewers learn in a post-credits scene.",
      "Leading up to the climatic battle, Smoke, Annie, Delta Slim, Pearline, Grace and Sammie decide to think of a plan while Remmick and the other vampires await their demise. After a desperate Grace welcomes the vampires in, the others, armed with stakes and garlic water, fight for their lives.",
      "Annie is bitten and Smoke stabs her in the heart, at her request, before she becomes a vampire. Pearline is also killed and Grace is burned alive trying to defend herself against a vampire who has taken over her husband\u2019s body. Delta Slim chooses to sacrifice himself to give Smoke and Sammie time to escape.",
      "Before the credits officially roll, viewers learn that Smoke and Sammie are the only humans left standing.",
      "Lindo spoke to TODAY.com about his character\u2019s fate and why it was honorable given Delta Slim\u2019s backstory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very heroic thing to do, but it\u2019s also a sacrifice that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to, as I see it (and) as Delta Slim sees it, preserve the future of the music and the future of the culture, it has to be done.\u201d",
      "Miller, who was also interviewed by TODAY.com, chimed in and added that Delta Slim\u2019s death represents \u201cthe redemption of whatever ills that he may have, that he may be carrying.\u201d",
      "Lindo agreed, saying his character felt compelled to save Sammie.",
      "\u201cThe fact is part of my (character\u2019s) alcoholism comes out of the guilt that I feel at not being able to have saved my friend who I talked about in the car,\" he explained. \"So it is redemptive. I couldn\u2019t save him, but I will save the young preacher boy, the young one, the young pup who\u2019s carrying the tradition forward.\u201d",
      "Who survives in 'Sinners'?",
      "As the last humans standing, Smoke and Sammie attempt to flee but vampire Stack catches them. Smoke and Stack fight and Smoke appears to get the upper hand before the scene cuts to show Sammie, who jumped out a window and injured his leg, being surrounded by Remmick and all the vampires.",
      "While Remmick tries to drown and kill Sammie, the young musician reaches for his guitar \u2014 which the twins gave to him \u2014 and smashes it into Remmick\u2019s head. The metal plate on the guitar lodges in Remmick\u2019s head and kills him as the sun rises and turns all the other vampires into ashes.",
      "Sammie returns home and the scene of him walking into the church service replays. Meanwhile, Smoke, who also survived, stays at the juke joint and waits for the man who sold him the old mill to arrive. He shoots the landowner and all the Ku Klux Klan members after previously learning from Remmick that they had planned to ambush Smoke, Stack and their friends the next morning.",
      "During the shootout, one bullet hits Smoke and he slowly dies before being greeted by an apparition of Annie and their child, who died years ago.",
      "Sammie now becomes the only human survivor. However, once the post-credits roll, viewers learn that Stack and Mary, who are both vampires, have survived as well.",
      "What do the two post-credits scenes mean?",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d waits until a post-credits scene to reveal if Sammie chose to rebuke music like his father asked.",
      "As the credits roll, viewers see an older Sammie playing music at a dive bar with his band in the \u201890s. The musician chose to continue to pursue his love of music despite that traumatic night.",
      "In a second post-credits scene, the older version of Sammie sits at a bar before two familiar faces join him: Stack and Mary. It is revealed that Mary ran off and evaded the sunlight before Remmick and the others were burned years ago.",
      "Stack sits by Sammie\u2019s side and shares that he made a deal with Smoke during their fight to leave Sammie alone. Sammie tells them that he was having the best day of his life before the bloodbath. Stack agrees, pointing out that it was the last moment he felt sunshine and saw his brother.",
      "Stack and Mary then leave, leaving the door open for a potential sequel."

      "The Kardashians are always full of surprises \u2014 and, now, snacks.",
      "On April 22, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian announced the debut of her protein-packed popcorn. Her new brand, Khloud Foods, is launching with three flavors of the quintessential movie snack: Olive Oil & Sea Salt, Sweet & Salty Kettle Corn and White Cheddar.",
      "It will be available at Target stores nationwide, on the Target website and khloudfoods.com on April 29.",
      "According to a press release, the popcorn has no seed oils (playing into the anti-seed-oil movement) or added flavorings and are non-GMO, gluten-free and kosher.",
      "Kardashian said in the release that it\u2019s made with ingredients \u201cyou can pronounce,\u201d which reinforces a common talking point in the nutrition world that hard-to-pronounce foods are inherently harmful.",
      "\u201cJust because an ingredient is unfamiliar and challenging to pronounce doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s bad for us,\u201d\u00a0Maxine Yeung, RD, CPT, NBC-HWC, told Well + Good in 2022.",
      "A serving of the popcorn has 7 grams of complete protein from the brand\u2019s proprietary \u201cKhloud Dust,\u201d a blend of seasoning and milk proteins that adds \u201cboth flavor and function.\u201d",
      "Kardashian seems to be hopping on the protein-maxxing bandwagon. Brands across the country have been catering to that consumer desire, packing the macronutrient into ice cream, candy bars, lemonade and even water. The cottage cheese industry has never been happier.",
      "Nutrition experts, however, warn excessive protein consumption could provide adverse effects if consumers aren\u2019t careful.",
      "OK, but is it any good?",
      "I am here, as a person who is highly skeptical of celebrity food brands \u2014 of which there is no shortage \u2014 to say, yes, it is.",
      "I found myself reaching for a bag when I wasn\u2019t ready for a meal but needed a little boost. Whether or not that\u2019s due to the placebo effect, I\u2019ve already eaten the entire bag of Kettle Corn, and I\u2019ll probably buy more in the future.",
      "I may be \u201cable to pronounce\u201d milk protein isolate \u2014 the ingredient that gives this product its protein boost \u2014 but didn\u2019t know what it was until now: a supplement made from skim milk that has little effect on the popcorn\u2019s taste, at least to my tongue.",
      "Those of us who down protein shakes are familiar with the grit of protein powder. That texture is not unwelcome here.",
      "Anyone who has had a bag of white cheddar Smartfood popcorn is familiar with its pleasant powderiness, which is present in all of Khloud\u2019s popped offerings. Unsurprisingly, it works best in the White Cheddar.",
      "I will say that that texture was a little less pleasant with the Kettle Corn, since I expected it be more sticky than gritty. But I actually liked that my hands weren\u2019t covered with syrupy residue after downing a handful.",
      "The one flavor I didn\u2019t enjoy was the Olive Oil & Sea Salt. I could taste neither the olive oil nor the sea salt. But, as the blandest of the three flavors, it could make a good protein-packed base for some popcorn balls if you have leftover Easter candy."

    "summary": "High-level talks aimed at bringing a pause to fighting in Ukraine disintegrated Wednesday after Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff pulled out of the meeting, dealing a blow to Kyiv\u2019s hopes for a short-term peace agreement.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, accusing him of derailing negotiations to end the war in Ukraine while a peace deal was \u201cvery close.\u201d",
      "In a long post on Truth Social, Trump described Zelenskyy\u2019s rejection of Russia's takeover of Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, as \u201cvery harmful\u201d to achieving peace.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about here,\u201d he said at a media conference Tuesday. \u201cThis is against our constitution.\u201d",
      "During an Oval Office media event Wednesday evening, Trump suggested negotiations with Zelenskyy have been \u201charder\u201d than dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it\u2019s been harder.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump's comments come after months of discord between the two leaders, including a heated exchange in the Oval Office in February. The two men had a near-shouting match when Zelenskyy noted that Russia has broken previous agreements with Ukraine during a disagreement that included Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The situation escalated when Trump raised his voice and pointed his finger at Zelenskyy, accusing him of \"gambling with World War III\" and being \"disrespectful\" to the U.S.",
      "Trump ordered a pause on military aid, including providing Ukraine with intelligence, following the Oval Office clash.",
      "Zelenskyy urged Trump to visit Ukraine earlier this month after Russia launched two ballistic missiles at Sumy, killing 34 people and injuring 119. He suggested that a visit to the destruction would help U.S. leadership \"understand what Putin did.\"",
      "High-level talks aimed at bringing a pause to fighting in Ukraine disintegrated earlier after Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff pulled out, dealing a blow to Kyiv\u2019s hopes for a short-term peace agreement.",
      "While ministerial talks that had been planned in London fell apart, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, still planned to meet with Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who arrived in London early Wednesday with the Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers.",
      "The parties in London agreed to \"continue the dialogue,\" Yermak said on Telegram following the meeting.",
      "\"We conveyed our position and emphasized that an immediate, complete, and unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward launching negotiations aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace,\" he said. \"We expressed hope that this aligns with the vision of President Donald Trump.\"",
      "In a post on X, Zelenskyy commended the meeting, though \"emotions have run high.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s important that each side was not just a participant but contributed meaningfully. The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace.\"",
      "The latest setback comes during a week in which the Trump administration has doubled down on efforts to push Kyiv and Moscow toward a truce. Next week marks 100 days of Trump's second presidential term, and he promised to end the war on his first day back in office. Rubio suggested last week that the United States may walk away from ceasefire efforts, failing any further progress.",
      "Vance said earlier in the day that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the talks but also doubled down on the threat to walk away from negotiations.",
      "\u201cI think that we put together a very fair proposal,\u201d he told reporters on his trip in India. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see if the Europeans, the Russians and the Ukrainians are ultimately able to get this thing over the finish line.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the U.S. has not set a deadline for a ceasefire and that \"Russia does not consider it appropriate to set deadlines either,\" Russian news agency Tass reported.",
      "\"The downgrading is significant,\" said Bence N\u00e9meth, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at King\u2019s College London, citing Zelenskyy's rejection of Russia's maintaining control of Crimea as part of any deal.",
      "Rubio and Witkoff's absence \"suggests that Washington is increasingly disinterested in drawn-out, multilateral negotiations,\" N\u00e9meth added. \"This is not just about diplomacy fatigue. It also signals a hard pivot: The U.S. is not positioning itself as a neutral mediator.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed Tuesday that Rubio would skip the meeting hours after saying the opposite. \u201cThat is not a statement regarding the meetings. It\u2019s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite initial plans to attend the scheduled talks, neither Rubio nor Witkoff were in London on Wednesday, a European diplomat told NBC News.",
      "But representatives from the U.K., Germany and France still met with Yermak and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in what the British Foreign Ministry described as \"productive and successful\" discussions.",
      "\"All parties reiterated their strong support for President Trump\u2019s commitment to stopping the killing and achieving a just and lasting peace,\" the ministry said. \"The talks today were productive and successful, and significant progress was made on reaching a common position on next step.\"",
      "Expectations that Kyiv and Moscow would make a deal to end their three-year war this week remained low after the U.S. presented Ukraine and its European allies with peace proposals last week in Paris that both sides saw as unacceptable, according to NBC News\u2019 international partner, Sky News.",
      "Under a \u201cterms sheet\u201d offered by Rubio and Witkoff, a land-for-peace deal would recognize Russia\u2019s currently illegal annexation of Crimea and work toward lifting European Union sanctions on Russia. Both parties have since rejected the terms.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister, wrote on X that Ukraine was ready to negotiate \u201cbut not to surrender.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur people will not accept a frozen conflict disguised as peace,\u201d she wrote.",
      "After months of upbeat statements on indirect U.S.-led talks, but limited practical engagement, Putin on Tuesday suggested for the first time that he would be open to bilateral ceasefire talks with Zelenskyy.",
      "The issue of Crimea may well be one of the most difficult points of difference to overcome, said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\"I think it will be extraordinarily difficult, bordering on political suicide, for him [Zelenskyy] to commit to paper on things like giving up Crimea,\" Savill said. That said, \"Ukraine is not going to recapture Crimea anytime soon. Ukraine is unlikely to be a NATO member anytime soon.\"",
      "\"There might be some formulation [of a deal] that effectively kicks those into the long grass,\" he added, with the caveat that \"the terms of any deal at the moment are not going to be particularly favorable to Ukraine.\""

      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d Brig. Gen.\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed.",
      "The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

      "In a video, Mahmoud Ajjour is beaming as he skips into the breeze. He breaks into laughter as he watches his kite flutter in the sky, pulling it along with a string tied around his waist, in a moment that captured the irrepressible joy of childhood.",
      "At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children.",
      "Mahmoud now lives in Doha, Qatar, with his family, after becoming one of a very small number of Palestinians to be evacuated from Gaza for urgent medical treatment.",
      "When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. \u201cThere are bad moments for him,\u201d his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play or go outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep him busy and have fun with him,\u201d Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay.",
      "For now, Ajjour said, there\u2019s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he\u2019s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family.",
      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Marcus Wu\u2019s home racing simulator setup needs one more thing: a manual gearshift. A decade ago, one from a Western brand would have been a no-brainer for gamers like the 12-year-old Hongkonger.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201d",
      "The duo were browsing Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po computer market \u2014 a sprawling hub of small tech stores selling everything from computer parts to gaming equipment for casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.",
      "To residents and tourists from mainland China \u2014 a country with a gaming market of half a billion users \u2014 the market is a one-stop shop, featuring top American brands including Dell, Corsair and the Nasdaq-listed Swiss manufacturer Logitech.",
      "Those are just some of the companies competing for market share in a gaming industry that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates will be worth $300 billion by 2027. According to China\u2019s Game Industry Report, China\u2019s gamers contributed $44 billion in sales revenues to the industry last year.",
      "To be sure, Western brands are still popular when it comes to big-ticket items like monitors, processors and storage devices, but sellers at the market told NBC News that Chinese brands have been knocking it out of the park when it comes to accessories, like mice, keyboards and simulator setups.",
      "\u201cSo many Chinese manufacturers popped up after the pandemic,\u201d said Dennis Leung, a sales assistant at a store that specializes in gaming peripherals. \u201cThey often provide an extremely cheap and bargain price compared to the whole market,\u201d he said.",
      "Standing in front of a table of 30 mice, Leung held up two with identical feel and weight. The Chinese option, which was cheaper and more powerful, had been outselling its Western counterpart, he said.",
      "The Trump administration last week issued a memorandum saying that electronics including computers, smartphones and some components will be temporarily exempt from levies imposed on Chinese imports.",
      "But Trump\u2019s indication that duties on semiconductors and other technology could be on their way means it\u2019s still unclear whether electronics could get more expensive in the U.S. and whether prices of American-made products could go up for the rest of the world, too.",
      "That uncertainty may already be causing nervousness at companies such as Dell \u2014 the $56 billion tech giant has a 20% share of the global gaming market \u2014 as well as the $12 billion market cap for Logitech and specialists such as Corsair, which is worth $630 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s market-roiling tariffs come at a time when the quality of Chinese products has already vastly improved. That\u2019s giving Hong Kong\u2019s vendors a chance to capitalize.",
      "When it comes to buying gaming accessories, shoppers don\u2019t really care where the end product is coming from, Kira Fong, manager of another store in the market, told NBC News. \u201cMost people just look for quality. They still want the best equipment,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysts expect Chinese-made tech products only to get better.",
      "\u201cPeople are choosing more Chinese-made products in each industry, not just personal computers, gaming, smartphones or electric vehicles,\u201d said Xiao Feng Zeng, who analyzes China\u2019s gaming and esports industry at Niko Partners, an Asian and European gaming intelligence firm.",
      "\u201cTheir quality is better and the price is cheaper,\u201d the Shanghai-based vice president said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt America\u2019s ability to compete for young gamers.",
      "The policies of the president, who refers to himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d are already feeding through into higher prices.",
      "Hyte, a gaming PC sister brand of the California-based iBuyPower, said this month on X that while it was standing by increased prices, those prices will not be sustainable long term.",
      "That was not a problem for Marcus Wu, and more importantly his dad, at checkout at the Sham Shui Po market.",
      "With his son excited to go home and play with his new gearshift, Mingfai Wu breathed a sigh of relief.",

      "Ajjour's mother, Nour Ajjour recalled that painful moment in a phone interview with NBC News on Friday.",
      "\"The first few days were very difficult. He was in a lot of pain as there was no anaesthetic,\" she said. \"He would look at his hands and not see them. He would scream and say, 'where are my hands?' And the first thing he said was, 'how will I hug you?' and 'how will I pray?'\"",
      "Ajjour was evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Qatar's capital, Doha, where Abu Elouf took his portrait for The New York Times. The photographer also fled to the city.",

      "UNICEF warned in December 2023 that around 1,000 children in Gaza had seen one or both legs amputated alone since Oct. 7, 2023, when Israel began its military campaign in the enclave following the Hamas-led terror attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThese are unbelievable numbers,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Al-Fara,\u00a0head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview earlier this month, noting that thousands of children have also been killed and more still have been left without one or both parents.",
      "Al-Fara said he could not understand \u201cthe silence of the world\u201d in the midst of the widespread devastation in Gaza, where much of the enclave has been destroyed.",
      "Many of the operations children in Gaza have had to undergo have been done without anesthetic, according to UNICEF, with the enclave's health care system also hit hard by Israel's offensive, which it restarted last month after a pause in the fighting.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of the ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 ended March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces\u00a0shattered the fragile truce and have since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Israel has also barred the entry of medical supplies, along with food, water and other vital aid, during a more than monthlong blockade of the enclave.",
      "Efforts to secure a more permanent ceasefire and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza have so far failed to yield results.",
      "In the meantime, Ajjour is learning how to live without his arms.",
      "\"We all help Mahmoud in everything, in food, drink, clothing and the smallest things.\" But she said her son is also learning to use his feet to do things like writing and playing games on his mobile phone.",

      "The word \u201cconclave\u201d comes from the Latin for \u201cwith key.\u201d It is a church tradition that began in 1268 with a papal election that lasted almost three years, ending only when the townspeople of Viterbo locked up the cardinals, tore the roof off their palace, fed them nothing but bread and water and threatened them until a new pope was chosen.",
      "While it is very unlikely the decision on Pope Francis\u2019 successor will take quite as long or be quite as contentious, Vatican watchers agree that the winner is not a foregone conclusion.",
      "\u201cThe great joy of the conclave is that nobody really knows and it\u2019s such a unique electorate,\u201d James Somerville-Meikle, the former deputy director of the Catholic Union of Great Britain, told NBC News before Francis\u2019 death. \u201cSo many conclaves in the past have thrown up surprises.\u201d",
      "The College of Cardinals, he said, has always been faced with two questions: \u201cDo we try something new? Do we go for continuity?\u201d",
      "NBC News takes a look at the figures believed to be the top contenders.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi",
      "The fifth of six siblings, the Rome-born Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, 69, has built a reputation as a peacemaker and has worked with the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic lay association devoted to ecumenism and conflict resolution.",
      "\u201cThat community had a very active role in peace-building activities and finding agreements in Africa, where they have been involved in South Sudan,\u201d said NBC Vatican analyst Deborah Lubov. The east African nation has been ravaged by civil war, violence and famine since it gained independence from neighboring Sudan in March 2011.",
      "Lubov added that Zuppi, the archbishop of Bologna, was one of four mediators who helped bring an end to the civil war in the east African country of Mozambique in 1982 and more recently had been Francis\u2019 envoy for peace in Ukraine and Russia.",

      "Tim Gabrielli, the Gudorf chair in Catholic intellectual traditions at the University of Dayton in Ohio, agreed that Zuppi was \u201cvery close to Francis,\u201d and that he is \u201cvery much a pastor figure, close to the people.\u201d",
      "But Gabrielli said Zuppi was \u201crelative newcomer\u201d when it comes to Italian episcopal politics and didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily have the breadth of Vatican experience that is often looked at.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s a diplomat, and this is something that the cardinals might like,\u201d said Faggioli, although he added that as secretary of state \u201cyou have to make many decisions on behalf of the pope, and you have to make a number of enemies among other cardinals.\u201d",
      "Parolin, Faggioli said, is \u201ca centrist, and he\u2019s a man of the institution, a stabilizer.\u201d",
      "However, Faggioli and other Vatican insiders agreed that Parolin\u2019s chances could take a hit because he was the chief architect of an agreement with China on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in the communist country that gave the pope the final say.",
      "Critics complained that it betrayed Catholics who remained loyal to the pope despite persecution, and some have said it prevented the Vatican from denouncing rights abuses in China. They also point to increasing restrictions on religious freedoms in China for Christians and other minorities.",
      "Parolin would have a lot of explaining to do about China to remedy his reputation as a credible candidate when it comes to the future of the Catholic Church, some Vatican obeservers said.",
      "Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151",
      "The first of six children, Hungarian Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151 \u201ccirculates regularly in conservative blogs as one who would shift away from Francis,\u201d according to Monsignor Kevin Irwin, a research professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "\u201cA decided player for the conservative cardinals,\u201d Irwin said via email, adding that Erd\u0151, 72, now the archbishop of Budapest, is \u201ca highly trained canon lawyer\u201d who has written several erudite articles and books on the sources of canon law.",

      "Faggioli added that Erd\u0151 differed with Francis on the way the church should address immigration.",
      "While Francis often called for compassion toward migrants, he said Erd\u0151 was \u201cmore Eastern European and questions the ability to assimilate.\u201d",
      "Gabrielli said Erd\u0151 reminds \u201csome of us of John Paul II ... [which] comes from the fact that they were both raised under communist rule.\u201d",
      "He is also similar to Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who \u201cthought of Europe as key and the idea that Christianity of Europe was very important.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Tagle, who has been dubbed the \u201cAsian Pope Francis\u201d by some, would be presenting himself as a close follower of the recently deceased pontiff, according to Somerville-Meikle of the Catholic Union of Great Britain.",
      "Tagle, 67, a Filipino national who features his nickname, \u201cChito,\u201d on his X profile, is known as a champion of the poor in the Philippines and has campaigned on many social issues in his homeland, Somerville-Meikle said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly articulate and would be very able to extend Pope Francis\u2019 reflections theologically,\u201d said Gabrielli, adding that Tagle has been adept at taking Francis\u2019 ideas and running with them.",
      "However, Gabrielli said that Tagle\u2019s reputation took a bit of a hit when Francis ousted the management of the Vatican\u2019s international charitable organization, Caritas Internationalis, after an external review found management and morale problems at its head office.",
      "Tagle, who had served as the organization\u2019s president since May 2015, was among those relieved of their duties, despite having called for the review in the first place, Gabrielli said.",
      "\u201cThere might be questions resulting from that about his ability to manage,\u201d he added.",
      "However, since June, Tagle has been in charge of the Dicastery for Evangelization, one of the church's most important departments, and Gabrielli said he seemed to be doing \u201ca good job there.\u201d",
      "Other contenders",
      "Among the other candidates who might come up for consideration are the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, and Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, 77, the archbishop of Colombo in Sri Lanka.",
      "The general secretary of the Synod of Bishops, the Maltese Cardinal Mario Grech, and Cardinal Charles Muang Bo of Burma, the archbishop of Yangon, may also be considered.",
      "Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, the archbishop of Vienna, is also a \u201cwell respected\u201d figure who understands the importance of governing an international archdiocese while maintaining a \u201cmoderate line between being open-minded to dialogue about the future of the church but also keeping close to the tradition of the Catholic faith,\u201d NBC News\u2019 Lubov said.",
      "But at 80, \u201chis days as a candidate are probably behind him,\u201d Gabrielli said, although he added that Sch\u00f6nborn \u201cbefuddles people who try and label him as either conservative or liberal,\u201d which might lead some to see him as a compromise candidate.",
      "Age and experience may rule out Canadian Cardinal G\u00e9rald Lacroix, the archbishop of Quebec, because at 67, some may consider him too young, Faggioli said. \u201cI expect they will look for a candidate in their 70s,\u201d he added.",
      "Gabrielli added that Lacroix was \u201ca real pastor, people person. He\u2019s not a corporate in-his-office type, which I think reminds people of Francis. He really prioritizes evangelization, but I wonder if he has the global scope that some cardinals will look for.\u201d"

      "In life, Pope Francis strayed from the more conservative path forged by his predecessors Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict.",
      "But in death, Francis will be following in many of John Paul\u2019s footsteps.",
      "The demise of the first Argentine to lead the Roman Catholic Church set into motion a series of rituals, some of which go back more than 2,000 years and have been used to bury more than 250 popes.",
      "They are compiled in a more than 400-page tome called the \u201cOrdo exsequiarum Romani pontificis,\u201d which includes the liturgy, music and prayers used for papal funerals over the centuries.",
      "\u201cThe Ordo covers the rituals that are followed from the moment a pope dies to the moment a pope is buried,\u201d said the Rev. David Collins, an associate professor and the director of Catholic studies at Georgetown University.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "But in accordance with his wishes, Francis is expected to be buried at the ancient Basilica of St. Mary Major, which lies outside the Vatican\u2019s walls.",
      "The Vatican laid out plans for the body of Pope Francis on Monday, saying that he will be placed in his coffin later the same night.",
      "\u201cHis Most Reverend Eminence Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, will preside over the rite of confirmation of death and the placing of the body in the coffin,\u201d the Vatican said in a statement.",
      "The rite will take place in the Chapel of the Domus Sanct\u00e6 Marth\u00e6.",
      "His body could be moved to St Peter\u2019s Basilica as early as Wednesday to allow his worshippers to pay their respects, the Vatican said, adding that a formal decision on the issue would be made by a group of cardinals during a meeting on Tuesday.",
      "The playbook for Francis\u2019 funeral will also draw from a 20-page document called the \u201cUniversi Dominici Gregis,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cThe Shepherd of the Lord\u2019s Whole Flock\u201d and was issued by John Paul in 1996, Collins said.",
      "\u201cThis, essentially, lays out the procedures for what happens after a reigning pope dies between the death of one pope and the election of his successor, a period called the papal interregnum,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Those were the rules that were in place during the send-off of John Paul, who died April 2, 2005, and was buried six days later. During those six days, millions of people filed past his coffin in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and there was a funeral attended by presidents and monarchs. Because Benedict resigned and was not the pope when he died, Francis\u2019 ceremonies will more closely resemble John Paul\u2019s.",
      "This is what happens during the interregnum, which started with Francis\u2019 death and will last until the College of Cardinals chooses a new pope:"

      "The longest took place in the 13th century, before conclaves were formalized, when the process that eventually elected Pope Gregory X started in 1268 and ended in 1271. In all, it took two years and nine months, a process that led to the rules and procedures of conclaves.",
      "Most popes choose their papal name upon election, a practice that\u2019s been common for the past thousand years. For instance, Argentine Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio chose the name Francis upon being elected in 2013 \u2014 the first pope to use the name Francis. \u00a0By comparison, there have been more than 20 popes\u00a0with the most common name: John.",
      "At the time of his death, Francis was the second-oldest pope in the last 400-some years.",

When journalist Marlina Whop introduced the segment, she said the network interviewed two sisters who explained how their mother and another man interacted with the thief. But the Powers sisters\u2019 retelling was far from what viewers were anticipating.",
      "In the interview, Bridgette and Paula Powers spoke in unison while dressed in the same bunny-covered shirts. \u201cOne guy, he was up there with our mom. He went up there and he was coming back down toward us. And he goes, \u2018Run, he\u2019s got a gun!\u2019\u201d the sisters reenacted at the same time. \u201cOh, our hearts started to pound.

      "Initial reports said gunmen sprayed bullets at mostly Indian tourists visiting Baisaran meadow, some 3 miles from Pahalgam. Police said multiple tourists suffered gunshot wounds and officials were evacuating the wounded to hospitals.",
      "Reinforcements of police and soldiers cordoned off the area and launched a hunt for the attackers.",
      "No other details were immediately available.",
      "The meadow in Pahalgam is a top sightseeing destination, surrounded by snowcapped mountains and dotted with dense pine forests. It is visited by hundreds of tourists every day.",
      "Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety.",
      "Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict."

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Wednesday to what is known as the \u201cexpert level\u201d \u2014 a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly.",
      "However, experts not involved in the talks who spoke with The Associated Press warn that this doesn\u2019t necessarily signal a deal is imminent. Instead, it means that the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff haven\u2019t broken down at what is likely the top-level trade \u2014 Tehran limiting its atomic program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "\u201cAgreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who has long studied Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "\u201cIf Witkoff was making maximalist demands during his talks with Araghchi, such as dismantlement of the enrichment program, Iran would have no incentive to meet at the technical level.\u201d",
      "That technical level, however, remains filled with possible landmines. Just how much enrichment by Iran would be comfortable for the United States? What about Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program, which President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would remain in place on the Islamic Republic?",
      "\u201cThe most important determinant of expert talks\u2019 value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,\u201d said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "\u201cIf the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.\u201d",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men\u2019s technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal.",
      "Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to enrich uranium only to 3.67% purity and keep a stockpile of only 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran\u2019s overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds)."
