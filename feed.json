    "story": [
      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\" which opens in theaters Friday",
      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\u201d a riff on a claustrophobic courtroom thriller set in a primary school classroom.",
      "The film, which won the best first feature prize at Cannes last year, dolls out bits and pieces of information slowly and purposefully, building not a solid set of answers but a web of complications and ambiguities. It is a strange and fascinating experience that may be a bit frustratingly inconclusive but is never not compelling.",
      "Even the inciting incident is withheld from the audience for a time. We\u2019re thrown into a conversation between a junior teacher, Sunna (Thea Lambrechts Vaulen), an administrator type Asja (Vera Veljovic) and the school\u2019s principal, Jarle (\u00d8ysten R\u00f8ger). Asja and Jarle are entrusting Sunna to lead this conversation (though they'll have to join eventually). None of them are even quite sure what exactly happened, whether it was innocent or malicious, or what to do if they can get to the bottom of it. Jarle advises Sunna to treat it soberly, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.",
      "Not even Armand\u2019s mother Elisabeth ( \"The Worst Person in the World's\"Renate Reinsve ) gets a hint as to what the meeting is about. She\u2019s a famous actress whose career has come to a halt and who has been tabloid fodder recently. Elisabeth arrives at the classroom first and wants answers, understandably. Sunna must awkwardly delay providing any information until the other parents arrive to Elisabeth\u2019s increasing frustration. Sunna even stammers something reassuring that it\u2019s not too bad. She is, of course, lying because the accusation is serious and beyond any of their depths. Armand\u2019s classmate Jon has apparently told his parents, Sarah (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Anders (Endre Hellestve) that Armand has sexually abused and threatened him. They\u2019re both 6-year-olds.",
      "These aren\u2019t just schoolmates either but cousins and that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg of trauma and shared history in this room, haunted by characters who aren\u2019t even present: Armand and his dead father, Thomas. Neither of the kids is shown through the duration, and there\u2019s much debate over whether 6-year-olds would use the language that the adults allege.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d is the directorial debut of writer-director Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who has the daunting pressure of being a descendant of cinema royalty. As if making a movie isn\u2019t hard enough on its own, T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandparents are Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman. And perhaps because of that \u201cArmand\u201d pushes away from the conventions of a straightforward, talky character study and plays with our perception of reality. Twice Elisabeth breaks into choreographed dance \u2014 both expressions of her emotional state and one of which takes a particularly sinister turn.",
      "One might expect that two unexpected dance sequences would be the standouts in a film, but \u201cArmand\u201d has another. It\u2019s also a release, in a way. After a while of back and forth, debates, reveals and non-starters, Elisabeth breaks out into uncontrollable laughter. This stretches on for several agonizing, astonishingly impressive minutes of mad exertion. It\u2019s really quite an acting marvel from Reinsve \u2014 and everyone else in the scene watching it all play out. A broken fire alarm that goes off sporadically helps keep the atmosphere nice and tense, as does Asja\u2019s random nose bleeds that always seem to derail pivotal decision-making moments.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d engages in some stylish wheel spinning, broken up by some revelations and cathartic moments. And yet every time you feel like you have a grasp on the situation, something else arises that seems to undermine it. Ambiguity and inconclusiveness can be satisfying in cinematic storytelling, but this feels a little too underbaked either way. Ideas are introduced and abandoned, or not fleshed out well. Why, exactly, has she stopped working, for instance. And what\u2019s the story behind Anders\u2019 and Elisabeth\u2019s relationship? It\u2019s a promising debut from T\u00f8ndel, nonetheless \u2014 a film that will keep you engaged if not entirely satisfied.",
      "\u201cArmand,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csexual material and some language.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "But the price tag is worth it, advertisers say. Rachel Jaiven, head of H\u00e4agen-Dazs marketing, said the brand decided to make its first-ever appearance in the game due to the size of the viewership and its association with snacking.",

      "The band, one of the most influential of all heavy metal bands, will headline \u201cThe Back to the Beginning\u201d show on July 5 at Villa Park, home of the Aston Villa Football Club in Birmingham, England.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my time to go back to the beginning \u2026 time for me to give back to the place where I was born,\u201d Osbourne said in a statement. \u201cHow blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham forever.\u201d",
      "Osbourne, who was the band's front man during its peak period in the 1970s and who was widely known as the \"Prince of Darkness,\" will deliver his own short set before Sabbath bandmates, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, join him for the first time in two decades.",

      "An Arkansas organist is marking the 275th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death by playing all of the German composer's organ works, but he's doing it one lunch break at a time",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- It was hushed inside a 140-year-old cathedral on the outskirts of Little Rock's downtown as about five dozen people sat in the pews during a recent lunch break in January.",
      "The nave filled with the sounds of the Gothic church's pipe organ, and a screen showed a man performing the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Those gathered weren't there for church, but for the third concert in a series Colin MacKnight is performing over the next year to commemorate the 275th anniversary of Bach's death.",
      "MacKnight, Trinity Episcopal Cathedral's music director, is performing all of Bach's organ works throughout 2025 \u2014 one lunch break at a time. The ambitious plan entails performing 18 hours of music in half-hour increments nearly every Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI've wanted to for a really long time because it's, I think, the most thorough way of immersing myself in the brilliance of Johann Sebastian Bach,\u201d MacKnight said one morning as he rehearsed in the empty cathedral the day before a concert.",
      "The concerts in Little Rock are among several events around the world this year commemorating the German composer\u2019s legacy and the anniversary of his death.",
      "MacKnight, who is from Bethesda, Maryland, has been music director at Trinity for three years. He said the first time he remembers hearing Bach was at a relative's funeral when he was about 12 years old.",
      "\u201cSomething about hearing it that time just really mesmerized me and that was the beginning of my love of Bach,\u201d he said.",
      "The 31-year-old's hands move easily between the four keyboards of the organ console, flanked by knobs controlling different sounds that are assembled into various combinations.",
      "Underneath, his feet press on the pedalboards \u2014 combining to create the notes of Bach's works. MacKnight, who has played the organ since he was 16, acknowledges how dizzying the sight of the instrument can be for newcomers.",
      "\u201cIf you don't know what you're looking at, it's a little overwhelming, like an airplane console,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight's concerts \u2014 which are free and open to the public \u2014 are also mini-lessons for those who come, with a glossary of terms like concerto and fugue included in the program. In between pieces, MacKnight gives audience members some background on Bach and his organ works.",
      "\u201cThese pieces are in the unfortunate category of being much, much harder than they sound,\u201d he says.",
      "Generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Bach is known in particular for his organ works and their heavy use of pedals and complex structures. Few organists perform the composer's complete organ works, given the difficulty and quantity of the music.",
      "They include Grammy-winning organist Paul Jacobs, who taught MacKnight at the Juilliard School. Jacobs performed an 18-hour nonstop concert of Bach's organ works to mark the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.",
      "The free concerts so far have drawn a mix of church members, classical music aficionados and newcomers who say they want a quiet break from the daily bustle.",
      "\u201cI like the complexity of the music and the power of the organ, which stirs me internally,\u201d said Barry Coplin, a member of the church who has attended two of MacKnight\u2019s concerts.",
      "Ben Wiley, who lives about 30 minutes away, is a classical music fan who was attending his third of MacKnight\u2019s shows and said he appreciates being able to hear Bach\u2019s works in half-hour increments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to be able to get it done in short bursts, to be able to absorb it better and come back to get the next batch,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight is also performing a 100-minute concert of Bach's most extensive organ work \u2014 the Clavier-Ubung III, sometimes referred to as the German Organ Mass \u2014 on July 28, the day the German composer died in 1750 at 65.",
      "The Rev. Thomas Alexander, a priest at Trinity, said the concerts allow the public to enjoy MacKnight's talents, come together and learn more about Bach in a way they normally wouldn't be able to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like reading someone's complete collection of novels. You get to really get to know someone in a comprehensive way,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut it also builds a sense of community.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- If you tune into the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d on Sunday, you'll likely see a key person's influence \u2014 even if you don't actually see her.",
      "Victoria Schade is a dog trainer and novelist who's the show\u2019s lead puppy trainer and wrangler. She's the one making sure the shelter pups have a conflict-free contest and that they're captured at their most adorable \u2014 all from off-camera.",
      "It is Schade who gets the puppies to look up during the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d or run through a tunnel to get to the field for the starting lineups. She\u2019s on the lookout for possible conflicts or nervous dogs.",
      "\u201cMy responsibilities include ensuring puppy happiness and safety during gameplay,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if there\u2019s any moment where a puppy looks like they\u2019re overwhelmed or they just need a break, I\u2019ll step out and give them a little break on the sideline.\u201d",
      "Schade has been working with the doggies on the Animal Planet show for 19 years and is believed to be the longest serving member of the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d crew. She also works the kitten halftime show and calls filming both her favorite week of the year.",
      "\u201cI think she is one of the most dedicated, hardest working people out there in the business,\u201d says \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d referee Dan Schachner, now in his 14th year. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ever seem to run out of energy. She never says no to a request and there\u2019s always brightness and sunshine from her with every step.\u201d",
      "Schade has coached hundreds of dogs over the years but never adopted one from the show \u2014 until now. She took home Boris \u2014 known on the show as Mr. Pickles \u2014 from Dallas Dog rescue. \u201cI saw star quality. So this was the year,\u201d she says.",
      "Early on, Schade was responsible for recruiting and selecting the puppies, a task now that leans on animal rescue groups and shelters throughout the country. These days, she's the lead trainer.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing the puppy looking up at the camera, I\u2019m typically right there with the treat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of treats and funny noises. And that does the trick.\u201d",
      "This year, Schade is stepping out from the sidelines and joining Schachner on camera for an hour-long pre-game kickoff show, which features a doggie combine and a draft. Other show highlights include segments with Dan Smyers, from superstar country duo Dan + Shay, and Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi.",
      "Schade has developed some very special animal-related skills over the years, including anticipating when one of the players needs to relieve itself.",
      "\u201cOne of my \u2018Puppy Bowl\u2019 skills is reading butts. So I know when a puppy is going to go to the bathroom and I\u2019ll typically say like, \u2018Watch out in the 20-yard-line, we\u2019re going to have a deposit\u2019 and everyone\u2019s ready to go with that cleanup.\u201d",
      "The \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d made its debut as counter-programming to the Super Bowl in 2005. Dogs score touchdowns on a gridiron carpet when they cross the goal line \u2014 any goal line \u2014 with a toy in their mouth.",
      "The show is really just an excuse to spend time watching adorable, clumsy pups play with chew toys, wag their tails furiously and lick the camera. A deeper reason is to encourage animal adoption.",
      "According to the ASPCA, approximately 390,000 shelter dogs are euthanized each year and 2 million shelter dogs are adopted.",
      "Most of the puppies are usually adopted by airtime, since the show was filmed in the fall. But the point is to show that animals just like the ones on the show can be found at any shelter at any time.",
      "This year's three-hour television event this year will feature 142 rescue puppies from 80 shelters across 40 states \u2014 and one from Nicaragua, a Chihuahua-German shepherd. There will be 11 special needs dogs.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most amount we\u2019ve ever had,\" says Schachner. \"Look out for Jolene, who is a pitbull mix that\u2019s in a wheelchair. Look out for a three-legged Boston terrier from New York City. And my personal favorite, is Sprinkle, who is a blind and deaf Aussie. So it\u2019s just incredible to watch them play.\u201d",
      "The inaugural \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d was watched by nearly 6 million viewers. Last year, 12.6 million viewers tuned in. In comparison, this year\u2019s Golden Globes attracted 9.3 million.",

      "She advises dog owners to learn to read the body language of their pet, to try to understand what they're trying to say. Like tail-wagging \u2014 how tight? And where is the tail positioned?",
      "Schade is a big advocate for positive reinforcement and science-based training, not the so-called alpha dog approach, which uses intimidation or force.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be the alpha, which has been debunked anyway. You are your dog's ally. You\u2019re their friend. You\u2019re their No. 1. And it\u2019s a relationship based in compassion and understanding.\u201d",
      "That means load up on treats. She advocates keeping them in your pocket and consistently using them as rewards for good behavior, especially when potty training.",
      "\u201cI cannot stress it enough: When you think you\u2019re treating enough, treat more because, especially during puppyhood, it is such a critical learning period and every interaction is a chance to teach something.\u201d",

      "After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th Academy Awards are going forward",
      "After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th Academy Awards are going forward.",
      "Like the Grammys and other awards shows this year, the ceremony will be transformed by the fires and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has pledged to help its members and the broader film community recover.",
      "Here\u2019s everything you need to know about this year\u2019s show:",
      "The Academy Awards will be held on Sunday, March 2 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The show, to be broadcast live by ABC, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.",
      "For the first time, the Oscars will be streamed live on Hulu. You can also watch via Hulu Live TV, YouTubeTV, AT&T TV and FuboTV. With authentication from your provider, you can watch on ABC.com and the ABC app.",
      "For the first time, Conan O'Brien is hosting the Academy Awards. O'Brien, the late night host turned podcaster and occasional movie star, said upon the announcement: \u201cAmerica demanded it and now it\u2019s happening: Taco Bell\u2019s new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I\u2019m hosting the Oscars.\"",
      "The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards. The academy twice postponed the announcement of nominations but never pushed the March 2 date of the ceremony. Academy leaders have argued the show must go ahead, for their economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of resilience.",
      "Organizers have vowed this year\u2019s awards will \u201ccelebrate the work that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires.\u201d",
      "Still, the fires have curtailed much of the usual frothiness of Hollywood's awards season. The film academy canceled its annual nominees luncheon.",
      "For many involved in the Oscars, the fires have been felt acutely. O'Brien's Pacific Palisades home survived but his family has been unable to go back to it. O'Brien's assistant and podcast co-host Sona Movsesian lost her home.",
      "\u201cI know so many people who lost their homes and I\u2019m just, was ridiculously lucky,\u201d O'Brien told The Associated Press. \"So we want to make sure that that show reflects what\u2019s happening and that we put a light on the right people in the right way.\u201d",
      "The academy announced Wednesday that last year's acting winners \u2014 Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph Joy \u2014 will all return to the Oscar stage. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the \u201cfab five\" style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers has reportedly abandoned those plans for this year's ceremony.",
      "The academy has announced that unlike previous years, the original song nominees will not be performed this time. That doesn't mean there won't be music, though. \u201cWicked,\u201d one of the biggest box-office hits of 2024, could feasibly figure into the Oscar plans. (Its songs weren't eligible for best song since, hailing from the Broadway musical, they aren't original to the movie.)",
      "The 10 nominees for best picture are: \u201cAnora\u201d; \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d; \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d; \u201cConclave\u201d; \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d; \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d; \u201cNickel Boys\u201d; \u201cThe Substance\u201d; \u201cWicked\u201d",
      "Some of the nominees are still in theaters, but many of this year\u2019s Oscar nominees are streaming on various platforms. The AP has this handy guide to help with Oscar cramming.",
      "More than most years, that's a tricky question. The best picture race is seen as unusually wide open, with \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cThe Brutalist,\" \u201cA Complete Unknown,\" \u201cAnora\u201d and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d all with legitimate hopes of winning. In the acting categories, Demi Moore (\"The Substance\") is favored for best actress, Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\") is most likely in best actor, Zoe Salda\u00f1a (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) is the supporting actress frontrunner and Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\") is the favorite for best supporting actor. None of those awards, however, are considered definite locks.",
      "Jacques Audiard's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" a narco-musical about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, comes in with a leading 13 nominations. The film, at one point, seemed like Netflix's best chance yet to land the streamer its first best picture nomination. Its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor nominated for an Oscar.",
      "But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign. After old offensive tweets by Gasc\u00f3n were uncovered, the actress issued an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its flagging campaign.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\" starring Amy Schumer as a woman who fakes a baby bump, is a kinda throwback comedy",
      "We have by now become accustomed to the lengths some movie characters will go to keep a good comedy lie going. But it\u2019s still a special kind of feat when Amy Schumer, playing a baby-mad single woman who fakes a baby bump in \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d is so desperate to maintain the fiction that she shoves a roast turkey up her dress.",
      "You might be thinking: This is too ridiculous. The stuffing, alone. But if we bought \u201cSome Like it Hot\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d I see no reason to quibble with the set-up of \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a funny and often perceptive satire on motherhood, both real and pretend.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which debuted Wednesday on Netflix, is a kinda throwback comedy. Like \u201c40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d and \u201cWedding Crashers,\u201d you can basically get the movie just from its title.",
      "But like any good high-concept comedy, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is predominantly a far-fetched way for its star and co-writer, Schumer, to riff frankly on her chosen topic. Here, that\u2019s the wide gamut of pregnancy experience \u2014 the body changes, the gender reveal parties, the personal jealousies \u2014 all while mixing in a healthy amount of pseudo-pregnant pratfalls.",
      "It\u2019s been a decade since Schumer was essentially launched as a movie star in the 2015 Judd Apatow-directed \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d But \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which Schumer wrote with Julie Paiva, almost as adeptly channels Schumer\u2019s comic voice \u2014 the one that made the sketch series \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d so great.",
      "The movie\u2019s opening flashes back to Lainey (Schumer) as a child playing with dolls and imagining herself a mother-to-be. So committed is she to the role that Lainey, in mock-labor, screams at her friend and then politely apologies: \u201cSorry, but the expectant mother often lashes out at her support system.\u201d",
      "But as middle age approaches, Lainey, a high school teacher in Brooklyn, isn\u2019t close to her dream. At the dinner where she suspects \u2014 no, is so certain that she tears open the desert looking for a ring \u2014 that her longtime boyfriend (Damon Wayans Jr.) is going to pop the question, he instead asks her to join a threesome. Back at school, Lainey\u2019s school lesson on \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d turns darkly cynical.",
      "Things are even worse when Lainey\u2019s married best friend (Jillian Bell) divulges that she\u2019s pregnant. \u201cGet rid of it!\u201d blurts Lainey before apologizing. When the pair later go clothes shopping, Lainey absentmindedly tries on belly padding. The saleswoman is instantly nice to her, offering a burrito and a foot rub. \u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d she asks. \u201cDoor dash,\u201d responds Lainey before adding, \u201cdriver.\u201d",
      "Much of the fun in \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is watching Lainey come up with increasingly ridiculous lies as she tries to pull off the pregnant act. (After accidentally picking Thanksgiving as her time of inception, Lainey digs a deeper hole by suggesting it happened at \u201ca Black Friday Eve sale.\u201d)",
      "But the ruse becomes more difficult when she, during a pregnant workout class, meets a woman (Brianne Howey, refreshingly authentic) she genuinely likes and wants to be friends with. Even more complicated: Lainey starts falling for another guy she first meets at a coffee shop ( Will Forte ).",
      "In a movie filled with funny people (others include Urzila Carlson as a guidance counselor, and Alex Moffat as a idiotic father-to-be) Forte is an especially good presence in \u201cKinda Pregnant.\u201d For a performer of such madcap absurdity, Forte fits in remarkably naturally in a more rom-com setting. He\u2019s also got a wonderfully ridiculous occupation, even by rom-com standards, driving a Zamboni in Central Park.",
      "You can probably guess how \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d goes from here. Director Tyler Spindel, nephew to Adam Sandler (a producer on the film), doesn't do anything to advance the movie comedy, a languishing proposition in recent years with few big-screen exceptions. But he crucially gives his performers plenty of space to be themselves, and Lainey's desperate desire to have a family comes across as both over-the-top and genuine. If \u201cKnocked Up\u201d captured the comedy of getting unexpectedly pregnant, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d embodies the pain of wishing you were.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content, language throughout and drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "Jed Wallace and his company, Street Relations, filed the $7 million lawsuit in federal court in Texas on Tuesday. It says he had nothing to do with any campaign to harm Lively's reputation as she alleged in a court filing.",
      "Wallace is not among the defendants in Lively's federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company and publicists, in which she alleges sexual and other harassment during the production and a campaign to smear her after it. The crisis specialist is named in the court papers and the New York Times story published on the day the series of legal battles began in December when Lively filed a complaint.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that Wallace\u2019s lawsuit \u201cis not just a publicity stunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is transparent retaliation in response to allegations contained within a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint that Ms. Lively filed with the California Civil Rights Department,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile this lawsuit will be dismissed, we are pleased that Mr. Wallace has finally emerged from the shadows, and that he too will be held accountable in federal court.\u201d",
      "In a filing last week in Hays County, Texas, that seeks a deposition from Wallace, Lively alleges he was used by publicists working with Baldoni to weaponize \u201ca digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums.\u201d",
      "Wallace's lawsuit says neither he nor his company \"had anything to do with the alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, failure to investigate or aiding and abetting the alleged harassment or alleged retaliation.\u201d",
      "It says the actor's Texas filing \u201cconceded that Lively has no facts supporting the allegations she made against Wallace and Street,\" which is why she now seeks to investigate the extent of his conduct.",
      "After Lively sued Baldoni, he filed his own federal lawsuit against her and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d star Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "Baldoni had already sued The New York Times for libel, and his former publicist filed a lawsuit taking Lively's side.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a domestic total of nearly $150 million.

      "Plishka died Monday at a hospice in Wilmington, North Carolina, his wife, Sharon Thomas, said Wednesday.",

      "\u201cThese were idols. They were all gods for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing I remember is my costume. I remember under my arms, I was so nervous the perspiration came flowing out like a fire hydrant.\u201d",
      "He sang 88 roles at the Met, and his performance total ranks ninth in the company\u2019s history. While many were as a comprimario, a supporting part surrounding the stars, he sang all three bass roles in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov,\u201d Philip II in Verdi\u2019s \u201cDon Carlo\u201d and for his 25th anniversary with the company the title role in Verdi\u2019s \u201d\u2018Falstaff.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs great as \u2018Don Carlo\u2019 was, the \u2018Falstaff\u2019 really leaves everything in the dust because of the personality of the character and the music.

      "Born Aug. 28, 1941, Plishka grew up in Old Forge, Pennsylvania, and moved with his family to Paterson, New Jersey,. when he was 16. He attended Eastside High School and was directed toward opera by a teacher after he performed Jud Fry in \u201cOklahoma!\u201d Plishka majored in music at Montclair State College and made his opera debut at the Paterson Lyric Opera Theater.",
      "After singing with the Met\u2019s national touring company, he debuted in that 1967 performance. In 1971, he was the Sacristan in Puccini\u2019s \u201cTosca\u201d on the night conductor James Levine made his Met debut.",
      "Plishka said that during rehearsals for those 1971 performances, baritone Peter Glossop pointed to the inexperienced singer and said sarcastically: \u201cThat\u2019s a Sacristan?\u201d By 2012, Plishka said a colleague praised him in rehearsal for making the small role memorable, saying \u201cNow that\u2019s a Sacristan!\u201d",
      "\u201cIt only took 40 years to grow into the part,\u201d Plishka said with a laugh.",
      "He sang with other companies, most notably Milan's Teatro alla Scala, London's Royal Opera and the New York City Opera, and sang the Grand Inquisitor in \u201cDon Carlo\u201d at the 1988 Salzburg Festival. But the vast majority of his career was at the Met. He announced his retirement in 2012, but the Met persuaded him to return for 30 additional performances as the landlord Benoit and Musetta's admirer Alcindoro in \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d from 2016 to 2018.",
      "Plishka's first wife, the former Judith Colgan, died in 2004, and they had three sons who all predeceased him: Paul Jr., Jeffrey and Nikolai.",

      "The irony shouldn\u2019t be lost on anyone that \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about the systemic demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, cannot find a cinematic home, either with a distributor or a major U.S. streamer",
      "The irony shouldn\u2019t be lost on anyone that \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about the systemic demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, cannot find a cinematic home, either with a distributor or a major U.S. streamer.",
      "Producers have opted to self-distribute this powerful, pointed look at Israel's policies in seized land despite the movie earning an Oscar nomination and wins at the Berlin International Film Festival, Gotham Awards and Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. \u201cNo Other Land\u201d is, in its nature, a piece of advocacy. There are no both-sidesing explored here. The filmmakers \u2014 a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four directors \u2014 make it clear they hope documenting their plight will get the United States to pressure Israel to stop the destruction.",
      "The documentary is largely told from the perspective of Basel Adra, an activist born in Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the southern mountains of the occupied West Bank. The Israelis have ordered Palestinians off the land to make room for a military training ground.",
      "Shot between 2019 and 2023 \u2014 filming ended before the Israel-Hamas war exploded \u2014 the bulldozers arrive and never stop, protected by soldiers and ripping through simple concrete homes. The residents retreat to caves, albeit with high-def TV connections. Then they try to rebuild, often under the stealth of night. Then the bulldozers return.",
      "\u201cThey destroy us slowly. Every week, a home,\u201d goes the narration. \u201cEvery week a new family must decide: Endure, or leave their land.\u201d",
      "Adra and Palestinian co-writer and co-director Hamdan Ballal are joined by an Israeli journalist, Yuval Abraham, who arrives in Masafer Yatta with the cinematographer Rachel Szor. Abraham is asked point blank on his arrival: \u201cWhat do you think about what your country is doing to us?\u201d His answer: \u201cI think it\u2019s a crime.\u201d",
      "It is a wrenching movie to see: Soldiers, with vague permission from a court that Palestinians have no say in, push old women and children, not answering their pleas to stop and merely waving away residents whose families have lived in the region since the 1830s. The residents can't vote and their license plates set them apart from Israelis. They're hoping enough likes on social media can change their plight.",
      "We see women carrying out their rugs from rubble and children bewildered as their outhouse is knocked down.",
      "\u201cWe have no other land,\u201d says one resident, giving the documentary its name. At one point, a playground is demolished. At another, a school. Then a well is filled with concrete and water lines are cut with a chainsaw. Sometimes, nearby Israeli settlers attack as soldiers stand by.",
      "The Palestinians are unarmed, except for cellphone cameras, which the soldiers clearly hate. When they march \u2014 a ragtag group with a banner reading \u201cPalestinian Lives Matter\u201d \u2014 they are met with stun grenades.",
      "Shaky cellphone footage of military altercations mix with archive footage, TV newscasts and dreamy, languid shots of dusty villages at night lit by naked bulbs. Sometimes current day images melt to those of a generation ago, when in home movies we see Adra's father protesting the same injustices, a never-ending cycle. His first memory is his father\u2019s first arrest.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d is a piece of resistance but also humanization. When Adra is about to be arrested, his mother says what mothers regularly do: \u201cGo wear a warmer coat,\u201d she counsels. Palestinian children laugh as they play games in the street, throw snowballs in winter and sway gleefully from makeshift swings.",
      "\u201cI hope we\u2019ll change this bad reality,\u201d says Adra at the end. \u201cI hope,\u201d chimes in Abraham.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d in movie theaters in select cities, is not rated but has language and violence throughout. Running time: 95 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Women like her are the stewards of one of Morocco\u2019s most cherished oral traditions: a form of folk singing known as aita, which means a \u201ccry\u201d or \u201clament\u201d in Arabic. From smoky bars and cabarets in Morocco\u2019s largest cities to the gatherings in the country\u2019s rural regions, they croon at weddings, festivals and private events and pub nights, hypnotizing audiences both humble and wealthy.",
      "But despite aita's position in Moroccan culture, the genre\u2019s popularity does not always translate into acceptance for those who perform it. Cheikha are often stigmatized, eroticized, and pushed to society\u2019s margins. That was once a fear for Moullablad, but she says her community in Sidi Yahya Zaer, a farming town on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic plains, has mostly accepted her.",
      "\u201cMy family did not agree at first and I used to suffer from society\u2019s judgment, but now everything is good,\u201d Moullablad said on the sidelines of a recent performance south of Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat. \u201cI do it in order to earn money for my children.\u201d",
      "A form of sung poetry, aita has long explored themes of societal triumphs, ironies, and unspoken struggles, including those related to relationships and economic hardship. Cheikha don heavy stage makeup, silk caftans, and golden takchita belts as they sing about their community's agonies and triumphs. They sway their hips to amplify emotion, dancing seductively or cheerfully depending on the context.",
      "When Moullablad performs, men and women lean in as her voice softens, captivated as she climbs octaves into a full-throated howl. The beads wrapped around her sister Fatiha\u2019s belly shake as she dances. The band leader, another singer, backs her with his own poetry while a drummer keeps the beat, a guitarist strums, and a violinist drags his bow in sync.",
      "Those who come to hear them sing say cheikha can serve as a community's truth-tellers, singing about often unspoken dynamics related to marriage, agriculture or, historically, colonial resistance. Moullablad sings in Moroccan Arabic, embodying traditions specific to her community. But cheikha across the North African Kingdom also perform in the indigenous Amazigh language, adapting the music and lyrics to reflect their region.",
      "The art form has inspired contemporary acts like the electro-infused \u201cAita, Mon Amour\u201d and Kabareh Cheikhats, a troupe of male actors who pay homage, dress and sing in the tune of Morocco's most celebrated 20th century women folk singers. It is also the subject of Morocco\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s Academy Awards, \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d which follows a single mother who leaves her town in the Atlas Mountains to pursue her dream of singing in bars, cabarets, and hotels in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cI was always amazed by their strength and the power that they have toward people when they open their mouths. Whether they are modern or conservative people, they all stand up and get into a kind of trance like gospel,\u201d Nabil Ayouch, the film\u2019s director, said in an interview when the film premiered at the Marrakech Film Festival last year.",
      "Morocco\u2019s music scene is increasingly embracing Middle Eastern pop and rap by North African artists from throughout the diaspora. And rural communities are shrinking amid the country's rapid development and urbanization. But though the future of aita may seem uncertain, its musicians and listeners remain confident that it will endure.",
      "\u201cAita will not die because it is renewed by young people. Aita will remain in all times and is loved by old people and young people as well. It is developed and improved, but they preserve its origins,\u201d said Rachid Kadari, a Cheikh who also sings aita."

      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning the trophy for album of the year was the highlight of the Grammy Awards on Sunday, but there were plenty of other key moments",
      "All eyes at the Grammy Awards were on whether the most-nominated artist in the history of the telecast would finally walk away with the coveted album of the year trophy. She did. \u201cWe finally saw it happen,\u201d host Trevor Noah said, almost in relief.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning for \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d capped a night that turned into a tribute to a suffering Los Angeles, with city firefighters chosen to reveal the winner of the last award and speeches offering words of encouragement for communities devastated. The Grammys almost veered into a telethon; $7 million was pledged from viewers of the show.",
      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",
      "Lady Gaga, accepting the trophy for best pop duo or group alongside Bruno Mars for their chart-topping collab, \u201cDie with a Smile,\u201d gave a shout-out to the trans community, targets of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love,\" Lady Gaga said.",
      "Not long after, Alicia Keys, being honored with The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, also backed diversity and inclusion programs, another Trump target.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\u201d said Keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen on this stage talented, hardworking people from different backgrounds with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift.\u201d",
      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members. The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new since we started our transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few years, we have listened, we\u2019ve acted and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "Mason then introduced The Weeknd, who performed two tunes from his just-released album \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d \u2014 \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with special guest Playboi Carti. He wore a long druid's robe and the stage was smoky.",
      "Will Smith, hosting a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, marked his first appearance at a major awards show since since he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars in 2022.",
      "\u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say, he changed mine forever. You probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith has been banned from film academy ceremonies for 10 years but the Grammys are a different beast. He made no mention of the infamous Slap.",
      "Smith has previously nabbed Grammy wins in the short form music video (\u201cWill 2K\u201d), best rap solo performance (\u201cGetting\u2019 Jiggy Wit It,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d), and best rap performance by a duo or group (\u201cSummertime\u201d as the Fresh Prince with DJ Jazzy Jeff).",

    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is standing trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could.",
      "But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder.",
      "Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial",
      "Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

    "story": [
      "A woman from New Zealand says in lawsuits that British author Neil Gaiman sexually assaulted her repeatedly when she worked as a babysitter and nanny for him and his wife",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A woman from New Zealand has filed three civil lawsuits against best-selling British author Neil Gaiman and his wife, accusing Gaiman of repeatedly sexually assaulting her while she was working as the couple's babysitter and nanny.",
      "Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York on Monday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Gaiman's wife, Amanda Palmer, invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, eventually becoming the couple's nanny.",
      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",
      "Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman\u2019s \u201cThe Graveyard Book,\u201d while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on \u201cThe Sandman.\u201d"

      "The testimony from the trial\u2019s key witness, who goes by A$AP Relli, came at the end of a long, frustrating slog on the stand in a Los Angeles courtroom that drove him to shout, \u201cYou're annoying, bro!\u201d and much more at the lead defense attorney.",
      "In its re-direct questioning on Monday, the prosecution pushed back against the idea that for security Rocky carried a starter pistol that only shot blanks.",

      "A day earlier, the hip-hop star was up a Grammy Award for the third time at a ceremony just two miles away, but lost to one of the night\u2019s big winners, Kendrick Lamar.",
      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",

      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",
      "\u201cOnce I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" says the recording that Sajimi testified he made in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the DA to find me. Because I\u2019m going to be on another island.\u201d",
      "Sajimi testified that he builds websites for artists and brands, and has worked with both Rocky and Relli, but said he is much closer to Rocky, who he considers a friend."

      "PARIS -- A Paris court found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country\u2019s first big #MeToo trial.",
      "Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie \u201cLes Diables,\u201d or \u201cThe Devils,\u201d in the early 2000s.",
      "Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women\u2019s rights activists as she left the courtroom.",
      "The court ruled that Ruggia \u201ctook advantage of the dominant position\u201d he had on Haenel at the time. \u201cDuring quasi-weekly meetings at your home for over three years you had sexualized gestures and attitudes,\u201d as Haenel was \u201cgradually isolated\u201d from her loved ones, the court said in a statement.",
      "Ruggia's lawyer said her client would appeal.",
      "He \u201cmaintains that he has never touched Ad\u00e8le Haenel,\u201d the lawyer, Fanny Colin, said. \u201cSentenced in these conditions and on the sole basis of her words seems to us not only unjustified but dangerous.\u201d",
      "Haenel, star of the 2019 Cannes entry \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d has in recent years vocally protested what she\u2019s called an insufficient response to sexual abuse in French filmmaking.",
      "At the C\u00e9sar Awards in 2020, she walked out of the ceremony after Roman Polanski won best director. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.",
      "In 2023, Haenel, announced she was quitting the French film industry that she denounced for \u201ccomplacency toward sexual aggressors.\u201d She published an open letter in which she said Cannes and other pillars of the French film industry are \u201cready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs.\u201d",
      "While #MeToo initially struggled to find traction in France, some other actors and film industry workers have since spoken out.",
      "French renowned actor Judith Godr\u00e8che attended Monday\u2019s verdict at the Paris courthouse. \u201cIt was a very moving and a very important moment that reminded me of things that, in my case, may go unpunished,\u201d she told reporters with tears in her eyes.",
      "Last year, Godr\u00e8che accused film director Beno\u00eet Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024.",

      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

      "A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits company alleging their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 jump in the cost of his asthma medication",
      "LA CROSSE, Wis. -- A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits management company, alleging that their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 spike in his asthma medication.",
      "Shanon and William Schmidtknecht, of Poynette, filed their lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee on Jan. 21, a year to the day that their son Cole died at age 22.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Cole Schmidtknecht suffered from asthma all his life. He managed it with daily doses of the medication Advair Diskus and its generic equivalents, which he ingested through an inhaler.",
      "He stopped at a Walgreens pharmacy in Appleton on Jan. 10, 2024, to refill his prescription and was told the cost had jumped from $66 to $539 out-of-pocket. Unable to afford the new cost, he left the pharmacy without the medication. He tried to manage his condition with his rescue inhaler but suffered a fatal asthma attack days later, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The Schmidtknechts allege that pharmacy benefits management company OptumRX violated Wisconsin law by raising the cost of the medication without a valid medical reason and failing to provide 30 days' advance notice of drug price increases.",
      "Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health insurance companies, prescription drug companies and pharmacies. Optum Rx services prescription claims for more than 66 million people across the United States, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Walgreens pharmacy staffers failed to offer Cole any workarounds to obtain his usual medication. They told him there were no cheaper alternatives or generic medications available, they didn't contact OptumRx to request an exception on Cole's behalf, and they didn't ask Cole's doctor to request an exception for him, his parents contend.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.",
      "\u201cThe conduct of both OptumRx and Walgreens was deplorable,\u201d one of the family's attorneys, Michael Trunk, said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence in this case will show that both OptumRx and Walgreens put profits first, and are directly responsible for Cole\u2019s death.\"",
      "OptumRx spokespeople didn't immediately reply to Wednesday messages seeking comment. In a statement last April extending sympathy to the family, the company said that a review of Cole's claims showed that on the day he visited the pharmacy, he did buy a different asthma medication, generic Albuterol, for a $5 co-pay on Jan. 10 \u2014 a medication that it says he also obtained in October 2023. His case was handled \u201cconsistent with industry practice and the patient's insurance plan design,\u201d the company said.",
      "Trunk, though, said Wednesday that the $5 generic prescription Cole filled was for his rescue inhaler, not the Advair Diskus inhaler that he took daily. He said Cole was not able to fill his Advair Diskus prescription because it had suddenly become too expensive.",
      "Walgreens officials didn't immediately respond to a Wednesday email seeking comment on the lawsuit."

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association said they were in close contact with member hospitals about the gender-affirming care executive order.",
      "\u201cWe are collaboratively working through every aspect of the EO to determine its legal and clinical implications. That work is ongoing,\u201d Brian Conway said in an email.",
      "Gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth is not common but such treatments have been the subject of fierce political debate. Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a new study."

      "Ugandan authorities have begun a clinical trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan authorities on Monday began a clinical trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week.",
      "Health workers and others exposed to the Ebola strain are being targeted in the study, which began four days after Uganda announced the death of a nurse in the capital, Kampala. Two more cases were confirmed on Monday in relatives of the first victim.",
      "Officials are investigating the source of the outbreak. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said he also sought the services of a traditional healer.",
      "At least 234 contacts in this outbreak have been identified, according to the Ministry of Health.",
      "Health authorities have access to more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain. IAVI provided the vaccine.",
      "The trial \u201cmarks a major milestone in public health emergency response and demonstrates the power of collaboration for global health security,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO director for Africa, said in a statement.",
      "This is the first Ebola outbreak since the Trump administration's decision last week to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, and since Trump's order for a freeze on foreign assistance.",
      "Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever.",
      "A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there.",
      "The confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease last month, and Rwanda in December announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat.",
      "Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's effort to ban federal funding for gender-affirming care for young people is facing a legal challenge",
      "Seven families with transgender or nonbinary children filed a lawsuit Tuesday over President Donald Trump's executive orders to narrowly define the sexes and halt federal support for gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19.",
      "PFLAG, a national group for family of LGBTQ+ people; and GLMA, a doctors organization, are also plaintiffs in the court challenge in a Baltimore federal court.",
      "It comes one week after Trump signed an order calling for the federal government to stop funding the medical care through federal government-run health insurance programs including Medicaid and TRICARE.",
      "Kristen Chapman, the mother of one of the plaintiffs in the case, said her family moved to Richmond, Virginia, from Tennessee in 2023 because of a ban on gender-affirming care in their home state. Her 17-year-old daughter, Willow, had an initial appointment scheduled for last week with a new provider who would accept Medicaid. But Trump signed his order the day before and the hospital said it could not provide care.",
      "\u201cI thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter,\u201d Kristen Chapman said in a statement. \"Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "She's not the only one, Brian Bond, the CEO of PFLAG, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe are receiving a drumbeat of calls from parents whose kids' care is being canceled.\u201d",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing the plaintiffs, want a judge to put the order on hold. In a court filing Tuesday, they said Trump's executive orders are \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d because they seek to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because they violate antidiscrimination laws. The challenge also says that the order infringes on the rights of parents.",
      "Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, they also argue that the policy discriminates because it does not prohibit federal funds for the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Some health providers immediately paused providing the coverage while they assess how the order affects them. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly battled Trump in court, told hospitals in her state Monday that it would violate the law to stop offering gender-affirming care to people under 19.",
      "Josh Block, an ACLU lawyer on the case, said that medical providers should continue gender-affirming care for people under 19. \u201cIt should not take either a protest, a letter from the attorney general or a TRO,\u201d or temporary restraining order from the court for them to do so.",
      "Trump's approach on transgender policy represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people.",
      "Trump has used strong language, asserting in the order on gender-affirming care that \"medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, the doctors group in the legal challenge, said there are established medical standards for caring for transgender youth. \u201cNow, an extreme political agenda is trying to overrule that expertise, putting young people and their providers in danger,\" Sheldon said in a statement. \"We are confident that the law, science, and history are on our side.\u201d",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Legal challenges have already been filed on the military order and a plan to move transgender women in federal prisons to men's facilities. Others are expected to be filed, just as there have been challenges to a variety of Trump's policies.",
      "Researchers have found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents receive the care, which includes treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries \u2014 though surgery is rare for children.",
      "As transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in some ways, there's been vehement pushback. At least 26 states have passed laws to restrict or ban the care for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year but has not yet ruled on whether Tennessee's ban on the care is constitutional.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has asked state legislators to double their spending to date on Hurricane Helene recovery and approve it now",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.",
      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma after Rwanda-backed rebels captured the major city in eastern Congo last week",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",

      "In an executive order issued Tuesday, DeWine required all permanent employees of state agencies, boards and commissions to resume five-day, in-office work weeks no later than March 17. He said the move will allow the state to best serve the public and to make best use of its remaining office space. Both are in the best interests of Ohio citizens, he wrote.",
      "The return date set by DeWine falls almost five years to the day after the state declared an emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 9, 2020, and allowed certain employees to work remotely.",
      "Many of those workers either returned to their offices full-time or on a hybrid basis starting in June 2021, when the emergency was lifted.",
      "Tuesday's order requires virtually all employees to now return. It allows agencies to grant exceptions in cases where some or all of their real estate portfolios have been eliminated. Lease terminations and space reallocations that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic saved Ohio taxpayers millions of dollars, the order says.",
      "According to the document, a majority of Ohio's state employees actually never worked remotely, due to the nature of their work at state hospitals, prisons, law enforcement agencies or in other jobs requiring a physical presence.",
      "DeWine's mandate comes as some major Columbus employers, including American Electric Power and JPMorganChase, also have required a return to five-day work weeks in March. Republican President Donald Trump also is requiring federal workers to return full-time to offices, an order that's as part of an unprecedented series of steps aimed at shrinking the federal government."

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday for treatment",
      "RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt -- A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing on Saturday, the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago.",
      "The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed last month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egypt's Al-Qahera television showed at least two Palestinian Red Cross ambulances pulling up to the crossing gate. Several children were brought out on gurneys and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. From there, they were rushed to hospitals in the nearby Egyptian city of el-Arish and elsewhere. Footage showed one young girl whose foot had been amputated.",
      "Zaher al-Wahidi, an official with Gaza's Health Ministry, said 37 of the children had crossed into Egypt by Saturday evening.",
      "The Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "The children are the first in what are meant to be regular evacuations of Palestinians through the crossing for treatment abroad.",
      "Over the past 15 months, Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "The World Health Organization chief is asking global leaders to lean on Washington to reverse President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency",
      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization chief asked global leaders to lean on Washington to reverse President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, insisting in a closed-door meeting with diplomats last week that the U.S. will miss out on critical information about global disease outbreaks.",
      "But countries also pressed WHO at a key budget meeting last Wednesday about how it might cope with the exit of its biggest donor, according to internal meeting materials obtained by The Associated Press. A German envoy, Bjorn Kummel, warned: \u201cThe roof is on fire, and we need to stop the fire as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",
      "A budget document presented at the meeting showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash. \u201cReadiness functions\u201d in WHO\u2019s Europe office were more than 80% reliant on the $154 million the U.S. contributes.",
      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",
      "The U.S. also covers 95% of WHO's tuberculosis work in Europe and more than 60% of TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific and at the agency headquarters in Geneva, the document said.",
      "At a separate private meeting on the impact of the U.S. exit last Wednesday, WHO finance director George Kyriacou said if the agency spends at its current rate, the organization would \u201cbe very much in a hand-to-mouth type situation when it comes to our cash flows\u201d in the first half of 2026. He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s executive order, WHO has attempted to withdraw funds from the U.S. for past expenses, Kyriacou said, but most of those \u201chave not been accepted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has yet to settle its owed contributions to WHO for 2024, pushing the agency into a deficit, he added.",
      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the attendees at the budget meeting that the agency is still providing U.S. scientists with some data \u2014 though it isn't known what data.",
      "\u201cWe continue to give them information because they need it,\u201d Tedros said, urging member countries to contact U.S officials. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you continue to push and reach out to them to reconsider.\u201d",
      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office. In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",
      "Tedros also said he believed the U.S. departure was \u201cnot about the money\u201d but more about the \u201cvoid\u201d in outbreak details and other critical health information that the United States would face in the future.",
      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",
      "Kummel, a senior advisor on global health in Germany's health ministry, described the U.S. exit as \u201cthe most extensive crisis WHO has been facing in the past decades.\u201d",
      "He also asked: \u201cWhat concrete functions of WHO will collapse if the funding of the U.S. is not existent anymore?\u201d",
      "Officials from countries including Bangladesh and France asked what specific plans WHO had to deal with the loss of U.S. funding and wondered which health programs would be cut as a result.",
      "The AP obtained a document shared among some WHO senior managers that laid out several options, including a proposal that each major department or office might be slashed in half by the end of the year.",
      "WHO declined to comment on whether Tedros had privately asked countries to lobby on the agency's behalf.",
      "Some experts said that while the departure of the U.S. was a major crisis, it might also serve as an opportunity to reshape global public health.",
      "Less than 1% of the U.S. health budget goes to WHO, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics. In exchange, the U.S. gets \u201ca wide variety of benefits to Americans that matter quite a bit,\u201d he said. That includes intelligence about disease epidemics globally and virus samples for vaccines.",
      "Kavanagh also said the WHO is \"massively underfunded,\u201d describing the contributions from rich countries as \u201cpeanuts.\u201d",
      "WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said at the meeting on the impact of the U.S. withdrawal last week that losing the U.S. was \u201cterrible,\u201d but member states had \u201ctremendous capacity to fill in those gaps.\u201d",
      "Ryan told WHO member countries: \u201cThe U.S. is leaving a community of nations. It\u2019s essentially breaking up with you.\u201d",
      "Kavanagh doubted the U.S. would be able to match WHO's ability to gather details about emerging health threats globally, and said its exit from the agency \u201cwill absolutely lead to worse health outcomes for Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow much worse remains to be seen,\u201d Kavanagh said.",

    "story": [
      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

      "A New York doctor has been indicted by a Lousiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

His house in northern Gaza was destroyed. He and surviving family now live in a tent set up in the rubble of his home.",
      "But he says he will not be driven out, after President Donald Trump called for transferring all Palestinians from Gaza so the United States could take over the devastated territory and rebuild it for others. Rights groups said his comments were tantamount to a call for \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and forcible expulsion.",
      "\u201cWe categorically reject and will resist any plans to deport and transfer us from our land,\u201d he said from the Jabaliya refugee camp.",
      "Trump\u2019s call for depopulating Gaza has stunned Palestinians. Hundreds of thousands in the territory rushed to return to their homes \u2013 even if destroyed \u2013 as soon as they could following the ceasefire reached last month between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Though some experts speculated that Trump's proposal might be a negotiating tactic, Palestinians across the region saw in it an effort to erase them completely from their homeland, a continuation of the expulsion and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.",
      "That event is known among Palestinians as the \u201cNakba,\u201d Arabic for the \u201cCatastrophe.\u201d Trump's statement \u2014 a wild swing away from years of U.S. policy \u2014 meshed with calls from far-right politicians in Israel to push Palestinians out of Gaza, particularly into Egypt.",

      "Like many, Abu Elaish could point to his own family\u2019s experience. In May 1948, Israeli forces expelled his grandparents and other Palestinians and demolished their homes in the village of Hoj in what\u2019s now southern Israel just outside the Gaza Strip, he said. The family resettled in Gaza\u2019s Jabaliya camp, which over the decades grew into a densely built urban neighborhood. Israeli troops leveled most of the district during fierce fighting with Hamas militants over recent months.",
      "Mustafa al-Gazzar was 5 years old, he said, when his family and other residents were forced to flee as Israeli forces in 1948 attacked their town of Yabneh in what is now central Israel.",
      "Now in his 80s, he sat outside his home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, flattened by an airstrike, and said it was unthinkable to go after surviving 15 months of war.",
      "\u201cAre you crazy, you think I would leave?\u201d he said. \u201cYou think you\u2019ll expel me abroad and bring other people in my place? \u2026 I would rather live in my tent, under rubble. I won\u2019t leave. Put that in your brain.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of being sent abroad, I should return to my original land where I was born and will die,\u201d he said, referring to Yabneh, located near what is now the central Israeli city of Yavneh. He said Trump should be seeking a two-state solution. \u201cThis is the ideal, clear solution, peace for the Israelis and peace for the Palestinians, living side by side,\u201d he said.",
      "In his comments Tuesday alongside visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said Palestinians from Gaza should be resettled in lands in Egypt, Jordan or elsewhere, promising them a \u201cbeautiful place.\u201d Egypt and Jordan have both rejected Trump\u2019s call to resettle Palestinians on their soil.",
      "Trump said the U.S. would take over Gaza and rebuild it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d for \u201cthe world\u2019s people,\u201d dismissing the idea that Palestinians would refuse to leave or want to return.",

      "Throughout the 15-month war in Gaza, many Palestinians expressed fear that Israel\u2019s goal was to drive the population into neighboring Egypt. The government denied that aim, though some hard-right members of the coalition called for encouraging Palestinians to leave Gaza and for restoring Jewish settlements there.

      "Immigration, a Trump administration priority, has been the major focus of Rubio\u2019s first foreign trip as America\u2019s top diplomat, a five-country tour spanning Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "The agreements with El Salvador and Guatemala potentially help the Trump administration address what has always been a key sticking point in immigration enforcement since not everyone in the U.S. illegally can be easily sent back home.",
      "Venezuela, for example, has been a major source of migrants coming to the U.S. in recent years, but rarely can the U.S. deport Venezuelans back to their home country. But the U.S. already has a robust network set up to send people to several Central American countries.",
      "Guatemala will expand its capacity to receive not just Guatemalans, but also migrants from other countries who will then be repatriated to their home countries. The details still need to be worked out.",
      "\u201cHowever, the permanent answer to immigration is to bring development so that no one has to leave the country,\u201d Ar\u00e9valo said. To that end, a high-level Guatemalan delegation, including from the private sector, will travel to Washington in the coming weeks.",
      "Ar\u00e9valo also announced the formation of a new border security force that will patrol Guatemala\u2019s borders with Honduras and El Salvador. The force will be made up of police and soldiers and will combat transnational crime of all kinds, he said.",
      "Rubio's trip has been dogged by the administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, including a late Tuesday order abruptly pulling almost all agency staffers off the job.",
      "After the news conference with Guatemala's president, Rubio headed directly to the U.S. Embassy, where staffers and their families who were unsure of their futures gathered to hear from their new boss.",
      "The meet-and-greet event was closed to the press, as was an earlier similar event in El Salvador. Both Guatemala and El Salvador have significant USAID missions. In Panama on Sunday before the shut down announcement, Rubio\u2019s embassy event had been open to journalists.",
      "From there Rubio wrapped up his Guatemala stop by visiting a local migration facility near an air force base where deportees are processed for integration back into their home communities. Under the measures announced Wednesday by Guatemala\u2019s president, the number of deportees is expected to rise by as much as 40%. The program has been supported by the U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Rubio also got a briefing on Guatemala\u2019s counternarcotics efforts, including the interception of at least four shipments of fentanyl precursors since late November totaling 127.5 kilograms (280 pounds), enough to produce more than 114 million doses of the drug.",
      "Rubio, who has offered exemptions to Trump\u2019s sweeping freeze on foreign assistance, has signed waivers to allow funding for both programs to continue, officials said.",
      "\u201cThis is an example of foreign aid that\u2019s in our national interest. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve issued a waiver for these programs. That\u2019s why these programs are coming back online. And they will be functioning because it\u2019s a way of showing to the American people this is the kind of foreign aid that\u2019s aligned with our foreign policy, with our national interest,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio also spoke Wednesday with Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente to discuss ways to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, fight fentanyl and transnational criminal organizations and end illegal immigration, according to a State Department statement.",

      "U.K. scientists say they have made a historic breakthrough by making the first image of the inside of a scroll carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists hope a mix of artificial intelligence and human expertise will help decipher ancient scrolls carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago.",
      "Hundreds of papyrus scrolls were found in the 1750s in the remains of a lavish villa at the Roman town of Herculaneum, which along with neighboring Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.",
      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",
      "Scholars and scientists have worked for more than 250 years on ways to decipher the scrolls, the vast majority of which are held in the National Library of Naples.",
      "In 2023, several tech executives sponsored the \u201cVesuvius Challenge\u201d competition, offering cash rewards for efforts to decipher the scrolls with machine learning, computer vision and geometry.",
      "On Wednesday, the challenge announced a \u201chistoric breakthrough,\u201d saying researchers had managed to generate the first image of the inside of one of the three scrolls held at Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library.",
      "University of Kentucky computer scientist Brent Seales, co-founder of the Vesuvius Challenge, said the organizers were \u201cthrilled with the successful imaging of this scroll.\u201d He said it \u201ccontains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll.\u201d",
      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",
      "Scientists then used AI to piece together the images, search for ink that reveals where there is writing, and enhance the clarity of the text. The process led to a 3D image of the scroll that allowed experts to unroll it virtually, using a process called segmentation.",
      "AI, as it stands, has its limits. Little of the text has been deciphered so far. One of the few words that has been made out is the ancient Greek for \u201cdisgust.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are still at the beginning of a long process,\u201d Peter Toth, the Cornelia Starks Curator of Greek Collections at the Bodleian, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe need better images, and they are very positive and very, very confident that they can still improve the image quality and the legibility of the text.\u201d",
      "Toth also laid out his hope that the technology can be made available locally so that the other two fragile scrolls won't have to be transported to Diamond\u2019s headquarters.",

      "Palestinians will mark this year the 77th anniversary of their mass expulsion from what is now Israel",
      "JERUSALEM -- Palestinians will mark this year the 77th anniversary of their mass expulsion from what is now Israel, an event that is at the core of their national struggle.",
      "But in many ways, that experience pales in comparison to the calamity now faced in the Gaza Strip \u2014 particularly as President Donald Trump has suggested that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and that the United States take \u201cownership\u201d of the enclave.",
      "Palestinians refer to their 1948 expulsion as the Nakba, Arabic for catastrophe. Some 700,000 Palestinians \u2014 a majority of the prewar population \u2014 fled or were driven from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel's establishment.",
      "After the war, Israel refused to allow them to return because it would have resulted in a Palestinian majority within its borders. Instead, they became a seemingly permanent refugee community that now numbers some 6 million, with most living in slum-like urban refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "In Gaza, the refugees and their descendants make up around three-quarters of the population.",
      "Israel's rejection of what Palestinians say is their right of return to their 1948 homes has been a core grievance in the conflict and was one of the thorniest issues in peace talks that last collapsed 15 years ago. The refugee camps have always been the main bastions of Palestinian militancy.",
      "Now, many Palestinians fear a repeat of their painful history on an even more cataclysmic scale.",
      "All across Gaza, Palestinians in recent days have been loading up cars and donkey carts or setting out on foot to visit their destroyed homes after a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war took hold Jan. 19. The images from several rounds of mass evacuations throughout the war \u2014 and their march back north on foot \u2014 are strikingly similar to black-and-white photographs from 1948.",
      "Mustafa al-Gazzar, in his 80s, recalled in 2024 his family's monthslong flight from their village in what is now central Israel to the southern city of Rafah, when he was 5. At one point they were bombed from the air, at another, they dug holes under a tree to sleep in for warmth.",
      "Al-Gazzar, now a great-grandfather, was forced to flee again in the war, this time to a tent in Muwasi, a barren coastal area where some 450,000 Palestinians live in a squalid camp. He said then the conditions are worse than in 1948, when the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees was able to regularly provide food and other essentials.",
      "\u201cMy hope in 1948 was to return, but my hope today is to survive,\u201d he said.",
      "The war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, making it by far the deadliest round of fighting in the history of the conflict. The initial Hamas attack killed some 1,200 Israelis.",
      "The war has forced some 1.7 million Palestinians \u2014 around three quarters of the territory's population \u2014 to flee their homes, often multiple times. That is well over twice the number that fled before and during the 1948 war.",
      "Israel has sealed its border. Egypt has only allowed a small number of Palestinians to leave, in part because it fears a mass influx of Palestinians could generate another long-term refugee crisis.",
      "The international community is strongly opposed to any mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza \u2014 an idea embraced by far-right members of the Israeli government, who refer to it as \u201cvoluntary emigration.\u201d",
      "Israel has long called for the refugees of 1948 to be absorbed into host countries, saying that calls for their return are unrealistic and would endanger its existence as a Jewish-majority state. It points to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who came to Israel from Arab countries during the turmoil following its establishment, though few of them want to return.",
      "Even if Palestinians are not expelled from Gaza en masse, many fear that they will never be able to return to their homes or that the destruction wreaked on the territory will make it impossible to live there. One U.N. estimate said it would take until 2040 to rebuild destroyed homes.",
      "The Jewish militias in the 1948 war with the armies of neighboring Arab nations were mainly armed with lighter weapons like rifles, machine guns and mortars. Hundreds of depopulated Palestinian villages were demolished after the war, while Israelis moved into Palestinian homes in Jerusalem, Jaffa and other cities.",
      "In Gaza, Israel has unleashed one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history, at times dropping 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs on dense, residential areas. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to wastelands of rubble and plowed-up roads, many littered with unexploded bombs.",
      "Yara Asi, a Palestinian assistant professor at the University of Central Florida who has done research on the damage to civilian infrastructure in the war, says it's \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to imagine the kind of international effort that would be necessary to rebuild Gaza.",
      "Even before the war, many Palestinians spoke of an ongoing Nakba, in which Israel gradually forces them out of Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories it captured during the 1967 war that the Palestinians want for a future state. They point to home demolitions, settlement construction and other discriminatory policies that long predate the war, and which major rights groups say amount to apartheid, allegations Israel denies.",
      "Asi and others fear that if another genuine Nakba occurs, it will be in the form of a gradual departure.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be called forcible displacement in some cases. It will be called emigration, it will be called something else,\" Asi said.",

      "The attack, which showed a deep infiltration into Hezbollah\u2019s ranks and its operations, wounded thousands of people and killed at least nine. It was carried out Sept. 18, 2024, just as fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group was escalating, culminating in the deaths of multiple Hezbollah leaders and an eventual ceasefire after months of cross-border violence.",

      "Thousands of protesters in Bangladesh have taken out their anger at exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by destroying a family home that came to symbolize the country\u2019s independence \u2014 and now, they say, the authoritarianism they believe she led",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Thousands of protesters in Bangladesh took out their anger at exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday by destroying a family home that came to symbolize the country's independence \u2014 and now, they say, the authoritarianism they believe she led.",
      "The attack was sparked by a speech Hasina planned to give to supporters from exile in neighboring India, where she fled last year during a deadly student-led uprising against her 15-year rule. Critics had accused her of suppressing dissent.",
      "The house in the capital, Dhaka, had been home to Hasina's late father and Bangladesh\u2019s independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who declared the country's formal break from Pakistan there in 1971. He was assassinated there in 1975. Hasina later turned the home into a museum.",
      "Since she fled the country, some of her supporters have tried to gather there but have been attacked by Hasina's critics, who have attacked other symbols of her government and party since the uprising, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.",
      "On Wednesday, some protesters threatened to \u201cbulldoze\u201d the building if the former prime minister went ahead with her speech, which marked the start of a month-long protest program by her Awami League political party. The party is trying to gain support amid allegations of attacks on its members and other Hasina backers.",
      "As Hasina began speaking, protesters stormed the house and started dismantling the brick walls, later bringing a crane and an excavator to demolish the building.",
      "\u201cThey do not have the power to destroy the country\u2019s independence with bulldozers. They may destroy a building, but they won\u2019t be able to erase the history,\u201d Hasina said in response during her speech, even as the demolition continued.",

      "Many of the protesters chanted slogans demanding Hasina's execution for hundreds of deaths during last year's uprising against her. It was some of the country's worst upheaval since independence. Hasina urged a U.N. investigation into the deaths.",
      "They also chanted slogans criticizing India. An interim government in Bangladesh led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has sought Hasina's extradition but India has not responded.",
      "The interim government, which has been struggling to maintain order and prevent mob justice against Hasina's supporters, has accused the former prime minister of widespread corruption and human rights abuses during her rule that began in 2009.",
      "Hasina's Awami League in turn has accused the Yunus-led government of violating human rights and suppressing Bangladesh's minority groups, which authorities have denied."

    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Donald Trump's \u201cinfluential\u201d billionaire adviser Elon Musk a day after the new U.S. president promised to cut funding for South Africa over a land expropriation law, Ramaphosa's spokesperson said Wednesday.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s conversation with Musk was \u201clogical,\u201d spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said, because the South African-born Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur has held previous investment-related discussions with Ramaphosa and is a Trump ally.",
      "The land law, which was signed by Ramaphosa last month, is contentious because it gives the government scope to expropriate land from private parties.",
      "Trump announced Sunday that he would stop financial assistance while the U.S. investigated why South Africa was \u201cconfiscating land\u201d from some people, without saying who. He told reporters wrongly that the South African government was taking away land and \u201cactually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d Trump again didn\u2019t provide details.",
      "The South African government said Trump\u2019s announcement and related criticism of the country by Musk was full of \u201cmisinformation and distortions\u201d and the call to Musk was to set the record straight.",
      "Musk, who is leading the Trump administration\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, has long criticized the government in his homeland, a key U.S. trading partner in Africa, as being anti-white and has cast the law in question as a deliberate act to take land away from its white minority.",
      "He faces scrutiny in the U.S. for his control over parts of the federal government, but the South Africa issue also shows his influence on U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Should Trump follow through on his promise to cut South Africa\u2019s funding, it would stop nearly half a billion dollars a year in assistance, the vast majority of it for the world\u2019s biggest HIV/AIDS program.",
      "South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world at more than 8 million, with around 5.5 million on antiretroviral medication. The U.S. funds around 17% of South Africa's HIV program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, and gave the country $440 million in assistance last year.",
      "The South African government said no land has been confiscated, and even groups in South Africa that have been critical of the new law said Trump was wrong in claiming any land had been taken away.",
      "\u201cWe will respond expeditiously to disinformation and mischaracterization of our laws as well as the general state of the country,\u201d Magwenya, Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe were obviously perturbed by the substance of the announcement (by Trump) because there were clearly inaccuracies.\u201d",
      "Magwenya said South Africa hoped to have more engagements with the Trump administration at various levels, including with \u201cinfluential figures like Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "The new law targets land that is unused or not being utilized in the public interest, and property rights are protected, according to the government. No land has been taken under the law, which was only signed by Ramaphosa two weeks ago and is a result of years of consultations and Parliamentary debates.",
      "It is designed to address some of the wrongs of South Africa\u2019s previous apartheid regime of white minority rule, where Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in designated areas for non-whites. The last land audit in South Africa estimated that whites \u2014 who make up 7% of the population of 62 million \u2014 own around 70% of land.",
      "In addition to the land law, Musk, who grew up in South Africa, has criticized its affirmative action policies and has falsely claimed that the killings of some white farmers amount to \u201cgenocide.\u201d The killings have been condemned but experts say they are part of South Africa\u2019s appallingly high levels of violent crime and are generally connected to farm robberies.",
      "Musk has put forward an overriding view that South African authorities are racist against their white citizens, but his stance has also become intertwined with his business interests. Musk accused South Africa on his social media site X this week of having \u201cracist ownership laws.\u201d",
      "While it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what he was referencing, it appeared to be the country\u2019s affirmative action laws that require part-Black ownership of some companies, also an attempt to rectify historic wrongs under apartheid, which ended in 1994. Musk left South Africa after completing high school in the late 1980s and moved to Canada.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn\u2019t meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "Ramaphosa held prior discussions with Musk over the possibility of him investing in South Africa, Magwenya said. \u201cHis (Musk\u2019s) particular issues were around Starlink, as well as the regulatory environment that regulates that sector.\u201d",

      "Rwandan-backed rebels are gaining ground in eastern Congo despite the unilateral ceasefire they declared earlier this week",
      "Goma, Congo -- Rwandan-backed rebels gained ground in eastern Congo on Wednesday despite the unilateral ceasefire they declared earlier this week, taking control of a city 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the provincial capital of Bukavu, civil society officials and residents told The Associated Press.",
      "The M23 rebels on Monday announced the ceasefire on humanitarian grounds after pleas for the safe passage of aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. But Congo's government has described the ceasefire as \u201cfalse communication,\" and the United Nations has noted reports of heavy fighting with Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region.",
      "N\u00e9n\u00e9 Bintou, president of the civil society of South Kivu province, told the AP that the mining city of Nyabibwe was under the control of the M23. The city is midway between Bukavu and Goma, the city the rebels seized last week and still control.",
      "\u201cThey have taken over the city of Nyabibwe since this morning from 9 a.m.,\" said Mo\u00efse Bisimwa, a resident reached by phone. \u201cSo we are here, we are worried about the situation. Apparently the ceasefire that was declared by the M23 is just smoke and mirrors.\u201d",
      "After seizing control of Goma, a provincial capital of 2 million people at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, the rebels were reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on Bukavu.",
      "The rebels on Monday said they did not intend to seize Bukavu or other areas, though they earlier expressed ambition to march on Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, a thousand miles away. \u201cHowever, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,\u201d M23 rebel spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said.",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. That\u2019s far more than in 2012, when they briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure. The M23 are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups active in Congo\u2019s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, asserted to CNN on Monday that he didn't know whether his military's forces are in Congo but said his country would do what's needed to protect itself.",
      "Experts and analysts have expressed concern that Rwanda aims to take control part of Congo to assure access to minerals. Rwanda's government, meanwhile, has framed the conflict as the defense of ethnic Tutsis in eastern Congo from ethnic Hutu forces linked to the genocide in Rwanda three decades ago that killed some 800,000 Tutsi, moderate Hutus and others.",
      "Rwandan forces have entered Congo in the past while asserting the same aim, helping to fuel what has become one of Africa's longest-simmering wars, with millions of Congolese displaced.",
      "Neighboring Uganda also has deployed soldiers inside Congo, with hundreds in Ituri province in the northeast since 2021 to fight the Allied Democratic Forces, another armed group, with the authorization of Congo's president. Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military, told the AP there had been no new deployments of soldiers to Congo in recent weeks.",
      "In Goma, where Congolese authorities have said over 2,000 have been killed since the city was seized, residents continued to bury bodies.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Congo, Bruno Lemarquis, has called for the urgent reopening of the airport in Goma, calling it \u201ca lifeline\u201d for the evacuation of wounded people and the delivery of aid.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump&rsquo;s proposal to forcibly transfer hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and develop faces some major obstacle",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to forcibly transfer hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and develop faces some major obstacle",
      "President Donald Trump's stunning proposal to forcibly transfer hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and develop it as a tourist destination faces major obstacles.",
      "The Palestinians and many others view such plans as ethnic cleansing, an attempt to drive them from their homeland after Israel's 15-month offensive against Hamas rendered much of it uninhabitable. It was also seen as an attempt to liquidate their decades-long struggle for a state, which has wide international support.",
      "Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan \u2014 close U.S. allies at peace with Israel \u2014 have condemned such plans and roundly rejected Trump's suggestion that they take in more Palestinian refugees.",
      "Saudi Arabia issued a rare overnight statement rejecting the idea of transfer and reiterating that it won't normalize relations with Israel \u2014 a key goal of the Trump administration \u2014 without the establishment of a Palestinian state including Gaza.",
      "The proposal also risks undermining the ceasefire in Gaza and the continued release of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Trump has claimed credit for brokering the truce, but its future is now more uncertain.",
      "Palestinians view Gaza as an integral part of their national homeland and aspire to an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Most of Gaza's population are descendants of refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out of what is now Israel. They were not allowed to return because they would have outnumbered the new state's Jewish population.",
      "The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, suggested that if Trump's goal is to send the Palestinians to a \u201chappy, nice place,\u201d they should return to their ancestral homes in Israel.",
      "The ideal of remaining on one's land despite threats of expulsion is at the heart of the Palestinians' struggle and self-identity, and was on vivid display last week when hundreds of thousands returned to northern Gaza despite its near-total destruction.",
      "Both Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which recognizes Israel and cooperates with it on security, have vehemently condemned Trump's proposal.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, have repeatedly rejected previous proposals to resettle Palestinians within their borders.",
      "They too fear that Israel would never allow the Palestinians to return, and that a mass influx of Palestinian refugees would once again destabilize the region, as it did in the decades after 1948, when it was a key factor in Lebanon's civil war and Israel's two invasions of that country. Both countries also have struggling economies that would have a hard time absorbing large numbers of refugees.",
      "Trump suggested that wealthy Gulf countries could pay to resettle the Palestinians, but that appears unlikely.",
      "Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting any transfer plans, and the Saudis repudiated the plan almost immediately.",
      "The Saudi statement reiterated remarks made in September by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who said Saudi Arabia would not normalize relations with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.",
      "The kingdom said its \u201cunwavering position is non-negotiable and not subject to compromises.\u201d",
      "Trump seems to relish using tariffs, sanctions and aid cutoffs to pressure allies and adversaries alike, and could apply economic pressure on countries like Egypt and Jordan, which have long relied on American aid.",
      "But those countries have levers of their own in the face of what they see as a major threat to their national security. And wealthy Gulf countries, which have also historically provided aid to Egypt and Jordan, could help cushion any economic blow.",
      "Egypt has already warned that any mass transfer of Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula bordering Gaza could undermine its peace treaty with Israel \u2014 a cornerstone of regional stability and American influence for nearly a half-century.",
      "Egypt and Qatar have also served as key mediators with Hamas in the talks that led to the ceasefire, and both are working with Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to try to extend it.",
      "The idea of mass transfer has historically been confined to the far-right in Israel, but on Wednesday, mainstream leaders said Trump's plan was worth considering.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the press conference with Trump, acknowledged that \u201cjaws drop\u201d when the U.S. president proposes unorthodox ideas, but then \u201cpeople scratch their heads and they say, \u2018You know, he\u2019s right.'\"",
      "Benny Gantz, a centrist politician and former general long seen as a more moderate alternative to Netanyahu, said Trump\u2019s proposal showed \u201ccreative, original and intriguing thinking,\u201d and should be studied alongside other war goals, \u201cprioritizing the return of all the hostages.\u201d",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid, a fierce critic of Netanyahu who has voiced support for a two-state solution in the past, did not object to the idea. Instead, he said in an interview with local media that it was too early to react to Trump\u2019s proposal since there are no concrete details, and that returning the hostages was most important.",
      "The current phase of the Gaza ceasefire, in which Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, ends in early March. The second phase, in which the remaining 60 or so hostages would be freed in exchange for more prisoners, is being negotiated.",
      "Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal \u2014 which would likely preclude any forcible transfer.",
      "Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who supports what he refers to as the \u201cvoluntary emigration\u201d of large numbers of Palestinians and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza, has threatened to leave Netanyahu's coalition if he doesn't resume the war after the first phase, which would likely lead to early elections. He welcomed Trump's proposal.",
      "The resumption of the war would put the remaining hostages' lives at risk, and there's no guarantee it would eliminate Hamas, which still controls most of Gaza. It would also undo what Trump has portrayed as a major accomplishment and further delay any normalization with Saudi Arabia.",
      "There's another possibility: That Trump's proposal is an opening gambit in a bargaining process aimed at eventually securing the kind of Middle East mega-deal he says he is seeking.",
      "It was only last week that Trump was threatening major tariffs against Canada and Mexico, America's two biggest trading partners, before putting them on hold after their leaders took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "During his first term, Trump flirted with the possibility of Israel annexing parts of the occupied West Bank before the idea was shelved as part of a normalization agreement with the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Trump could ultimately pare down his proposal or put it on hold in exchange for concessions from Arab leaders, perhaps on Gaza's reconstruction or on normalization with Israel \u2014 though the Saudi statement appeared to rule that out.",
      "There could be more clarity when the shock wears off, and when Trump meets with Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House next week.",

      "A 50-year-old West Africa regional bloc is facing significant challenges after three junta-led countries \u2014 Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso \u2014 formally left the group, known as ECOWAS",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- West Africa's regional bloc known as ECOWAS is facing significant challenges after three junta-led countries formally quit the group, forming their own alliance and weakening the bloc's standing and political authority.",
      "The withdrawal of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso from the bloc \u2014 now left with 12 member countries \u2014 was the culmination of a yearlong period of talks and diplomatic efforts aimed at trying to get them to reverse their decision, announced in January 2024.",
      "The departures were the first of its kind in the bloc's 50-year historys and analysts warn that a weaker ECOWAS could further undermine the increasingly fragile region.",
      "Widely seen as West Africa\u2019s leading political and regional authority, the 15-nation bloc was formed in 1975 to \u201cpromote economic integration\u201d among its member states. The bloc has also often collaborated with members to solve domestic challenges, from politics to economics and security.",
      "The bloc guarantees its members visa-free travel and access to a more than $700 billion market for a population of around 400 million people.",
      "However, in parts of West Africa, analysts say ECOWAS suffers from a legitimacy crisis, with citizens seeing it as representing only the interests of leaders and not theirs.",
      "Relations between ECOWAS and the coup-hit Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso began to deteriorate after the bloc imposed stringent sanctions on Niger to pressure its military to reverse the coup it had staged.",
      "The bloc has long used sanctions as a key tool in trying to reverse coups but those imposed on Niger were the harshest yet. Neighbors shut borders with the country, cut off more than 70% of Niger's electricity supply, suspended financial transactions and froze Niger's assets held by the bloc.",
      "The three countries called the sanctions \u201cinhumane\u201d and accused ECOWAS of \u201cmoving away from the ideals of its founding fathers and pan-Africanism.\u201d",
      "After leaving ECOWAS, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso created their own alliance known as the Alliance of Sahel States, or AES, named after the vast southern fringe of the Sahara Desert region.",
      "The three severed military ties with longstanding Western partners, including the United States and France, and turned to Russia for military support.",
      "ECOWAS has attempted to ease tensions with the AES, reversing last February the sanctions that the bloc had imposed and trying to revamp talks, which the AES rebuffed.",
      "Although ECOWAS has said it would leave the doors open for the three nations to continue to enjoy benefits as other bloc members do, the three junta-led countries are launching their own travel documents for their citizens.",
      "The bloc has also said that trade would continue as usual. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are still members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union \u2014 meaning trade and free movement of goods should continue among its eight-nation members. The monetary union includes the three junta-led countries as well as Senegal, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Togo and Benin.",
      "Officially, a six-month extension for talks between ECOWAS and the three countries expires in July, said Babacar Ndiaye, a political analyst at the West Africa-focused Wathi think tank. But there is little expectation that the AES countries would \"reconsider their withdrawal,\u201d Ndiaye said.",
      "There are concerns a weakened ECOWAS would be unable to handle security crises spreading from the conflict-battered Sahel to coastal West African nations.",
      "ECOWAS is also unlikely to be in a position to try and reverse the military takeovers in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. There will also likely be fewer investments in the three countries, which are among the region's poorest, said Charlie Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital."

      "The post office announced Tuesday that it would no longer accept parcels from the China and Hong Kong after the U.S. imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods and ended a customs exception that allowed small value parcels to enter the U.S. without paying tax.",
      "The Postal Service gave no reason for the reversal, but said it would work with Customs and Border Protection to implement a collection process for the new China tariffs to avoid delivery disruptions.",
      "The Postal Service did not immediately return a request for comment by the Requests for The Associated Press.",

      "Cheap, direct postal service helps these companies keep costs low, as did the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption that previously allowed shipments to go tax-free if their value is under $800.",

      "OREBRO, Sweden -- OREBRO, Sweden (AP) \u2014 Sweden's worst mass shooting left at least 11 people dead, including the gunman, and at least five seriously wounded at an adult education center west of Stockholm.",
      "The gunman's motive hadn't been determined by midday Wednesday as the Scandinavian nation \u2014 where gun violence at schools is very rare \u2014 reeled from an attack.",
      "\u201cNot in this place,\" Malin Hilmberg, 37, told The Associated Press as she stood near a growing makeshift memorial near the scene. \"I mean, we heard about it in different parts of the world, but of course it\u2019s a shock. It\u2019s your hometown and so many lives destroyed. It\u2019s hard to find words.\u201d",
      "Officials said Wednesday that three women and two men, all with gunshot wounds, underwent surgery at Orebro University Hospital. All were in serious but stable condition after being admitted to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Another woman was treated for minor injuries and was stable.",
      "Jonas Claesson, regional director of health and medical services, said that two of the gunshot victims were in intensive care Wednesday. All of the victims are over age 18, officials said. No other patients related to the shooting were admitted to Orebro University Hospital overnight.",
      "The school, called Campus Risbergska, offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults age 20 and older, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. The school is on the outskirts of Orebro, which is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Stockholm.",
      "Justice Minister Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer called the shooting \u201can event that shakes our entire society to its core.\u201d King Carl XVI Gustaf and Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the Royal Palace and government buildings. Mourners gathered near outside the school, comforting one another and dropping off candles and flowers to honor the victims.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very strange to be in the middle, where I live in Sweden, in Orebro, and this is all over the world,\" Emelia Fredriksson, 53, said. \"They\u2019re seeing us now and it\u2019s a very strange feeling.\u201d",

      "The shooting started Tuesday afternoon after many students had gone home following a national exam. Survivors scrambled for cover as the shots rang out, sheltering behind or under whatever they could find to escape the gunman and the gore. One woman with children feared she might never see them again, while another used her friend\u2019s shawl to staunch the bleeding of a man who\u2019d been shot in the shoulder.",
      "\u201cThose were the worst hours of my life. I did not know if I would get shot there and then, or in 10 minutes. You simply waited,\u201d Hellen Werme, 35, told the Expressen newspaper.",
      "Other students sheltered in nearby buildings, and other parts of the school were evacuated following the shooting.",
      "Authorities were working to identify the deceased. Police said that officers discovered the gunman dead at the school when they arrived. It was unclear how the gunman died.",
      "Roberto Eid Forest, head of the local police, said that the school\u2019s large premises meant it took a long time for officers to search the campus to ensure there were not any more victims. Police heard gunshots when they arrived and initially thought they were being fired upon, he said.",
      "Eid Forest said that six officers were treated for smoke inhalation. There wasn't a fire, he said, but authorities didn't immediately know what caused the smoke.",
      "Investigators will spend Wednesday seeking information from witnesses and checking any video footage of the attack.",
      "Police wouldn\u2019t say whether the shooter had multiple guns, nor would they say what kind of firearm was used in the shooting. While gun violence at schools is very rare in Sweden, people were wounded or killed with other weapons such as knives or axes in several incidents in recent years.",
      "In order to possess a firearm legally, applicants must obtain a weapon license and submit previously obtained hunting or target shooting certificates. Hunting certificates require people to pass a training course, while target shooters must be certified as active and experienced members of clubs.",
      "All weapons must be stored in secure cabinets approved by the police.",
      "There were no warnings beforehand, and police believe the perpetrator acted alone. Police haven't said if the man was a student at the school. They haven't released a possible motive, but authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point.",
      "Police raided the suspect\u2019s home after Tuesday\u2019s shooting, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what they found. Police cautioned the public against spreading incorrect narratives on social media.",
      "\u201cToday, we have witnessed brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people,\u201d the prime minister told reporters in Stockholm late Tuesday. \u201cThis is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. Many questions remain unanswered, and I cannot provide those answers either.",
      "\u201cBut the time will come when we will know what happened, how it could occur, and what motives may have been behind it. Let us not speculate,\u201d he said.",

      "About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the U.S. under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.",

      "UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.",
      "It said since Jan. 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.",
      "The Trump administration also announced the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program would be suspended from Jan. 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.",
      "Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from U.N. agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.",
      "Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.",

      "The EU\u2019s military mobility fund was part of an \u201cAction Plan\u201d pulled together in 2022 in the months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Money was earmarked for 95 projects in 21 countries to upgrade bridges, roads and railways for dual civilian and military use.",
      "But the fund amounted to just 1.7 billion euros ($1.8 billion), which Tony Murphy \u2013 -president of the European Court of Auditors \u2013 described as \u201cpeanuts\u201d compared to the 300 billion euros ($312 billion) that EU member countries were estimated to have spent on defense last year.",
      "Murphy said the action plan was drawn up hastily by the EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, and that it \u201cwas not built on sufficiently solid foundations.\u201d",
      "Unveiling the auditors\u2019 report, Murphy said the commission had acted \u201cwithout thoroughly assessing needs in advance. As a result, it was unable to estimate a budget commensurate with the objectives.\u201d He said the fund \u201cwas a fraction when compared to the overall needs.\u201d",
      "Most of the money meant to improve military mobility for the 2022-2026 period was quickly made available for projects and swallowed up within the first two years, draining the fund. The auditors suggested using EU civilian transport funds to help remove transport bottlenecks.",
      "Of the 95 projects given the green light, most were in countries close to the EU\u2019s borders with Russia, its ally Belarus and Ukraine. A southern transport corridor to Ukraine was all but ignored. Greece received no funds, while a project in Bulgaria received a small grant.",
      "\u201cWhat is particularly worrying, is that projects were selected in a piecemeal way,\u201d without any obvious strategy, Murphy said. Auditors were surprised to find that some projects were selected even before the commission and member countries had identified the most urgent priorities.",
      "Murphy also said that it was difficult for his auditors, but also for member countries, to work out who was in charge, as \u201cthere is no single point of contact at EU level for military mobility.\u201d",
      "In an email sent to reporters before the auditors\u2019 report was released, the commission defended itself by saying that when the EU was confronted with helping Ukraine defend itself the executive branch \u201cresponded quickly by accelerating and strongly frontloading\u201d spending on projects.",
      "It noted that military mobility is a priority of the new commission, which started work in December, and that a first-ever defense commissioner has been appointed. The commission pledged to address concerns about a \u201clack of coordination.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe consider the recommendations and conclusions of the European Court of Auditors as an opportunity to make a much-needed progress in the area of military mobility,\u201d the commission said."

      "While struggling with a third winter in the cold inside a shipping container-like temporary housing unit, the single father of three is grappling with a cost-of-living crisis that is affecting the whole country as well as still trying to heal the scars from the disaster.",
      "The magnitude 7.8 earthquake on Feb. 6, 2023, and a second powerful tremor that came hours later, destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings in 11 southern and southeastern Turkish provinces, leaving more than 53,000 people dead. Another 6,000 people were killed in the northern parts of neighboring Syria.",
      "It was one of Turkey\u2019s worst disasters.",
      "Aydin, a 51-year-old electrician who survived along with his elderly mother and his children, said sounds from the earthquake still echo in his mind.",
      "\u201cThe sounds of the homes crashing down, the sounds of the cries for help ... I still shake when they come to my mind,\u201d Aydin told The Associated Press over the phone.",
      "The house Aydin shared with his mother and children in the Mediterranean port city of Iskenderun \u2014 in the worst-hit province of Hatay \u2014 split into two, he said. The family were lucky to get out without injuries, he said, but ended up spending four days in the cold inside a makeshift tent he constructed with plastic sheets and pieces of wood.",
      "Aydin now lives in a container home at a temporary housing settlement called a \u201ccontainer city\u201d in Iskenderun but is struggling to make ends meet on a small state pension that he says barely covers anything.",
      "He occasionally finds work as an electrician but jobs in Iskenderun are scarce, he says.",
      "He is the sole provider for his family. His oldest son, who is 26, is receiving cancer treatment and needs to travel regularly to a hospital in the city of Adana, some 135 kilometers (84 miles) away, adding to the financial burden. His youngest child, a daughter, is at school while his middle son is also unemployed while waiting to start his military service.",
      "Life in the container city is a daily struggle, and sanitary conditions can be poor, he says.",
      "His family will qualify to receive one of the hundreds of thousands of government houses that are under construction, but Aydin is worried about furnishing it or paying the bills once they move in.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even own a pin, what will I do once I move in?\u201d he said.",
      "On Thursday, special prayers seeking blessings for the dead were recited from mosques, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Survivors visited cemeteries to pay respects to their loved ones, leaving carnations on their graves and offering their condolences to fellow visitors.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said recently that 45% of the earthquake housing had been completed by the end of 2024. The government was aiming to deliver a total of 452,983 homes, shops and other work spaces by the end of 2025.",
      "Jessie Thomson, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Turkey, said nearly half a million people remain in temporary container cities two years after the earthquake struck.",
      "\u201cHundreds of thousands continue to face immense challenges securing sustainable incomes, with depression and despair rising,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThe road to recovery is long and arduous, demanding continued support and solidarity.\u201d",
      "Aydin told the AP that when he rests his head on a pillow, he prays that he won\u2019t wake up to face another day.",
      "\u201cI swear, every day when I go to bed and put my head on the pillow, I pray to God to not wake me up in the morning,\u201d he said.",
      "Songul Erol, a 29-year-old mother of two girls aged 7 and 3, is slowly rebuilding her life in Samandag, another town in Hatay province, after spending months in tents and a container home.",
      "With the help of funds provided by the Turkish Red Crescent to small businesses, she was able to rent a shop and reopen her business selling bait, nets, knives or other gear used by fishermen and hunters. She has turned a room at the back of the shop into a living space for herself and her daughters, whose severe allergies were exacerbated by the conditions in the tents and the container home.",
      "Haunted by memory of buildings that tumbled in Samandag, she told the AP in a video call that she has only one dream: \u201cThat is to move to a one-story house that is not surrounded by apartment buildings.\u201d"

      "In a filing submitted to the agency this week, attorneys for Whole Foods Market argued the union involved with the election, held last week at a store in Philadelphia, interfered in the process by promising employees a 30% wage increase if they unionized and providing free transportation to them the day of the vote.",
      "The company also accused The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union \u2013 which worked to unionize workers through a local chapter \u2013 of intimidating employees who supported Whole Foods.

      "In a statement, UFCW Local 1776, the local union that pulled off the labor win, called the company\u2019s allegations baseless. It also said the objections filed by Whole Foods was a legal maneuvering done to delay the bargaining process.",

      "\u201cThis is physical disconnection from the last remaining element of our reliance on the Russian and Belarusian energy system,\u201d Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",

      "The three Baltic countries, which together share a 1,633-kilometer (1,015-mile) -long border with Russia and Belarus, officially informed Moscow and Minsk of the disconnection plan in July.

      "Next-door neighbors lost their near-identical homes in a California wildfire, but how they are navigating rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, a stark reflection of the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\u201cI chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\u201d said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they\u2019ll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\u201cIt changes the whole trajectory to your life,\u201d said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin\u2019s home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can\u2019t get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.\u2019\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \u201cdifficult but purposeful business decisions\u201d in California.",
      "Mercury didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson\u2019s case, and noted that it\u2019s difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn\u2019t cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\u201cBeing able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\u201d Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\u201cHalf the time, I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\u201cI could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It\u2019s just luck, really. It\u2019s nothing I did or didn\u2019t do,\u201d Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \u201cI had the same risk factors as everyone else.\u201d",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all trying to manage their exposure,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIf you think about wildfires, you don\u2019t want concentrated exposure.\u201d",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn\u2019t get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that\u2019s very, very painful,\u201d said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \u201cdone everything the insurers asked California to do\u201d but yielded little success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we\u2019re not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of risk in the system and there\u2019s a big question of who is going to pay for this,\u201d Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he\u2019ll have to take out loans to rebuild. He\u2019s considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can\u2019t fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he\u2019s thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cStuck paying for an insurance that doesn\u2019t cover anything. You don\u2019t want to live in a risky area. You don\u2019t have the safety net.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- It\u2019s one thing to fix your home after something basic has gone wrong, but it\u2019s a different beast to rebuild and recover after a major natural disaster has destroyed multiple properties on your street, in your neighborhood or across the region.",
      "Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re in crisis mode to figure out what to expect. It's important to understand your benefits and rights when it comes to home insurance in the event of a widespread emergency.",
      "Insurance is meant to cover what you lost, but that can mean two very different things.",
      "If you do nothing else, check your policy now to see if you have \u201creplacement cost value\u201d coverage. That\u2019s the comprehensive standard, which will grant you the amount of money needed to get a new replacement of what you lost in case of a major disaster like a wildfire.",
      "If you have \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, that means the dollar limits listed are only intended to cover the value of what you lost, which factors in depreciation at the time of the event.",
      "Amy Bach of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders says the two are apples and oranges in terms of payouts. She describes it this way: \u201cActual cash value is the Craigslist price. It\u2019s not the replacement cost price.\u201d",
      "From finding a new place to live to buying yourself clothes and toiletries, it\u2019s expensive to survive the immediate aftermath of an emergency, so get familiar with any state laws regulating insurance companies on advanced payments.",
      "For example, California, which has some of the strongest consumer protections in the nation, requires insurers to quickly pay out up to $250,000, or the equivalent of 30% of the policy\u2019s dwelling coverage limit, when a state of emergency has been declared and the home is known to be a total loss. This is considered an advanced payment, which doesn\u2019t require the homeowner to first itemize all their destroyed belongings or wait for an adjuster to access the site of the property.",
      "If you aren\u2019t able to connect with your insurer, look for emergency response centers in your community, which should provide state and federal troubleshooters to assist. They may also have information on what other aid, grants and subsidies are available to you in conjunction with or separate from your insurance benefits. Local businesses may also be there to offer freebies such as furniture or clothing.",
      "You will likely be displaced for months, or even years depending on how widespread the disaster was. For major wildfires, cleaning up the toxic burned site can take just as long as the entire new construction effort.",
      "And during that time, you must continue to pay the mortgage on a property you can't occupy.",
      "Property insurance generally refers to the cost of living while displaced as \u201closs of use\u201d coverage, which is also sometimes known as \u201cadditional living expense\u201d or \u201cfair rental value.\u201d",
      "Check this line item to ask yourself if you would have enough to get by paying for both your mortgage and a temporary rental."

    "story": [
      "Italy\u2019s justice minister has strongly defended the government\u2019s decision to free and repatriate a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court",
      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s justice minister strongly defended the government's decision to repatriate a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court, saying Wednesday that the court itself had made an \"immense mess\u201d of the case by issuing a contradictory and flawed arrest warrant.",
      "Justice Minister Carlo Nordio told the lower chamber of parliament that he was right to proceed carefully with the Jan. 18 warrant against Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, who is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "He said that The Hague-based court later \u201ccorrected, or rather completely overturned the previous warrant\u201d by changing the timespan of al-Masri\u2019s alleged crimes.",
      "\u201cThe court itself detected them and tried to change them five days later, because it realized that an immense mess was made,\u201d he told the Chamber of Deputies.",
      "The Italian government has been under fire from the ICC, human rights groups and opposition lawmakers ever since it freed al-Masri from prison on Jan. 21 and sent him back to Libya aboard an Italian military aircraft. Al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force.",
      "The ICC warrant available on the court's website accuses al-Masri of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Mitiga prison in Libya starting in 2015 that are punishable with life in prison. The ICC said he was accused of murder, torture, rape and sexual violence.",
      "Al-Masri was arrested in Turin on the ICC warrant on Jan. 19 at 9:30 a.m., the day after he arrived in the country from Germany to watch a soccer match. The Italian government has said Rome\u2019s court of appeals ordered him released Jan. 21 because of a technical problem in the way that the ICC warrant was transmitted, having initially bypassed the Italian justice ministry.",
      "Nordio repeated that argument Wednesday, saying that he only received an \u201cinformal email of a few lines\u201d from Interpol three hours after al-Masri was arrested.",
      "But he added that the text of the original Jan. 18 warrant itself was full of contradictions, specifically the timespan during which al-Masri allegedly committed his crimes. While the text of the warrant spoke of crimes allegedly occurring between 2015-2024, the conclusions referred to crimes allegedly committed from \u201c2011 onwards.\u201d",
      "\u201cAn irreconcilable contradiction emerges regarding an essential element of the arrestee\u2019s criminal conduct, regarding the time of the crime committed,\u201d Nordio said.",
      "When the court announced it was unsealing the warrant on Jan. 24, it said that it was issuing an updated warrant to \u201ccorrect certain typographical and clerical errors.\u201d The revised warrant speaks only of alleged crimes between 2015-2024.",
      "Human rights groups have blasted Italy\u2019s repatriation of al-Masri as a serious breach of its obligations as a founding member of the court. According to Article 89 of the Rome Statute, the 1998 treaty that gave birth to the ICC, member states must \u201ccomply with requests for arrest and surrender.\u201d",
      "And opposition lawmakers have seized on the case to attack Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni. They have demanded that Meloni herself brief parliament, and on Wednesday they held up signs saying \u201cMeloni the patriot at large\u201d in the chamber.",
      "Italy has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, on whom it relies to patrol its coasts and prevent migrants from leaving. Opposition politicians have accused the government of essentially caving to the threat that Libyan militias might have unleashed boatloads of migrants had al-Masri been handed over to the ICC.",
      "Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who also briefed Parliament on Wednesday, denied al-Masri was ever an interlocutor with the government on the migration issue. And he denied that Italy had received any threats in connection with his arrest.",
      "Opposition leader Elly Schlein of the Democratic Party blasted Nordio\u2019s presentation, saying that his legalistic arguments about the ICC warrant were misplaced and that he had no role to evaluate an arrest warrant from the court.",
      "\u201cMinister Nordio, you didn\u2019t speak to this chamber as a minister, but as the defense lawyer of a torturer,\u201d Schlein said.",
      "Nordio\u2019s attack on the ICC warrant is in line with the government\u2019s overall attempt to focus attention on the judiciary\u2019s role in the al-Masri saga.",
      "Last week, Rome\u2019s chief prosecutor informed Meloni, Nordio, Piatendosi and another government official that they were being investigated for allegedly favoring irregular migration by repatriating al-Masri. Meloni has spent days complaining about Italy's politicized judiciary, echoing a frequent line of attack taken by her onetime ally, the late former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.",
      "But Meloni has also acknowledged that national security issues came into play in the al-Masri case: In an X post on Jan. 29, Meloni framed the issue as a matter of defending Italy.",
      "\u201cWhen the security of the national and the interests of Italians are in play, there is no room for backing down,\u201d she wrote.",

    "story": [
      "The Hawaii Supreme Court is scheduled to hear about insurance issues tying up a potential $4 billion Maui wild fire settlement",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Thursday over insurance issues that are tying up a potential $4 billion settlement over Maui's catastrophic 2023 wildfire, the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century.",
      "The massive inferno decimated the historic town of Lahaina, killing more than 100 people, destroying thousands of properties and causing an estimated $5.5 billion in damage. Soon afterward, attorneys began lodging hundreds of lawsuits.",
      "A settlement was announced last summer, but insurance companies held out, insisting that they should have the right to go after the defendants separately to recoup money paid out to policyholders.",
      "Here are things to know about the settlement and the issues that could thwart the deal:",
      "A few days before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023, fire, Gov. Josh Green announced that seven defendants accused of causing the tragedy had agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve claims by thousands of people.",
      "Attorneys representing the individual plaintiffs agreed to the deal amid fears that main defendant Hawaiian Electric, the power company blamed for sparking the blaze, could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Other defendants include the state, Maui County and Kamehameha Schools, the largest private landowner in Hawaii.",
      "Victims' attorneys acknowledged that $4 billion wasn't enough to make up for what was lost but said the deal was worth accepting, given Hawaiian Electric's limited assets.",
      "Attorneys for the victims asked Judge Peter Cahill to bar insurance companies from going after the defendants separately to recoup money \u2014 a requirement that was key to the settlement. Cahill agreed, saying insurers could seek reimbursement only from the $4 billion pool the defendants have already agreed to pay.",
      "That didn't sit well with a group of about 200 property and casualty insurers that remain holdouts to the settlement. So far they have paid more than $2.3 billion to people and businesses and expect to pay $1 billion more. They want to be able to pursue their own claims against the defendants.",
      "Cahill has asked the state high court questions about subrogation, or how insurance companies can go about recouping money.",
      "Among the issues before the court is whether state laws controlling health care insurance reimbursement also apply to casualty and property insurance in limiting companies' ability to pursue independent legal action against those held liable.",
      "It's not clear when the justices will issue a ruling.",
      "A last-minute deal between victims' lawyers last week averted a separate trial over how to split the $4 billion between individual plaintiffs and others covered by a class-action lawsuit. Some victims had been ready to take the witness stand, while others submitted pre-recorded testimony describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "Common in the insurance industry, subrogation is a legal process that allows an insurance company to pursue a party that caused a covered loss. It's one way companies recover the amount of claims paid to policyholders.",
      "Insurance companies say subrogation is a way to offset costs associated with a catastrophic event so premiums won\u2019t have to go up. The process isn't for natural disasters such as hurricanes, but for when there is someone at fault.",
      "Hawaii's governor has previously denounced subrogation.",
      "When insurance companies collect huge profits and no disasters occur, they don't send refunds back to policyholders, Green noted in comments quoted in court filings. But when a tragedy does happen, they look to recoup their payments to the victims.",
      "\"It\u2019s fundamentally unfair, and they call it subrogation,\u201d he said.",
      "The insurance industry has been unfairly villainized as outsiders taking resources from the community while those responsible for the fires won\u2019t be held accountable, Vincent Raboteau, an attorney representing the insurers, told Cahill during a hearing last year.",
      "Insurance lawyers have said they want to hold the defendants accountable and aren\u2019t trying to get in the way of fire victims getting settlement money.",
      "Origin and cause investigations are \u201ctime-intensive and costly,\" lawyers said in a court brief of insurers who \u201cassume the burden of these investigations,\u201d and take on the risk of those costs.",
      "Insurers promptly paid claims, which are helping victims rebuild, the brief said: \u201cFor many wildfire victims, payment of claims by their insurer provided quick access to desperately needed funds.\u201d",
      "Not for a while.",
      "If the state Supreme Court agrees that an insurance company can sue defendants directly, \u201cthat would likely destroy the global settlement agreement,\u201d said Jacob Lowenthal, an attorney representing individual plaintiffs. The plaintiffs would go back to Cahill's courtroom to figure out trial dates for their lawsuits.",
      "If the justices rule the other way, the settlement could head toward finalization, putting in motion an administrative process for doling out money.",
      "It's possible that whichever side loses will seek review at the U.S. Supreme Court."

      "Ford also announced its fourth-quarter financial results, which topped Wall Street's estimates. Still, the outlook appeared to spook investors, which sent shares in the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker down 5.1% in after-hours trading. The stock closed 1.5% lower during regular trading."

    "summary": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Donald Trump's \u201cinfluential\u201d billionaire adviser Elon Musk a day after the new U.S. president promised to cut funding for South Africa over a land expropriation law, Ramaphosa's spokesperson said Wednesday.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s conversation with Musk was \u201clogical,\u201d spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said, because the South African-born Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur has held previous investment-related discussions with Ramaphosa and is a Trump ally.",
      "The land law, which was signed by Ramaphosa last month, is contentious because it gives the government scope to expropriate land from private parties.",
      "Trump announced Sunday that he would stop financial assistance while the U.S. investigated why South Africa was \u201cconfiscating land\u201d from some people, without saying who. He told reporters wrongly that the South African government was taking away land and \u201cactually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d Trump again didn\u2019t provide details.",
      "The South African government said Trump\u2019s announcement and related criticism of the country by Musk was full of \u201cmisinformation and distortions\u201d and the call to Musk was to set the record straight.",
      "Musk, who is leading the Trump administration\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, has long criticized the government in his homeland, a key U.S. trading partner in Africa, as being anti-white and has cast the law in question as a deliberate act to take land away from its white minority.",
      "He faces scrutiny in the U.S. for his control over parts of the federal government, but the South Africa issue also shows his influence on U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Should Trump follow through on his promise to cut South Africa\u2019s funding, it would stop nearly half a billion dollars a year in assistance, the vast majority of it for the world\u2019s biggest HIV/AIDS program.",
      "South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world at more than 8 million, with around 5.5 million on antiretroviral medication. The U.S. funds around 17% of South Africa's HIV program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, and gave the country $440 million in assistance last year.",
      "The South African government said no land has been confiscated, and even groups in South Africa that have been critical of the new law said Trump was wrong in claiming any land had been taken away.",
      "\u201cWe will respond expeditiously to disinformation and mischaracterization of our laws as well as the general state of the country,\u201d Magwenya, Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe were obviously perturbed by the substance of the announcement (by Trump) because there were clearly inaccuracies.\u201d",
      "Magwenya said South Africa hoped to have more engagements with the Trump administration at various levels, including with \u201cinfluential figures like Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "The new law targets land that is unused or not being utilized in the public interest, and property rights are protected, according to the government. No land has been taken under the law, which was only signed by Ramaphosa two weeks ago and is a result of years of consultations and Parliamentary debates.",
      "It is designed to address some of the wrongs of South Africa\u2019s previous apartheid regime of white minority rule, where Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in designated areas for non-whites. The last land audit in South Africa estimated that whites \u2014 who make up 7% of the population of 62 million \u2014 own around 70% of land.",
      "In addition to the land law, Musk, who grew up in South Africa, has criticized its affirmative action policies and has falsely claimed that the killings of some white farmers amount to \u201cgenocide.\u201d The killings have been condemned but experts say they are part of South Africa\u2019s appallingly high levels of violent crime and are generally connected to farm robberies.",
      "Musk has put forward an overriding view that South African authorities are racist against their white citizens, but his stance has also become intertwined with his business interests. Musk accused South Africa on his social media site X this week of having \u201cracist ownership laws.\u201d",
      "While it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what he was referencing, it appeared to be the country\u2019s affirmative action laws that require part-Black ownership of some companies, also an attempt to rectify historic wrongs under apartheid, which ended in 1994. Musk left South Africa after completing high school in the late 1980s and moved to Canada.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn\u2019t meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "Ramaphosa held prior discussions with Musk over the possibility of him investing in South Africa, Magwenya said. \u201cHis (Musk\u2019s) particular issues were around Starlink, as well as the regulatory environment that regulates that sector.\u201d",

      "A new coalition of nonprofits came together overnight to challenge a seemingly sweeping order from the Trump administration last week pausing trillions of dollars in federal funding",
      "NEW YORK -- A new coalition of nonprofits came together overnight to challenge a seemingly sweeping order from the Trump administration last week pausing trillions of dollars in federal funding. They succeeded in blocking that order, at least for now.",
      "It's the start of what nonprofits expect will be a deluge of court actions, as civil litigation promises to be a powerful tool civil society groups plan to use to push back on President Donald Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cThere will be an avalanche of litigation to stop unlawful activity,\u201d said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which brought the nonprofit coalition\u2019s suit against the federal funding freeze. A judge ruled Monday to allow their lawsuit, one of many filed in the first weeks of the new administration, to move forward and extended a temporary restraining order.",
      "More than a dozen federal lawsuits have already been filed against President Trump and his administration by a wide range of nonprofits, from several Quaker organizations to the consumer rights group Public Citizen to New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support.",
      "Many considered policy changes under the new administration, but few contemplated the total suspension of foreign aid or a widespread pause of federal funding. The federal funding freeze was a moment widely viewed by the nonprofit sector as an existential crisis. And organizations took a range of approaches from keeping their heads down, to organizing community forums, to firing up supporters to contact Congress.",
      "Diane Yentel, the president and CEO the National Council of Nonprofits, moved quickly to take action. She had already been tracking the impact of President Donald Trump's initial executive orders on nonprofits when she saw the memo in the evening on Jan. 27.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget order said: \u201cFederal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.\u201d",
      "Posting to LinkedIn that night, Yentel wrote, the OMB memo was, \u201ca potential 5-alarm fire for nonprofits and the people and communities they serve,\u201d adding, \u201cWe won\u2019t stand by and let it happen.\u201d",
      "Within hours, the National Council of Nonprofits, Democracy Forward, and several other groups joined forces and hammered out a legal strategy.",
      "\u201cWe worked throughout the night to pull it all together and be able by 9 a.m. for the attorneys to call the judge in the district court and let them know that there would be a challenge to this order and that we would need to have an emergency hearing that day,\u201d Yentel said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Tom Watson, president and founder of philanthropic consulting firm CauseWired, was pleased to see the collective action led by the National Council of Nonprofits, along with several other groups including the American Public Health Association, Main Street Alliance, which supports small businesses, and SAGE, which serves LGBTQ+ adults.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a short thunderstorm that we can just ride out and then, everything will be back to normal,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of a massive tidal wave,\u201d that threatens to sweep away the whole ecosystem.",
      "Nonprofits and their funders can draw on experiences from the first Trump administration and the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 which created similar upheaval. But many see the federal funding freeze as unprecedented.",
      "Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said access to some of the platforms where nonprofit organizations receive funding was cut off even before the deadline the Trump administration set in its memo, increasing the sense of confusion and panic.",
      "Her organization called on people to contact their representatives in Congress to provide them information about the consequences of this potential funding freeze. At least 10,000 people used their electronic contact form to reach members of Congress, NAEH reported last week.",
      "Grace Bonilla, president of The United Way of New York City, which receives state and local government funding to support food pantries at hundreds of small organizations in New York City, said those organizations are already impacted not just by concerns about funding freezes, but by the administration's other policies, like increased immigration enforcement, for example.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s week three,\u201d she said, referring to the start of the Trump administration. Bonilla said she's been constantly talking with other nonprofit leaders, funders and corporations about how they should respond. For now, many are just waiting to see what happens next, she said.",
      "\u201cPeople are painfully aware about what this means, not just to their bottom line budget, but what it means in the cost of people, the number of people that are going to be hurt by any of these things actually coming to fruition,\" she said.",
      "Bonilla said it\u2019s hard for leaders of nonprofits and others in the private sector to say, \u201cThis is the thing that we\u2019re going to stand behind,\u201d because they don\u2019t know what will come next.",
      "\"I would say that our elected officials need to be braver,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have left many cities along Mexico's northern border in limbo",
      "CIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico -- As soon as the sun glints over miles of border fence dividing the United States and Mexico, the engines of cargo trucks packed with auto and computer parts roar to life along border bridges and bleary-eyed workers file into factories to assemble a multitude of products geared toward the U.S. market.",
      "For more than half a century, this daily rhythm has helped fuel the heartbeat of a transnational machine that generated more than $800 billion in trade between the U.S. and Mexico in 2024 alone.",
      "Over the past year, however, President Donald Trump's threatened 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada have plunged manufacturing hubs all along the northern Mexican border into limbo, a state that persists despite a one-month reprieve to which Trump agreed on Monday.",
      "Tariffs would cripple Mexican border economies that are reliant on factories churning out products for the U.S. \u2014 auto parts, medical supplies, computer components, myriad electronics \u2014  and likely thrust the country into a recession, economic forecasters have warned. Some workers wonder how much longer they'll have jobs, while business leaders say the uncertainty has already led many investors to start tightening their purse strings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a conflict between governments and we\u2019re the ones most affected,\u201d said 58-year-old truck driver Carlos Ponce, leaning against his rig at the customs border crossing between Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, Texas. \u201cTomorrow, who knows what will happen?\u201d",
      "Ponce, who was driving a truck full of car shock absorbers, said he's spent the past 35 years moving goods across the border, just as his father did before him. Now, he's unsure how much longer that will last.",
      "Manufacturing in export-oriented assembly plants known as maquiladoras are the heart of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez's economy, with 97% of its goods going to the U.S., according to figures from Mexico's Economic Ministry.",
      "The factories were born in the 1960s in an attempt to boost economic development in northern Mexico and lower prices for U.S. consumers. The maquiladora program later took off after the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was signed in 1994. The agreement was supplanted by a similar pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, negotiated between the three countries during Trump's first term.",
      "Today, neon signs with the dollar-to-peso exchange rate flash across the city, a reminder of the close ties binding both sides of the border.",
      "\u201cEverything that happens in the United States: its economic, social policy \u2026 directly affects us because companies here in Mexico depend on what they sell in the United States,\u201d said Thor Salayandia, head of his family's auto-parts manufacturing facility in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. \"The United States also needs Mexico to keep manufacturing, but they\u2019re not seeing things like that.\u201d",
      "This week, workers and business leaders alike breathed a sigh of relief when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she had negotiated with Trump to delay tariffs one month.",
      "\u201cNow, we're buying time,\u201d Salayandia said.",
      "Workers here assemble everything from auto parts to computer panels to T-shirts emblazoned with the American flag, logos of popular U.S. football teams and slogans such as \u201cProud to be a federal employee.\u201d",
      "Parts can cross the border multiple times before the final product is sold to U.S. consumers. That economic interdependence has left many in the city struggling to imagine a future without it. One U.S. company said it would likely have to move part of its manufacturing in the city to the U.S., but at a sharp cost.",
      "Antonio Ruiz, a compliance officer at Tecma, a U.S. firm that helps foreign companies set up shop along the border, said his was among a number of businesses to call emergency meetings over the weekend as economic forecasters warned that the tariffs could drive Mexico into a recession.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be prepared for something that has never happened before,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cAs much as you want to prepare for it, the best you can do is prepare to brace yourself in the short term.\u201d",
      "Salayandia and economists warn that any sort of tax could lead to cascading unemployment and rising prices on both sides of the border. In Mexico, they say, it could also spur a rise in violence in border areas by pushing the unemployed into the hands of drug cartels, as well as an increase in Mexican migration to the U.S.",
      "Manuel Sotelo, a leader of Mexico\u2019s National Chamber of Freight Transportation who owns a fleet of trucks that cross the border every day, sees the tariff threats as more of a political power move than a future economic reality.",
      "\"Both countries would be paralyzed,\" said Sotelo, who sat at a desk covered with local newspapers carrying bold headlines on the tariffs, a Trump bobblehead positioned behind him. \u201cLet's say he did slap a 25% tariff (on Mexico), what would they do during the Super Bowl without avocados?\u201d",
      "On the other hand, Sotelo acknowledges that the tariff talk has already inflicted some damage. He and other business leaders say that over the past year they've watched investment dip in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez because of political uncertainty, as investors hesitate to funnel their money into businesses that could collapse with the stroke of a pen in Washington.",
      "While Trump's election has been the primary driver of that uncertainty, June elections in Mexico and a controversial judicial reform carried out by Mexico's governing party have added to it. Sotelo said he saw a 7% drop in business last year, and only expects that to continue until lingering tariff threats are resolved.",
      "One collective of maquiladoras in the city says it has seen at least three factories halt production.",
      "\u201cEvery time we hear this discourse from political leaders, the people running our governments, it sends shock waves through the border,\u201d Salayandia said. \"Because the border is a global thermometer. Our products go all over the world. Those companies will go look in other parts of the world where they offer conditions to keep competing.\u201d",

      "The nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis is in the spotlight as Californians begin the long road to rebuilding after the deadly Eaton and Palisades wildfires.",
      "For neighbors Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson, the difference in insurance coverage on their nearly identical homes in Altadena reveals how unequal that recovery will be.",
      "Hamlin was privately insured and has already been paid out nearly a million dollars. She is searching for contractors to rebuild her house.",
      "Wilson will receive a fraction of what he needs because he was covered by the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program known as the FAIR Plan. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "The plan is a temporary coverage option created by the state as a last resort for homeowners who can't find private insurance. More Californians are relying on it than ever after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in recent years.",
      "In Wilson\u2019s case, his private insurer declined to renew his policy last year although he offered to install various fire mitigation efforts. No other insurers were willing to write him a new policy, forcing Wilson to get on the FAIR Plan to satisfy his mortgage requirements.",
      "The number of FAIR residential policies issued in the state more than doubled between 2020 and 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies.",
      "Under the FAIR Plan, Wilson paid about 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, though he is slated to receive less than half the coverage. And his true home insurance cost was actually much higher because he also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects.",
      "The Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurers, said the FAIR Plan provides a lifeline for homeowners who cannot find private insurance, and that outcomes would be far worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "State officials have rolled out several new regulations to give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.",
      "Governments also have to shoulder the costs for serious mitigation efforts, or the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, said Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley. California is proposing to direct roughly $25 million from a voter-approved climate bond to bolster fire mitigation requirements around homes.",

      "A renewed attempt to auction off the family home of Myanmar\u2019s imprisoned former leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been unsuccessful as the property in a country embroiled in a civil war failed to attract any bidders",
      "YANGON, Myanmar -- A renewed attempt to auction off the family home of Myanmar\u2019s imprisoned former leader Aung San Suu Kyi was unsuccessful Wednesday as the prospect of paying tens of millions of dollars for a property in a country embroiled in a civil war failed to attract any bidders.",
      "It was the third attempt to sell the lakeside property where Suu Kyi had been held under house arrest for nearly 15 years. It's widely viewed as a historical landmark of her nonviolent struggle against military rule for which she won the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "In the previous attempt at auction last August, the court-ordered asking price was $142 million; on Wednesday it was reduced by $1 million, to $141 million.",
      "Suu Kyi's democratically elected government was ousted by the military in February 2021. She is now serving a combined 27-year sentence after being convicted of a string of criminal charges that supporters say have been fabricated to discredit her.",
      "Since then, resistance to the military government has grown and the country is now in the midst of a brutal civil war.",
      "The court-ordered auction followed a bitter decades-long legal dispute between Suu Kyi and her brother, Aung San Oo, who has sought an equal division of the property.",
      "Each time the house has gone up for auction its price has been reduced, but there has yet to be a bidder.",
      "In March, the asking price was 315 billion kyats, about $150 million at official rates, and the second was in August with 300 billion kyats, more than $142 million.",
      "On Wednesday, the opening asking price for the 1.9-acre (0.78-hectare) lakeside property in Yangon was set at 297 billion kyats. That's about $141 million at official rates, or about $66 million at black-market rates, which better reflect the real value of the kyat.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s auction was held in front of the closed gates of the property, which has served as an unofficial party headquarters and a political shrine for the country\u2019s pro-democracy movement.",
      "While living there, Suu Kyi hosted visiting dignitaries including U.S. President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.",
      "Like the previous auctions, it took less than a minute for a district court official to emerge and announce there had been no bidders and end the proceedings.",
      "\u201cThe auction is unsuccessful as there is no bidder,\u201d the official, who did not identify herself, announced outside the gate.",
      "The two-story colonial-style building on Inye Lake in Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, was given decades ago by the government to Suu Kyi\u2019s mother, Khin Kyi, after her husband, independence hero Gen. Aung San, was assassinated in July 1947.",
      "Suu Kyi, 79, remained there after her 2010 release from house arrest until moving in 2012 to the capital, Naypyitaw, to serve in parliament. She became the nation\u2019s leader after a 2015 general election.",
      "According to legal procedures, the court will continue to handle the auction process, but the details are not yet known."

      "IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until May 15th, according to a letter sent Wednesday to all IRS employees",
      "WASHINGTON -- IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until May 15th, according to a letter sent Wednesday to IRS employees.",
      "The letter says that \u201ccritical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\u201d from the administration's buyout plan until May 15, 2025.",
      "The news comes after President Donald Trump announced a plan to offer buyouts to federal employees through a \u201cdeferred resignation program\u201d to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline is Feb. 6.",
      "The buyouts, sent to roughly 2.3 million workers, are for all full-time federal employees with some exemptions, including military personnel, employees of the U.S. Postal Service and positions related to immigration enforcement. They would get about eight months of salary if they accept.",
      "The federal government employed more than 3 million people as of November, accounting for nearly 1.9% of the nation\u2019s entire civilian workforce, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Union leaders that represent workers across the federal government have criticized the proposal. Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, has advised all federal workers not to accept the offer, which she says is dubious.",
      "\u201cThis is not a good deal for them,\u201d Greenwald told The Associated Press. \u201cIf you sign this document and then later change your mind, you are left without any power to fight back.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI do not recommend people sign the document. They need to have control of their own career, and this document does not give it to them.\u201d",
      "The NTEU union represents roughly 150,000 employees in 37 departments and agencies.",
      "\u201cThis country needs skilled, experienced federal employees. And so we are urging people not to take this deal because it will damage the services to the American people and it will harm the federal employees who have dedicated themselves and their career to serving.\u201d",
      "Jan. 27 is the official start date of the 2025 tax season and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline.",
      "\u201cWhat most people don\u2019t realize is that 85% of the federal workforce works outside of D.C.,\u201d she said. \"They\u2019re your neighbors, your family, your friends. And they deliver key services for the American people.\""

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 06:58:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Edmunds compares certified pre-owned vehicles and standard used cars, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each",
    "story": [
      "Edmunds compares certified pre-owned vehicles and standard used cars, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each",
      "When shopping for a used car, many buyers struggle to know if paying extra for a certified pre-owned one is worth it. Buying a certified pre-owned vehicle, commonly called a CPO vehicle, has benefits and drawbacks. Understanding the differences can help you make an informed choice that aligns with your budget, priorities and desire for peace of mind. Here Edmunds editors take an in-depth look at the benefits, limitations and considerations for each.",
      "Certified pre-owned vehicles are used vehicles that have been inspected and refurbished by a dealership to meet specific quality standards determined by the manufacturer. They typically come with a manufacturer-backed warranty, roadside assistance and other perks.",
      "One of the primary benefits of a certified pre-owned vehicle is the assurance of quality. These cars undergo an inspection process \u2014 often encompassing 100 to 200 points \u2014 to ensure they meet safety, performance and cosmetic standards. Any necessary repairs or replacements are completed before the vehicle is put up for sale. Buyers also benefit from additional protections, such as extended manufacturer warranties that often cover major components and systems beyond the original factory warranty.",
      "Another advantage is that certified pre-owned vehicles may come with added perks, such as complimentary maintenance, roadside assistance, and sometimes even exchange or return policies. These benefits can provide significant peace of mind for buyers who want reliability at a lower cost than a new car.",
      "However, these advantages come at a price. Certified pre-owned vehicles are typically more expensive than non-certified used cars. This premium can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the make, model and dealership.",
      "Most used vehicles are sold as-is, without any manufacturer-backed certification or guarantees. While they don\u2019t come with the same assurances as certified pre-owned vehicles, they do typically cost less.",
      "Affordability is the biggest draw of buying a regular used car. This upside makes a standard used vehicle an attractive option for those looking to save money up front. However, purchasing a standard used car carries more risk because it\u2019s harder to know the vehicle\u2019s true condition. While some dealerships may offer limited warranties, these are usually less comprehensive than the coverage provided with certified pre-owned vehicles.",
      "Budget should be your first consideration in this decision. If you have the financial flexibility to pay more for a certified pre-owned vehicle, it may be worth the investment.",
      "Next, think about your risk tolerance and maintenance preferences. If peace of mind is a top priority, the thorough inspection and warranty coverage of a certified pre-owned vehicle can provide significant value. But if you\u2019re comfortable conducting your own due diligence and gambling a bit on future repair costs, a standard used car might be the better choice.",
      "The vehicle\u2019s age and mileage are also important considerations. Certified pre-owned programs typically have strict requirements for these factors, so you\u2019ll likely find newer models with lower mileage. This also means that you\u2019ll find a better selection when shopping for non-certified used cars.",
      "Finally, be sure to research the dealership and manufacturer\u2019s certification program. Not all CPO programs are created equal; some offer more comprehensive inspections and better warranties than others. Similarly, when buying a standard used vehicle, seek out a reputable dealership. Paying for your own inspection is a good idea with any standard used vehicle. Expect to spend $200 to $300.",
      "Buying a certified pre-owned vehicle doesn\u2019t guarantee a trouble-free ownership experience. Problems can still arise, although they\u2019re less likely than with a non-certified used car.",
      "Standard used vehicles also have their drawbacks, chiefly the lack of warranty and inspection guarantees. Also, be aware of the look-alike certified warranty. These are warranties offered by the dealership selling the vehicle, which rarely meet the same standards as a manufacturer CPO warranty. For example, the vehicle will likely only be eligible for warranty repairs at that dealership, while many CPO programs let you take your car to any certified dealership.",
      "Whether you\u2019re buying a Certified pre-owned or regular used vehicle, be certain to read the fine print that determines the terms of your purchase or your warranty coverage. A few examples: Some standard used vehicles may come with a return or exchange policy that can add comfort to the transaction. And sometimes redeeming all your benefits under a CPO program must be done within a certain time window, which limits its value.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 02:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday even though inflation remains above its target",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday even though inflation remains above its target",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday, even though inflation remains above its target.",
      "Most economists think the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will lower the bank's main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, taking it to its lowest level since mid-2023. The base rate helps dictate how expensive it is for individuals to take out a mortgage or a loan, while also influencing the returns offered by banks on savings.",
      "Of particular interest to financial markets is what the bank's accompanying economic forecasts show and the tone of Gov. Andrew Bailey in his ensuing press briefing.",
      "\u201cUntil now, the bank has cut at alternate meetings, but a stagnating economy and declining employment argue for more urgent action,\u201d said Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "The rate-setting panel is tasked with ensuring that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, hits a 2% target over the coming couple years or so.",
      "Though inflation is standing at 2.5% and expected to rise in coming months, partly as a result of business tax increases from the new Labour government, most economists think it will then trend lower towards the target, hence the panel's ability to cut.",
      "Official figures earlier this month showed a surprise decline in the inflation rate to 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy.",
      "Another potential reason for rate-setters to cut borrowing rates is that economic growth in the U.K. has stagnated, which will likely put downward pressure on inflation.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic."

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump says he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a massive human rights violation",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump said he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a human rights violation, a move that reflects Elon Musk's repeated and false claims over the years that authorities in his country of birth are anti-white and even encouraging the killing of white people.",
      "Trump said on Sunday that \u201cterrible things are happening in South Africa. The leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things\u201d without providing specifics. He said \u201cthey're taking away land, they're confiscating land, and actually they're doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "While it wasn't clear exactly what Trump was referring to, he appeared to be referencing a new law in South Africa that gives the government powers in some instances to expropriate land from people.",
      "Musk, a close Trump ally and head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has highlighted that law in recent social media posts and cast it as a threat to South Africa's white minority.",
      "Many South Africans viewed Trump's sudden pledge to punish America's biggest trade partner in Africa as surprising and at least partly influenced by billionaire Tesla owner Musk, who was born in the South African capital of Pretoria but left for Canada after he completed high school.",
      "The Expropriation Act was signed into law by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month and allows the government to take land in specific instances where it is not being used, or where it would be in the public interest if it is redistributed.",
      "It aims to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era, when Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in areas designated for non-whites.",
      "Ramaphosa responded to Trump's comments Monday by saying the U.S. president was wrong and no land had been confiscated, and said he looked forward to \"engaging\" with the Trump administration over the issue. The South African government said that the U.S. didn't understand the law.",
      "Musk accused Ramaphosa's government in 2023 of allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d to happen over the killings of some white farmers, which have happened for years.",
      "While the killings have been condemned, experts have said there is no evidence of any genocide and they are part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates and mostly related to farm robberies. Crime affects all South Africans, and the country has an average of 70 homicides a day, with the vast majority of the victims Black.",
      "Musk also waded into the issue Monday by replying to a post by Ramaphosa's official account on X with the question: \u201cWhy do you have openly racist ownership laws?\u201d",
      "Again, it remains unclear exactly what Musk was referring to, but his comments seemed to allude to South Africa's affirmative action laws in business that are designed to advance opportunities for Blacks and other racial groups who were disadvantaged under apartheid. Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn't meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "More than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule, white people in South Africa generally still have a much higher standard of living than Black people.",
      "That's reflected in poverty statistics, with a 2021 study by the South African Human Rights Commission finding that 64% of Black people were living in poverty against 1% of white people. When it comes to land, white people make up about 7% of the population of 62 million and own around 70% of land, according to the most recent land audit, although that share has decreased since apartheid.",
      "Still, the new land law has drawn criticism even from inside the country, with civic groups that represent the interests of whites and some South African political parties saying they will challenge it in court because it allows land to be taken without compensation in some cases.",
      "While South Africa has deep socioeconomic problems and a damaging legacy from nearly a half-century of apartheid, it is regarded as a stable democracy and is not a country brimming with racial tensions as it is sometimes portrayed to be.",
      "Trump said on his Truth Social platform that South Africa was \u201ctreating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\u201d again without elaborating, and he would stop all future funding while the U.S. investigated.",
      "That threatens around $400 million a year in aid the U.S. gives to South Africa, most of it for the country's HIV/AIDS program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR. South Africa's U.S. funding through PEPFAR was already threatened by Trump's global aid freeze.",
      "South Africa was also concerned that Trump might remove it from the AGOA trade agreement, which gives South Africa and other African nations tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Trump has already imposed tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico \u2014 although on Monday he said he is pausing his tariffs planned for Mexico by one month.",

      "NEW YORK -- For Elon Musk fans, it\u2019s the half a trillion-dollar bet.",
      "That is how much the stock market value of Tesla has rocketed since the presidential election, a vertiginous climb uninterrupted in recent days despite a disappointing financial report that would have sunk the stock of nearly any other company.",
      "Investors are wagering that President Donald Trump will help Musk\u2019s company more than hurt it with his plans to take an axe to reams of Washington regulations and wield tariffs to get his way with key trading partners.",
      "Less regulation? Fantastic. Trade war? No biggie.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a golden age for Tesla and Musk,\u201d said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives, adding after an investor conference call Wednesday, \u201cThis is the bullish I\u2019ve ever heard Musk.\u201d",
      "Investing in Tesla has long been a gamble. Odds were against Musk creating a successful electric car company, never mind growing it to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker \u2013 and in the process making himself the world\u2019s richest man. But this latest bet seems particularly risky.",
      "Musk says the true value of company lays in a future of Tesla robots, thousands of them possibly by the end of the year, and in unsupervised, driverless vehicles. He promised in Tesla's investor conference call to start offering such robotaxis in June in Austin, Texas, and across the country by the end of next year.",
      "Speeding all that along will be Trump, or so the story goes, who has given Musk an office in the White House and made him the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency tasked with shrinking the size of the government.",
      "Trump\u2019s new transportation secretary, who can have a big impact on Tesla, is mostly sticking to the script. Sean Duffy has promised to cut excessive regulation on automakers as well as to come up with a single set of federal rules on self-driving technology to replace a patchwork of state-by-state ones that Musk has blasted for holding back development.",
      "Perhaps more importantly, Trump has softened his stance toward China, a big market for Tesla, hitting the country with an additional 10% tariffs starting Saturday, and not the 60% he threatened on the campaign trail. Still, Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as China, should affect Tesla. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said last week the company should feel an impact to its business because it sources parts from around the globe.",
      "Trump has also vowed to do other things that will hurt Musk\u2019s business.",
      "Tesla sources many of its parts from abroad and so Trump\u2019s decision to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will hit the company hard if they stick.",
      "Trump also has vowed to eliminate a $7,500 federal tax rebate designed to get people to buy electric vehicles. He\u2019ll also lower emission standards, a potential blow to Tesla\u2019s business of selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to car makers that pollute more and fall short of the requirements. Tesla sold $692 million of these credits i n the last three months of 2024, a 60% jump from a year ago, revenue that nearly all flows straight to Tesla\u2019s bottom line.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether the Trump administration will hold off on investigations into Tesla, in particular a technology the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles could require human intervention at any moment. In October, the transportation department\u2019s auto safety regulator, the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration, launched the latest of several probes into the technology after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "Transportation Secretary Duffy promised senators at a hearing earlier this month that he would let the Tesla investigations follow the facts \u2014 specifically vowing to buck any political pressure to go easy on the self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d of the president.",
      "Musk will need all the regulatory relief and other goodies from Trump that he can get.",
      "In early January, Tesla said sales dropped in 2024, a first in more than a dozen years, as rivals such as BMW, Volkswagen and China\u2019s BYD come out with competitive EVs and steal market share.",
      "Then on Wednesday, Tesla reported revenue, profits and other key measures of financial health for the last quarter of 2024 all fell short of what analysts had expected. The stock climbed higher anyway.",
      "\u201cThings that would hurt other automakers,\u201c marvels Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, \u201ddon\u2019t seem to impact Tesla.\u201d",
      "Besides the business, Tesla shareholders must always keep one eye on the CEO himself. Lately, that\u2019s meant weighing Musk\u2019s foray into politics.",
      "In Europe, a major market for his cars, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who is running a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d",
      "On Inauguration Day in the U.S., Musk made a straight-arm gesture during a speech that many interpreted as Nazi salute. He scoffed at the criticism, but the backlash was fierce nonetheless. In Germany, an image of Musk making the salute was projected onto his massive Tesla factory outside Berlin in protest. In Italy, a communist youth group hung an effigy of Musk upside down in the same square in Milan where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was strung upside down, too.",
      "\u201cHow many of these Tesla buyers agree with Musk?\u201d said Felipe Munoz, a senior analyst at auto researcher Jato Dynamics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of alienating potential customers.\u201d",
      "Musk also risks turning off regulators in Europe, who he hopes will soon approve the use of Full Self-Driving there.",
      "If investors start losing faith in Musk, it\u2019s a long way down.",
      "The run-up in Tesla stock alone since the election amounts to more than the annual economic output of 160 countries. Tesla\u2019s total market value has grown to about $1.3 trillion, more than the worth of General Motors, BMW, Ford, Ferrari, Porsche and a dozen other top car makers combined.",
      "Musk thinks that, if anything, the stock should be higher.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be ripping up the province\u2019s contract with Starlink. Ontario won\u2019t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,\u201d Ford said.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is the only person to be blamed. Maybe Elon Musk can call his buddy? This is one of the ramifications.\u201d",
      "Ford said U.S.-based businesses will lose out on \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d in new revenues as a result of Ontario\u2019s response.",
      "\u201cWe just aren't going to be using American companies,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAnd no matter if we are building a hospital, if we're building anything, if we're building a dog house I want to make sure we are using Ontario steel, Canadian products, Canadian wood, Ontario wood, anything.",
      "\"I don't care if it's a toothpick. We need to purchase from Canada and Ontario.\u201d",
      "Ontario and other provinces already planned to remove American liquor brands from government store shelves. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario sells nearly $1 billion worth of American wine, beer, spirits and seltzers every year, Ford pointed.",
      "\u201cCanada didn\u2019t start this fight with the U.S., but you better believe we\u2019re ready to win it,\u201d said Ford, who called an election for his province last week.",
      "Ford said he wants a four year mandate that outlasts Trump's term. \u201cHe wants to come after us?\u201d he asked. \u201cI've yet to hear one American citizen say Canada is the problem.\u201d",
      "Canada and Mexico ordered retaliatory tariffs on American goods in response to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump. Ford also encouraged businesses to put the Canadian flag on products so Canadians know what to buy.",
      "\"This is a tax on American citizens. That\u2019s what Donald Trump is doing to his own people,\u201d said Ford, who described Musk as part of the Trump team \u201cthat wants to destroy families incomes, destroy businesses. He want to take food off the table of hard working people and I\u2019m not going to tolerate it.\u201d",
      "Trump responded Sunday, criticizing Canada\u2019s trade surplus with the United States and contending that without that surplus, \u201cCanada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada \u2014 AND NO TARIFFS!\u201d",

      "Off the field, Mizuhara was Ohtani\u2019s friend and confidant. He famously resigned from the Los Angeles Angels during the 2021 MLB lockout so he could keep speaking to Ohtani, and he was rehired after a deal was struck.",

One of them wore necklaces with pendants showing the number 9 and \u201cJB9,\u201d Burrow's jersey number.",

Investigators alleged one of the men was linked through phone records to one of the men charged in the Burrow home theft.",

      "Federal investigators said South American burglary crews, many in the country illegally or overstaying visas, have been targeting expensive homes next to green spaces, walking trails, golf courses and undeveloped land. They typically have been breaking in through rear windows or glass doors, on the second floor when possible, and targeting jewelry and designer accessories while leaving other valuables behind, authorities said.",
      "That's pretty much what happened at Burrow's home, despite a security team watching the property while Burrow and the Bengals were in Dallas playing the Cowboys. Someone at Burrow's house discovered it had been ransacked and a bedroom window was broken.",
      "The homeowners association gave police a video of a camera on a trail next to Burrow\u2019s house that showed a man walking through the woods with what appeared to be a piece of luggage.",
      "In the criminal complaint released Wednesday, an FBI agent wrote that authorities tracked the suspects to a hotel in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton, using cellphone location data and license plate readers. Investigators said they matched data from cell towers to the locations of a vehicle of interest identified by the license plate readers.",
      "Local prosecutors said four men were later taken into custody during a traffic stop \u2014 Jordan Francisco Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Alexander Esteban Huaiquil-Chavez, 24; Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, 23; and Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, 38. Sanchez, Morales and Cabello were indicted by the federal grand jury Wednesday.",
      "According to federal agents, Sanchez and Cabello told police that they were vacationing in Ohio to see the snow. Huaiquil-Chavez said he was visiting Ohio with the others but did not know their real names, the complaint said. Chavez acknowledged buying a glass-breaking tool at a Home Depot, but didn't say why, the document said.",
      "Authorities said they later found multiple photographs on the men's phones showing items stolen from Burrow's home.",

      "President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee",
      "President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Trump said Wednesday during a signing ceremony for an executive order aimed at banning transgender athletes from women's sports that his administration wants the IOC to \u201cchange everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject\" ahead of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.",
      "The order empowers the Secretary of State's office to pressure the IOC to amend standards governing Olympic sporting events \u201cto promote fairness, safety and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women\u2019s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.\u201d",
      "The order also calls for the Secretary of State and the Department of Homeland Security to \u201creview and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women\u2019s sports.\u201d There is no evidence that male athletes have competed in women's Olympics events.",
      "Outgoing IOC President Thomas Bach said in December that Olympic organizers were \u201cvery confident\u201d they could work with the Trump administration. The president initially backed Los Angeles during his first administration when the city bid for the 2024 Games that were awarded to Paris.",
      "Officials with the LA28 organizing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "LA28 organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman reportedly met with Trump in Florida last month before Trump\u2019s second term began, with Wasserman saying afterward both were looking forward to delivering a successful Games.",
      "The IOC has largely stayed out of the discussion around transgender athletes, letting the international governing bodies for each sport set the parameters for gender participation.",
      "The rules can run the gamut. Entities like World Aquatics have very strict guidelines, while World Triathlon rules are more liberal.",
      "The IOC's stance could change considerably in the near future following Bach's retirement. Among the candidates to replace Bach is former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.",
      "Two years ago, track and field under Coe banned transgender athletes from international competition \u2014 adopting the same rules as swimming \u2014 and adopted new regulations requiring some athletes to undergo hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before competing to be eligible.",
      "The rhetoric around transgender athletes heated up at the Paris Olympics last summer, with Trump eagerly entering the fray.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump frequently misgendered two Olympic female boxers as men and said their ability to participate in the Paris Games was \u201cdemeaning to women\u201d even though both Imane Khelif of Algeria and Li Yu-ting of Taiwan were assigned female at birth and identify as women.",
      "Trump referenced both athletes again on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThey had two women or two people that transitioned and both of them won gold medals and they won them very convincingly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut all of that ends today because with this executive order, the war on women\u2019s sports is over.\u201d",
      "The question going forward is what kind of leverage the United States can use to influence the IOC. Given the volatile nature of the issue, Trump's order could begin a groundswell among international federations for the IOC to come up with a uniform standard.",

    "story": [
      "Tom Brady addressed questions about his move to broadcasting as well as other issues on Wednesday during a conference call previewing Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl 59 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles",
      "Even though the scoreboard won\u2019t measure Tom Brady\u2019s performance in the Fox Sports booth during Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, he is trying to take the same approach that he did in his previous 10 appearances in the big game as a player.",
      "Brady addressed questions about his move to broadcasting as well as other issues on Wednesday during a conference call previewing Sunday\u2019s matchup in New Orleans between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "It was the first time Brady was made available for interviews. He has frequently appeared during the season on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no scoreboard for us. Did we feel we approached the game the right way, and were we prepared? Ultimately, it comes down to two things: Was I confident in what I said, and did I enjoy myself? I think if those are yes, then we did a good job,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited for what\u2019s ahead.\u201d",
      "Brady has received as much scrutiny as an analyst as he did during his 23 seasons quarterbacking the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he won seven Super Bowls.",
      "While the general consensus is that his first year in the booth has not been as good as Tony Romo\u2019s with CBS in 2017, Brady hasn\u2019t struggled as other former players and coaches who have attempted broadcasting.",
      "Kevin Burkhardt, who is calling his second Super Bowl, said he has noticed Brady\u2019s comfort level improve as the season progresses.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a reason that not everybody dives into this end of the pool because it\u2019s hard to be on TV for 3 1/2 hours every week and not have an edit button and go back and hit the delete button,\u201d Burkhardt said.",
      "\"I think the goal the whole way along was for us as a team to grow and get better as the year goes on. I think with anybody new, and I\u2019ve worked with enough new partners over the years, it takes time to build chemistry, whether they\u2019re a TV veteran or not, and I think with this, it\u2019s no different. It just takes time on task. So I\u2019m just proud of where we are.\"",
      "Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for Tampa Bay. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "Burkhardt and Brady had plenty of practice games during the season, but those took place mostly on the Fox Sports lot in Los Angeles and not viewed by millions. Brady, though, knew that the learning curve was going to be steep, but he was ready for the challenge.",
      "\u201cTo use your voice and vision for a live television audience, there\u2019s a lot of adrenaline in that, but it was very different from when I played. I would probably see all these things, I didn\u2019t have to verbalize them,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI knew subconsciously what to do, and my body just took over because that\u2019s how I trained it. When you embrace the uncertainty, you work as hard as you can to prepare yourself, knowing that you\u2019re going to wish you had done some things over. I\u2019ve enjoyed the learning curve.",
      "\u201cI love the ability to take the viewer inside of just the way that I see things. In some ways, it\u2019s very simple. In some ways, it\u2019s very complicated. I feel as a crew, we\u2019re all hitting our stride. We know each other better every week. Hopefully, this is our best game yet.\u201d",
      "Brady noted that along with feedback he has received from Fox Sports, Romo, NBC\u2019s Cris Collinsworth and Amazon Prime Video\u2019s Al Michaels have reached out.",
      "Along with Brady\u2019s approach to games as an analyst, there have also been questions about his dual roles in calling games and having a 5% stake as a limited owner in the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "The NFL put rules in place not allowing Brady to participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex.",
      "Fox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager said in an interview with The Associated Press last month that any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling games and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "Brady will be allowed this week to attend production meetings with Chiefs and Eagles players and coaches. He will not be able to view practices.",
      "Brady said that not being allowed in production meetings this season has not affected his research when preparing for games, even though there are other benefits he misses.",
      "\u201cI think the best part (of production meetings) is there are just genuine relationships that get built up over time, and it\u2019s a shared experience with people on your own crew sitting on calls and talking,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFrom a research standpoint, I listen to press conferences all week. To me, there\u2019s no difference in a media member asking a question on a Wednesday, Thursday or Friday press conference that would be any different from any of the questions I would ask or the crew would ask.\u201d",
      "Brady did not directly say how much of a role he took in the Raiders hirings of head coach Pete Carroll, general manager John Spytek, and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. Owner Mark Davis recently said that Brady had helped lead a committee that brought Carroll and Spytek to the Raiders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m there to support the team, the leadership, and the overall vision for success,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThis approach as a broadcaster has been all-encompassing this year. And the reality is that Mark Davis is the owner of the Raiders and I play a supportive, complementary role to the vision that he sets. And that will happen in its own time and place.\u201d",
      "While Brady\u2019s Patriots fell short in their quest for three straight Super Bowls, he said he would be happy to see Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs be the first team in the Super Bowl era to accomplish that feat.",
      "It would also be the fourth championship for Mahomes, putting him closer to Brady and a title record that few thought could be reached when he retired.",
      "\u201cI love seeing other people achieve great things and for people to detract from anything Patrick is doing, I don\u2019t believe will ever detract from what I accomplished in my career,\u201d Brady said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is we all have our journeys. The comparisons are fun naturally for the media because it serves a different perspective and context that people can write and talk about. But as a competitor that I was, I never viewed it that way, and I still don\u2019t today, even in the role that I am now.\u201d",

She\u2019s also a master in the intricate art of Black Masking suit design, a tradition deeply rooted in the Indigenous and African heritage of New Orleans.",
      "\u201cThey remind me of the happiest times in my life,\" she said. \"The design itself comes from New Orleans deep-rooted architecture. The historical parts of the city. We\u2019re known for food, the second-line band, you see the French Quarter.\u201d",
      "Williams' Super Bowl journey began when an NFL representative reached out to her through social media in February 2024. She spent about a month on the beadwork, describing the process as nothing short of peaceful.",
      "For Williams, creativity is the perfect escape from her day job as a cybersecurity engineer at Microsoft. Her beadwork was a step-by-step process, focusing on the Super Bowl's Roman numbers of LIX (59) first, then fleshing out the rest.",
      "\u201cI don't really look at this as a chore. Depends on your mindset,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't look at the full piece that I'm trying to bead. We call it a patch. I'll start with the L. Then I'll do the I before the X. I'll work on the trophy then the wording. I don't look at the whole thing because I'll get discouraged. You need to do it in a way where you can see progress.\"",
      "The NFL said Williams' work honors the cultural roots of New Orleans, calling her the \u201cperfect artist.\"",
      "As a local artist, Williams knows plenty of talented individuals who may not have the same marketability as those with larger audiences. She hopes more major organizations, like the NFL, will recognize and provide opportunities to proven local talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about continuing on this pattern of local artists, small artists getting these big opportunities,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you have a little bit more followers, it\u2019s easier for these big organizations with these amazing opportunities to find you. I just want these bigger organizations to try their hardest to find those smaller artists that still make beautiful, amazing work, but just may not have the kind of marketing behind them that a larger artist would.\u201d",
      "Williams, who was the captain of her middle school football team, said she'll be attending a Super Bowl for the first time. She wants to keep certain memorabilia like a jacket filled with lapel pins, a game ticket and a Bud Light sign that lights up, even though she\u2019s not a beer drinker.",
      "As the big game draws closer, Williams grows more excited.",
      "\u201cThe culture and artistry will be on display for the Super Bowl,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm looking forward to it.\u201d",

      "Vic Fangio\u2019s coaching career started in the 1970s as a high school assistant in Pennsylvania and has taken him across the country in various stops as he grew into one of the most innovative defensive coaches in the game",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Vic Fangio's coaching career started in the 1970s as a high school assistant in Pennsylvania and has taken him across the country in various stops as he grew into one of the most innovative defensive coaches in the game.",
      "Now at age 66, Fangio is at the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where he started his NFL coaching career, as defensive coordinator with the Philadelphia Eagles team he grew up supporting with a chance to fill one of the few remaining gaps on a stellar career.",
      "\u201cI grew up a Philadelphia sports fan,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cPhillies, Eagles, Sixers, started my pro career in Philadelphia with the USFL. And now I\u2019ll probably end it here one of these years. It\u2019s kind of come full circle. ... I kind of fit there.\u201d",
      "Fangio has incorporated eight new starters into a defense that ranked near the bottom of the NFL in 2023 and turned it into one of the league's best as the Eagles led the NFL in advanced efficiency metrics and allowed the second-fewest points in the league.",
      "He is a major reason why the Eagles are in the Super Bowl, giving Fangio the success he couldn't achieve in a failed head coaching stint in Denver and a chance to win his first Super Bowl in 38 seasons in the NFL.",
      "\u201cI still really like to do it. I think I\u2019m still halfway decent at it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. If you hang around long enough the tide will turn.\u201d",
      "Fangio began his NFL career coaching one of the top linebacking groups ever for New Orleans' \u201cDome Patrol\u201d teams in 1986 and got his first chance as defensive coordinator for expansion Carolina in 1995.",
      "He has spent nearly all of his time since in the NFL, with a one-year break to go to Stanford, and his defensive style that disguises coverages and tries to keep two safeties as deep as possible to limit big plays has been mimicked throughout the league.",
      "His only previous trip to the Super Bowl came in the 2012 season with San Francisco, when he lost to Baltimore here at the Superdome.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about coaches, sometimes you're like \u2018He\u2019s been a good coach for years.\u2019 He\u2019s very good coach for decades, which is impressive,\u201d Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s had an unbelievable career and done so many good things and just so grateful that he\u2019s on the staff. He has the standard of how it\u2019s supposed to look and holds the guys to that standard. He\u2019s not afraid to tell you what he thinks if you don\u2019t meet the standard and praise you if you do meet the standards.\u201d",
      "Fangio has been integral in the defensive rebuild in Philadelphia. He saw enough in free agent Zack Baun to turn him from a special teams player who got limited time on defense as an outside rusher in New Orleans into an All-Pro inside linebacker and finalist for AP Defensive Player of the Year in Philadelphia.",
      "He also helped incorporate two rookie starters in the secondary in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, which played a big part in the turnaround.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s like a father figure,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hold you accountable. He\u2019s serious. But he\u2019s got jokes too. He\u2019s funny as well.\"",
      "But Fangio will face his toughest test on Sunday when the Eagles face Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.",
      "While much has been made out of Fangio's 0-8 record against Mahomes as a head coach in Denver and play-caller in Miami, he never had a defense as talented as this one when he faced him.",
      "The record diminishes what Fangio did on defense as his teams scored just 11.9 points per game in those games. Fangio's defenses allowed only 21.6 points per game to the Kansas City offense \u2014 the Chiefs got six additional TDs on defense and special teams \u2014 and Mahomes threw only 10 TD passes in the eight games and had a lower passer rating (95.9) and yards per attempt (7.3) than his career average.",
      "\u201cEvery time I've played Coach Fangio, there's been different changeups and different things he's thrown at us,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThat's what makes him so great. He won\u2019t do what he did the last time.\u201d",
      "Mahomes called games against Fangio a \"chess match\" and Fangio stressed the importance of changing up schemes because of Mahomes' \u201celite\u201d ability to understand what a defense is doing both before the snap and after.",
      "\u201cThere is no secret. This is his seventh year as a starter. No one has gotten the formula to beat him,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cHe\u2019s won the chess match against me, the final score. We\u2019ll see if there's something we can come up with.\u201d",

      "\u201cTheir side hasn\u2019t raised it, we certainly haven\u2019t raised it. ... Any commentary outside of a formal negotiation is just commentary,\u201d Howell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a players\u2019 decision as to what they will agree to do or not. Right now when I have talked to players over the last two seasons, no one wants to play an 18th game. No one. Seventeen games, for many of the guys, is too long.\u201d",
      "Of course, the players\u2019 union would want the league to make several concessions in order to agree to an 18th game.",
      "Jalen Reeves-Maybin, a linebacker for the Lions and NFLPA president, wouldn\u2019t specify what the players may want in return.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair for us to speak for everyone,\u201d Reeves-Maybin said. \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of guys and we haven\u2019t been deep enough into the conversation.\u201d",
      "Players are expected to want more money, another bye week, amendments to the offseason calendar, improvement of playing surfaces, a larger roster and much more. Time off between games, especially international games, is another issue.",

      "Distribution of revenue will be a major point.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m asking my work force to work more, it\u2019s not as simple as I\u2019m gonna fall back on the revenue split that already exists,\u201d Howell said. \u201cThere are so many dimensions that hang off the length of the season.\u201d",
      "Many players felt the NFLPA should have extracted more concessions during the most recent labor negotiations so the 2020 CBA only passed by a slim margin of votes, 1,019 to 959.",
      "Under the current CBA, the players\u2019 share of league revenue increased from 47% to 48% starting in 2021. A \u201cmedia kicker\u201d that went into effect with the 17-game regular-season schedule grew that share to 48.5% based on an increase in revenue from the league\u2019s new television contracts. The maximum amount the players could\u2019ve reached was 48.8%. They\u2019re going to want at least 50% to add another game.",
      "\u201cThis time of year, the training room is pretty full,\u201d Texans quarterback Case Keenum said. \u201cA lot of us are struggling to get our bodies right. I know most of my teammates don\u2019t feel normal until July when it\u2019s time for another season.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Steve Spagnuolo was interviewed by several teams during this hiring cycle, and for good reason: He\u2019s long been considered one of the best defensive minds in the game",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Every once in a while, when an unsuspecting offense is least expecting it, Kansas City Chiefs safety Justin Reid will inch his way toward the line of scrimmage, then take off like a thunderbolt toward the quarterback the moment the ball is snapped.",
      "It looks so simple, the way Reid blitzes, as if all he's doing is timing up the QB's cadence.",
      "Turns out it is far more complicated.",
      "The timing is a big part of it, of course, but so is the way defensive linemen tie up the offensive line. The way the rest of the defensive backfield disguises coverage. The way pass rushers stunt or otherwise provide pressure on the quarterback from the outside, making him move to the exact point on the field where Reid expects to meet him.",
      "The mad scientist pulling all those strings is Steve Spagnuolo, the Chiefs defensive coordinator, whose job in helping Kansas City get back to the Super Bowl had him interviewing with several clubs last week for another shot at being a head coach.",
      "\u201cHe's incredible,\u201d Reid said ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles. \u201cMy first year here, like, the amount of pressures and cover-zeros and simulated pressures \u2014 the sheer volume of it was a little bit like, \u2018Wow, this is really deep.\u2019 But as you get a ton of reps at it and start to get a feel for the defense, you're almost hungry for it. Like, \u2018Let\u2019s put in more, put in something else nobody has ever seen.'\u201d",
      "Hard to believe there is something left to invent.",
      "But that deep, complicated defensive playbook and all those exotic blitzes that \u201cSpags\u201d has developed over the years are a big reason why the Chiefs are back facing the Eagles on the NFL's biggest stage.",
      "\u201cI love this defense, man. Spags, we've always trusted him and everybody that plays under him,\u201d Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said. \u201cThey're so sound and they play their tails off, and they throw their heart out there on the field every single week.\u201d",
      "In the early years of their dynastic run, the Chiefs defense was a liability, and it was up to Patrick Mahomes and the rest of a high-powered offense to bail it out. But that changed when Spagnuolo arrived, and general manager Brett Veach began investing free-agent money and draft capital into upgrades on that side of the ball. The result has been a defense among the NFL's best in scoring the past few years, and one that was particularly good against the run this season.",
      "That could prove pivotal as the Chiefs try to slow down Eagles running back Saquon Barkley in the big game.",
      "And when it comes to slowing down the passing attack, well, that's where blitzes come into play. They can come from any level of the defense, at any point in time, and the only thing they have in common is the frequency in which they succeed.",
      "\u201cHe doesn't do it every down,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cSometimes you get the stigma of being a \u2018blitz guy.\u2019 It's when he does it and how he knows the protections or the run scheme, you know, for the run blitzes. How he understands the scheme and when to go about using it. I think that's what makes him so unique and why they're so successful.\u201d",
      "The success of the Kansas City defense coupled with Spagnuolo's relatable personality have made him a fan favorite, and why the Jets and Jaguars were among the teams that interviewed him for their head coaching vacancies.",
      "Spagnuolo had a chance with the Rams from 2009-11, going 10-38 as a head coach. But the deck was stacked against him; the team was unsettled at quarterback, the most important position in the game, and was in the midst of a major rebuilding effort.",
      "Andy Reid would love to see his longtime friend get another chance. But in the meantime, he's thankful Spagnuolo and so much of his defensive staff have remained intact for several years, providing consistency on that side of the ball.",
      "\u201cThey know the scheme like the back of their hand. Spags has confidence in them and then the players have confidence in their coaches and Spags,\u201d Reid said. \"You have to stay focused during the meetings, you have to detail it at practice, you have to detail the walkthroughs that you do meetings on the field. Then, most of all, you have to execute it on game day. But there\u2019s that trust, that whole foundation that you\u2019ve built with the trust and these guys, they\u2019ve got that.",
      "\"Then, likewise, I have the confidence in Spags and in certain situations. I don\u2019t run over to him and go, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s not do that or this.\u2019 I have enough confidence in him and been around him long enough to know he\u2019s going to make the right call.\u201d",

      "The average price for the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles game at TickPick was $6,552 as of Tuesday. If that amount holds, it would be that website's third highest for a Super Bowl.",
      "Last year's game between the Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers had an average price at that site of $9,136. The only other Super Bowl to attract a higher average price was four years ago when the amount was $7,046 for Chiefs' game against the hometown Tampa Bay Buccaneers when the crowd was limited to 25,000 fans because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The lowest price for this year's game was just less than $4,000, which has declined about 30% since the matchup was set.",

      "TickPick co-CEO Brett Goldberg said there were a number of reasons why ticket prices are notably lower than last year.",
      "That game was the first in Las Vegas, creating even more fan interest than usual. The close proximity of Allegiant Stadium to the nation's eighth-busiest airport and Las Vegas Strip entertainment corrider that includes many of the world's largest hotels contributed to record prices.",
      "Hotel capacity in New Orleans is more limited with about 26,000 rooms in the city center, and even home rentals are at a premium.",
      "\u201cIf you try to go book a hotel right now, it's very challenging,\u201d Goldberg said.",
      "Another problem is the matchup.",
      "This is the third Super Bowl in a row for the Chiefs and the second in three years for the Eagles.",
      "\u201cI think if the Bills won, you would've seen a very different dynamic here,\u201d Goldberg said. \"There's a part of that (Chiefs) fan base that can afford to go to the Super Bowl three times, but that's a very small (segment of the) fan base that could do that.",
      "\u201cEven the Eagles have a little bit of a fatigue from being at a Super Bowl two years ago. We're hearing directly from fans, \u2018I went two years ago. I\u2019m not sure I could pull this off.' Would they love to go? Sure, but the impracticality on it's a $10,000 trip for two becomes very limiting.\u201d",
      "Goldberg said he hasn't received feedback that the New Year's Day terrorist attack in which 14 people were killed by a motorist on Bourbon Street played a significant part in the price decline.",
      "New Orleans is about to host its 11th Super Bowl, though first in 12 years.",
      "But the been-there, done-that feel is another factor, Goldberg said, and one Las Vegas could eventually face as well at one point.",
      "\u201cBy the time you do it a third time, the stadium won't be as new,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cI do think it could lose some of its appeal.\u201d",

      "Mahomes lifted the Chiefs to an overtime win against San Francisco in another Super Bowl rematch last year. Now, they\u2019re poised for a three-peat, a word coach Andy Reid doesn\u2019t use much.",

      "Reid won more games than any coach in franchise history during his 14 seasons in Philadelphia but couldn\u2019t win the big one, going 1-4 in NFC championship games and losing a Super Bowl to the Patriots. He went right to Kansas City after the Eagles fired him following the 2012 season and has built a dynasty thanks to Mahomes, Kelce, Chris Jones and others.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have time to think about all that,\u201d Reid said of the three-peat. \u201cYou\u2019re focused in on the job at hand here and that\u2019s playing against a great Eagles team.\u201d",
      "Jones, the three-time All-Pro defensive tackle, echoed his coach\u2019s viewpoint.",

We understand there\u2019s one more game until the offseason and we can do whatever we want to do. Our main focus is making sure we\u2019re prepared for the Eagles.\u201d",

No team has done it in the Super Bowl era, though the Green Bay Packers won an NFL championship in 1965 and followed by winning the first two Super Bowls. Kelce even started all the three-peat talk on stage last year when he said the team\u2019s goal was to win three.",
      "\u201cThis is gonna be our biggest test yet,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThey got a lot of great players but the biggest thing is they play great together. You could see their communication. You could see the accountability they have, especially in the secondary. It\u2019s not gonna make my job any easier.\u201d",
      "These Eagles are different from the group that fell just short against Kansas City in Arizona two years ago.",
      "They have the NFL\u2019s most dynamic player in the backfield. Barkley rushed for 2,447 yards with seven touchdowns of 60-plus yards in the regular season and playoffs.",
      "\u201cThe goal has always been to win it, not just to get here,\u201d Barkley said.",
      "Losing to the Chiefs two years ago only motivated Hurts even more. He\u2019s determined to hoist a Lombardi trophy and even had a photo of him walking off the field with Kansas City\u2019s red and yellow confetti falling around him as the background on his phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s had a great driving force,\u201d Hurts said of that loss. \u201cIt lit a flame, lit a fire in me, and to have this opportunity again is exactly what you work for.\u201d",
      "Hurts, Barkley, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and a dominant offensive line present a major challenge for Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.",
      "The Eagles also have the league\u2019s No. 1-ranked defense, featuring eight new starters from 2022 and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio.",
      "All-Pro linebacker Zack Baun and rookie cornerbacks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean plus the emergence of defensive tackle Jalen Carter and edge rusher Nolan Smith has transformed a defensive unit that fell apart last season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have Steve Spagnuolo, but I tell you that Vic is one of those guys,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHe\u2019s just one of those really creative defensive minds that survived a long time in this league. He\u2019s been time-tested, and, he has the trust of his players.\u201d",
      "If the Chiefs win, Reid and Mahomes will be one step closer to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. They\u2019re halfway to the six Belichick and Brady won together in New England and Mahomes is still four away from Brady\u2019s seven rings.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to be the greatest Patrick Mahomes that I can be. That\u2019s obviously a goal of anyone\u2019s \u2014 to be the greatest at their profession \u2014 but in order to do that, you have to be the greatest that you can be every single day,\u201d Mahomes said.",
      "\u201cWhenever I\u2019m done with football, if I leave everything out there \u2014 the way that I feel like I have so far \u2014 as far as effort and mentality, I\u2019ll be happy with the results.\u201d",
      "A win for Kansas City also would give Kelce his fourth ring, the same number of Grammy Awards his pop star girlfriend has won for best album. Overall, Kelce has 18 playoff wins and Swift has 14 Grammys.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s up there being the superstar that she is and never taking no for an answer and always working her tail off. I better match that energy for sure,\u201d Kelce said.",

      "The U.S. Open is the first major to publish a pathway for players from Saudi-funded LIV Golf",
      "The U.S. Open became the first major to publish a direct pathway for LIV Golf players, on Wednesday announcing a new exemption category that awards one spot to the leading player from among the top three at LIV\u2019s halfway point this year.",
      "The next exemption category will include one spot this year from the May 19 standings in LIV. Starting with the 2026 U.S. Open, the USGA will take the leading player in the final 2025 individual standings, along with the leading player from the May 18, 2026, list.",
      "In each case, the exemption goes to the leading player not already exempt, and the player must be among the top three in the standings.",
      "The other majors have not turned away players from the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League. The Masters has invited Joaquin Niemann each of the last two years, though Augusta National based that on his international play.",
      "The PGA Championship has invited LIV players based on their world ranking, and for 2024 at Valhalla it invited Talor Gooch, who had won three times on LIV the previous year. But the PGA of America does not have specific criteria, lumping LIV players and others into \u201cspecial invitations.\u201d Niemann and Sergio Garcia already have received PGA invitations this year.",
      "For this year\u2019s U.S. Open, an exemption from qualifying will be given \u201cthe top player who is not otherwise exempt and in the top three\" of the LIV individual standings as of May 19.",
      "That could mean no one gets that exemption if the leading three are already eligible. Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Richard Bland, Phil Mickelson and Cameron Smith are LIV players currently exempt.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the USGA has formally created a new exemption for LIV Golf players to compete in the U.S. Open and appreciate Mike Whan\u2019s leadership and commitment to growing the game of golf,\" said Scott O'Neil, the new CEO of LIV Golf.",
      "\u201cEvery golf fan in the world longs to see the greatest players in the world competing on golf\u2019s biggest stages at the majors,\u201d O'Neil said. \"LIV Golf is committed to working hand in hand with golf\u2019s governing bodies to elevate the sport in all corners of the world.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Open is June 12-15 at Oakmont Country Club in the Pittsburgh suburbs.",
      "\u201cThe USGA continues to evaluate the pathways that exist to ensure those playing their best have the opportunity to compete in our national championship,\u201d said John Bodenhamer, the USGA chief championships officer.",
      "\u201cConsistent with our historical approach, we continuously evaluate talent levels on professional tours and in amateur events, which has led us to add a new exemption category.\u201d",
      "In addition to the new category, the USGA will offer exemptions from the first stage of 18-hole qualifying starting next year to the top 10 players on the LIV points list on April 7, 2026. Five LIV events will have been played by then.",
      "LIV begins its fourth season on Thursday under the lights at Riyadh Golf Club in Saudi Arabia, equipped with its first network deal with Fox Sports. It also has events scheduled for Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Miami and South Korea before the U.S. Open exemption deadline.",
      "Players from the breakaway league always have been able to go through qualifying \u2014 four LIV players made it through U.S. Open qualifying last year. But having a set target could be seen as a boost, particularly to young players who have no status on established tours.",
      "Among the young players who joined LIV Golf this year are Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland, Frederik Kjettrup of Denmark, Luis Masaveu of Spain and Yubin Jang of South Korea.",

      "The National Women\u2019s Soccer League will establish a $5 million fund for players as part of a settlement that stemmed from allegations of emotional and sexual misconduct that rocked the league in 2021",
      "The National Women's Soccer League will establish a $5 million fund for players as part of a settlement that stemmed from allegations of emotional and sexual misconduct that rocked the league in 2021.",
      "Attorneys general from Washington, D.C., Illinois and New York announced the settlement with the league on Wednesday.",
      "The funds will go to players who experienced abuse. The settlement also requires the league to maintain safeguards put into place following a pair of investigations released in late 2022 that found widespread misconduct that impacted multiple teams, coaches and players.",
      "It also gives the attorneys general, Brian L. Schwalb of Washington, D.C., Letitia James of New York and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, the ability to oversee changes that the NWSL made after the scandal broke, and the ability to fine the league if it fails to uphold those changes.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s settlement is only possible because of the players who courageously stepped forward to tell their stories and expose the league\u2019s systemic failures. While NWSL has made critical improvements, the victims never received any compensation for the sexual and emotional abuse they endured on the league\u2019s watch,\u201d Schwalb said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cNo dollar amount could ever fully address the damage that was inflicted, but now my office, together with New York and Illinois, will have oversight authority to ensure that the league\u2019s new safety policies are implemented and that current and future players are protected.\u201d",
      "A pair of former players \u2014 Sinead Farrelly and Mana Shim \u2014 came forward in 2021 and accused longtime NWSL coach Paul Riley of sexual harassment and coercion.",
      "Riley, who has denied the allegations, was fired by the North Carolina Courage in the aftermath. He was among five head coaches in the league who were either fired or resigned in 2021 amid claims of misconduct. The NWSL commissioner at the time also resigned.",
      "Both the NWSL and U.S. Soccer launched investigations into the allegations. The U.S. Soccer report was led by former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Q. Yates, who found emotional abuse and sexual misconduct were \u201csystemic\u201d in the sport.",
      "Following the investigation, the NWSL implemented changes to protect players. The NWSL Players Association also negotiated safeguards in the league's collective bargaining agreement.",
      "\u201cThis investigation was initiated by the NWSLPA because players refused to stay silent in the face of systemic abuse. The human rights and civil rights violations they endured were enabled by a system that failed in its most basic duty: to protect its players,\u201d said Meghann Burke, NWSLPA executive director. \u201cThis settlement not only acknowledges those failures but, for the first time, establishes enforcement mechanisms under the law to hold NWSL accountable and to prevent future harm.\"",
      "Among the safeguards that are mandated to continue include comprehensive vetting of certain team personnel, mechanisms for players to report abuse, player access to free and unlimited counseling, access to a league safety officer and policies that prevent teams from investigating themselves.",
      "The NWSL played its inaugural season in 2013. The professional women's league now has 14 teams, with two more joining in 2026.",
      "\u201cThis settlement sends a clear message that such misconduct will not be tolerated and ensures players receive the compensation and protections they deserve,\u201d James said in a statement. \"Every athlete should be able to compete in a safe, supportive environment, and I thank the brave individuals who came forward to share their experiences.\u201d",

      "The event is being paid for by in-kind donations, and much is being done at cost with the aim of making it a fundraiser, as well as a community gathering.",
      "\"We all need a lot of support right now,\" Leonsis said. \u201cI hope we can raise a lot of money. At the end of the day, we not only want to be able to collectively bring all of the voices of all of the people affected, but we need to be able to raise a lot of dollars to help ease some of the pain.\u201d",

Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. A year ago, the 16,000-seat arena that\u2019s supposed to welcome back NHL players to the Olympics was still a giant construction pit. But work has been carried out rapidly and the skeleton of the facility now rises 35 meters (115 feet) above street level, serving as a majestic sight to those arriving into the southeastern periphery of Milan. After the Olympics, the multipurpose facility being built by private investors is likely to become the next destination of the ATP Finals.

While all the ice hockey finals will be held in the Santagiulia Arena, some matches will take place in the Fiera Milano exhibition venue, which will also host the speed skating. The so-called Ice Park will occupy four pavilions of the huge exhibition center and comprise the Speed Skating Stadium and the Rho Ice Hockey Arena. The trade fair complex, which opened in 2005 in the northwest of Milan, will use temporary structures for the Games.4. Ice Skating Arena. Short-track speed skating and figure skating events will take place in the Forum di Milano, a multipurpose facility that is mainly used for basketball, ice hockey and tennis as well as live concerts. The 12,500-capacity venue in the southwestern outskirts of Milan was opened in 1990 and renovated in 2017, the year before it hosted the figure skating world championships.",

      "There are several athletes to look out for at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics",
      "MILAN -- Coming out of retirement, switching allegiances or simply looking to continue their dominance of their sport. Here are eight athletes who, if they avoid mishaps along the way, could make a mark on the Milan-Cortina Olympics:",
      "Lindsey Vonn made a shock comeback to ski racing in December at age 40 and she has the Olympics in her sights. Vonn, who has a new titanium knee, is planning to retire for the second \u2014 and final \u2014 time after next year\u2019s Olympics, when women\u2019s races will be held on one of her favorite courses in Cortina. Vonn specializes in the super-G and downhill and is the all-time leader in World Cup downhill victories with 43. The American has a total of 82 World Cup wins and clinched Olympic gold in the downhill in 2010 as well as bronze in both the super-G in 2010 and downhill in 2018. Vonn proved she can still be competitive when she finished sixth and fourth in a downhill and a super-G in St. Anton, Austria, last month.",
      "Mikaela Shiffrin might be the winningest racer in World Cup history with 99 victories but the American standout will be targeting Olympic redemption at next year\u2019s Games. Shiffrin won gold in the slalom in 2014 and also in the giant slalom four years later but she floundered spectacularly in Beijing in 2022, skiing out on the first run of both her signature events. Shiffrin recently returned to the circuit after two months out with injury and the 29-year-old finished 10th on her comeback World Cup slalom in Courchevel, France.",
      "The \u201cQuad God\u201d is coming to the Olympics. Ilia Malinin\u2019s performances are built around high-risk, high-reward quadruple jumps. He landed six of them on his way to a third U.S. figure skating title in January, including the quad axel, which involves four-and-a-half turns in the air. Only Malinin has ever landed it in competition. The Olympic Games are a family tradition for the 20-year-old from Virginia, whose parents were both Olympians for Uzbekistan. Malinin will aim to carry on the legacy of Nathan Chen, whose \u201cRocket Man\u201d skate won gold for the U.S. in 2022.",
      "Multinational freeskiing sensation Eileen Gu burst onto the world stage at the Beijing Winter Olympics, aged just 18, as she became the first action-sports athlete to take three medals in one Games. Gu won two golds ( big air, halfpipe ) and one silver (slopestyle) in China. Born in California, Gu decided to ski for China to inspire girls in her mother\u2019s homeland and show them what is possible on the snow. Gu has also won three golds and a bronze at the X Games as well as two world championship golds and a bronze. She is practically unbeatable on the halfpipe, emerging victorious on 14 of her 17 World Cup starts. The 21-year-old is also a model and a student at Stanford.",
      "Chloe Kim is a pioneer of women\u2019s snowboarding and has had an air of invincibility on the halfpipe ever since she burst onto the international scene at the 2018 Games, becoming the youngest woman to win an Olympic snowboarding gold medal \u2014 aged just 17. Kim doubled up in Beijing as she joined three-time Olympic champion Shaun White as the only snowboarder to win back-to-back titles on the halfpipe. The 24-year-old American is also an eight-time X Games gold medalist.",
      "An Olympic medal is the dream for any athlete. An Olympic medal on home snow in the sport\u2019s debut in the Games, even more so. That is what Italian Nicol\u00f2 Ernesto Canclini is aiming for when ski mountaineering \u2014 or \u201cSkimo\u201d \u2014 makes its debut at the Milan-Cortina Games. Moreover, Canclini lives just 300 meters from the Olympic slope in Bormio. The 28-year-old Canclini is a world-class athlete, one of the top in his sport, but nowhere near to a household name in Italy. That could all change next year.",
      "Brazil has a rare realistic shot at what would be its first-ever medal at the Winter Olympics. Lucas Pinheiro Braathen became the first Brazilian skier to finish on a World Cup podium when he placed second in a giant slalom in Beaver Creek, Colorado, in December. He was third in a slalom in Kitzbuehel last month. The 24-year-old Pinheiro Braathen\u2019s mother is Brazilian and his father is Norwegian. He had raced for Norway until abruptly retiring in 2023, shortly after winning the slalom world cup title, after getting into a dispute with the Norwegian ski federation following modeling work for a rival brand of the federation\u2019s clothing supplier. Pinheiro Braathen has five career World Cup race wins, three in slalom and two in giant slalom. He competed for Norway at the 2022 Beijing Olympics but did not complete either race.",
      "It doesn't matter how many times the 36-year-old Norwegian cross-country skiing star says she will not compete at the Winter Games next year; everyone seems to be waiting for her to change her mind. Like Vonn, Johaug came out of retirement last year \u2014 and it is clear she is in top form even after two years away from the sport. Last month she claimed her fourth Tour de Ski victory at the Val di Fiemme venue that will host cross country skiing at next year\u2019s Olympics. Johaug, who has four Olympic gold medals from Vancouver 2010 and Beijing 2022, plus one silver and one bronze from Sochi 2014, has insisted she will quit for good after this season. Nevertheless, Norway hopes she will postpone her retirement by just one more year.",

      "MADRID -- The brother of Jenni Hermoso and one of her teammates told a judge Wednesday there were attempts to pressure the player into downplaying the unsolicited kiss by former Spanish federation president Luis Rubiales in the awards presentation ceremony following the 2023 Women's World Cup.",
      "Rafael Hermoso said in court that former women\u2019s national team coach Jorge Vilda asked him to tell Jenni to record a video together with the former president to show she was OK with the kiss.",

      "Jenni Hermoso says she did not consent to the kiss while Rubiales says it was consensual. The kiss marred the title celebrations and sparked outrage in Spain about the prevalence of sexism in sports and beyond.",
      "Rafael Hermoso said his sister told him she was pressurised several times by members of the Spanish federation.",

      "Rodr\u00edguez said Jenni told them about the kiss and that she did not know how to react to it. She also said that Jenni told them she was being pressurised to record a video and downplay the kiss.",
      "\u201cShe told us that she didn't want to do it and we supported her decision,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cWe told her that she should not talk to anybody anymore and should try to get some rest, because we noticed that she was not well.\u201d",
      "Rafael Hermoso said Vilda came to him on the plane returning from the final in Australia to ask him to talk to his sister.",

      "Rafael added that Vilda told him that Rubiales\u2019 daughters were crying and that the president was worried about losing his job because of what happened. He said Vilda told him that he had already talked to Jenni and that she had not agreed to do the video.",
      "\u201cI told him that I was not going to try to convince her to do something that I also don\u2019t agree with,\u201d Rafael said.",
      "Rafael said he felt Vilda threatened his sister by hinting that things would not be good for her in the federation if she decided not to help. He also said Vilda implied that Jenni owed that to Rubiales\u2019 daughters and the president himself.",
      "Jenni Hermoso was not called up to the national team immediately after the World Cup, with new coach Montse Tom\u00e9 saying she wanted to protect the player.",

      "Prosecutors, Hermoso and the Spain players\u2019 association want Rubiales jailed for two and a half years, fined 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages, and banned from working as a sports official. They want the other three defendants sentenced to one and a half years in prison.",
      "The trial is expected to last at least 10 days. Rubiales attended the first day on Monday. The coach of the men's national team, Luis de la Fuente, testified on Tuesday.",

      "Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China under a new partnership with the Shanghai government",
      "TOKYO -- Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday, under a new partnership with the Shanghai government.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. also announced it will start producing batteries for EVs, hybrids and plug-ins at a new $14 billion facility in North Carolina, with shipping starting for North American models in April.",
      "The moves highlight Toyota\u2019s aggressive push in electric cars, a sector where some critics have said it\u2019s fallen behind rivals like Tesla and BYD at a time when the Chinese EV market is booming and the world's concerns about sustainability are increasingly crucial.",
      "Toyota is setting up a company in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai for that effort, with production of the new Lexus EVs starting in 2027.",
      "Initial production capacity there totals 100,000 vehicles a year, which will create about 1,000 jobs, the world\u2019s top automaker said. The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.",
      "Toyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect next week.",
      "\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.",
      "Also Wednesday, Toyota reported fiscal third quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.",
      "Toyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.",
      "Last year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.",
      "Toyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.",
      "The new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.",
      "Toyota said it hopes to contribute to the Chinese government\u2019s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.",
      "\u201cLocal Chinese members will take the lead in planning and developing BEVs that match the unique needs of Chinese customers. Our goal is to become a company that is more loved and supported by the people of China,\u201d said Miyazaki.",

      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",

      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers are in what one described as \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites and electronic publications.",
      "Late last week, federal agencies took down scores of government webpages as staffers hurried to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s order rolling back protections for transgender people, which required the removal of \u201cgender ideology\u201d language from websites, contracts and emails.",
      "Some of the sites were back online Monday, but data analysts say it's not clear exactly what was removed or changed.",
      "\u201cYou go looking for something and it's just not there,\u201d said Amy O'Hara, a Georgetown University researcher who is president of the Association of Public Data Users.",

      "It sparked \u201ca mad scramble right now\u201d to grab copies of whatever federal data was posted before, O'Hara said.",
      "While the administration's stated goal was to delete gender and transgender terminology, O'Hara said some researchers worry that other politically charged topics \u2014 such as climate change or vaccines \u2014 might be removed or altered.",
      "A expert panel affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanded a meeting on the deletions.",

      "Experts say datasets and summaries were affected, but so too were codebooks that explain different variables. They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is quite stunning,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "Researchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "On Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: \u201cCDC\u2019s website is being modified to comply with President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d The agency's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.",

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products",
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, while the U.S. Postal Service announced it will stop accepting parcels inbound from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "Google did not immediately comment on the investigation.",
      "Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics, said that the investigation could be related to Google\u2019s dominance in the Android business, as virtually all smartphone brands apart from Apple and Huawei would have to pay licensing fees to Google to use the Android system on their devices.",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Elon Musk's lawyers faced off with OpenAI in court Tuesday as a federal judge weighed the billionaire's request for a court order that would block the ChatGPT maker from converting itself to a for-profit company.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn't intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.",
      "But the judge also raised concerns about OpenAI and its relationship with business partner Microsoft and said she wouldn't stop the case from moving to trial as soon as next year so a jury can decide.",
      "\u201cIt is plausible that what Mr. Musk is saying is true. We\u2019ll find out. He\u2019ll sit on the stand,\u201d she said.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "Musk escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff.",
      "Also targeted by Musk's lawsuit is OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft and tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member who also sits on Microsoft's board.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers said she has a high bar for approving the kind of preliminary injunction that Musk wants but hasn't yet ruled on the request.",
      "She has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple's fight with Epic Games, though she said Tuesday that Musk's case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one. Then-President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench in 2011.",
      "Tuesday's hearing was originally set for January but was postponed after Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said his house was destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire.",
      "Musk, who did not attend the hearing, has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI has said Musk\u2019s requested court order would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "He had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI has sought to demonstrate Musk\u2019s early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "Musk is not the only one challenging OpenAI's for-profit transition. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has asked California's attorney general to block it, and the office of Delaware's attorney general has said it is reviewing the conversion.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google's digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn't enough to offset investors' worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.",
      "The October-December results released Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet Inc. showed the company is continuing to reap even more profits from its dominant search engine and other peripheral services.",
      "Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year\u2019s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.",
      "More importantly, revenue growth in the Google Cloud division tethered to the AI craze wasn't as robust as had been anticipated.",
      "That letdown contributed to a more than 8% drop in Alphabet's stock price after the numbers came out. The downturn reversed a recent rally that had elevated Alphabet's shares to a new all-time high earlier Tuesday during the regular trading session.",
      "\u201cThe reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.",
      "But the AI-generated overviews that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.",
      "\u201cThe early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,\u201d said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. \"What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.\u201d",
      "But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t he Chinese startup DeepSeek found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.",
      "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.",
      "\u201cThe company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,\u201d Pichai said.",
      "Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that in its AI principles signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.",
      "The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

      "U.S. and British scientists used photos and data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the area and calculate the path of debris that produced these canyons about 3.8 billion years ago. They reported their findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The incoming space rock passed over the lunar south pole before hitting, creating a huge basin and sending streams of boulders hurtling at a speed of nearly 1 mile a second (1 kilometer a second). The debris landed like missiles, digging out two canyons comparable in size to Arizona's Grand Canyon in barely 10 minutes. The latter, by comparison, took millions of years to form.",
      "\u201cThis was a very violent, a very dramatic geologic process,\u201d said lead author David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.",
      "Kring and his team estimate the asteroid was 15 miles (25 kilometers) across and that the energy needed to create these two canyons would have been more than 130 times that in the world\u2019s current inventory of nuclear weapons.",
      "Most of the ejected debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole, Kring said.",
      "That means NASA\u2019s targeted exploration zone around the pole mostly on the moon's near side won\u2019t be buried under debris, keeping older rocks from 4 billion plus years ago exposed for collection by moonwalkers.

    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\"",

    "story": [
      "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius) and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 degrees Celsius) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51.1 degrees Celsius) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \u201cBut we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres (1,779 hectares) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "Samoa\u2019s top health official has denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Samoa\u2019s top health official on Monday denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made during his bid to become U.S. health secretary, rejecting his claim that some who died in the country's 2019 measles epidemic didn't have the disease.",
      "\"We don\u2019t know what was killing them,\" Kennedy said during tense U.S. Senate hearings last week on whether he should oversee the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggesting that the cause of the 83 deaths \u2014 mostly of children under age 5 \u2014 was unclear.",
      "\"It's a total fabrication,\u201d Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told The Associated Press of Kennedy's comments.",
      "U.S. senators grilled Kennedy last week over his 2019 Samoa trip, accusing him of downplaying his role in the epidemic.",
      "The outbreak devastated the Pacific island nation in 2019, killing 83 people in a population of 200,000. Vaccination rates were historically low because of poor public health management and the 2018 deaths of two babies whose vaccines were incorrectly prepared, prompting fears that the MMR immunization was unsafe before the nature of the error was discovered.",
      "The government suspended vaccinations for 10 months before the outbreak \u2014 the period when Kennedy visited. His trip was organized by a Samoan anti-vaccine influencer, according to a 2021 blog post by Kennedy.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy denied that his visit had fueled anti-vaccine sentiment. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaxxers from New Zealand came to be with him here,\u201d Ekeroma said. \u201cThat's how I know that his influence can be far-reaching.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the tissue samples were sent to New Zealand, most of those people did not have measles,\u201d Kennedy told U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Ekeroma, a medical doctor who also holds a doctorate in health, said that the claim was a \u201chuge denial\u201d of the fact that doctors from several countries traveled to Samoa to treat measles patients.",
      "The Samoan official wasn't the health chief during the outbreak, but confirmed key details with his predecessor, he said. Only one autopsy was carried out and no postmortem tissue samples were sent abroad, which was not unusual because measles is a simple disease to diagnose, said Ekeroma.",
      "Blood samples from living patients were sent to Australia and New Zealand, where the public health agency said Monday that testing had confirmed the same strain of measles circulating in New Zealand at the time.",
      "\u201cI went there \u2013 nothing to do with vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa and make health delivery much more efficient.\u201d",
      "Ekeroma rejected that assertion, referring to social media posts by anti-vaccine advocates who posed for photos with Kennedy during his trip. One later wrote on the blog of Kennedy's then nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 which has decried MMR vaccines as unsafe \u2014 that during the outbreak he received advice from people assembled by Kennedy encouraging the alternative treatments he was supplying to Samoan families.",
      "In the same blog post, Kennedy recalled meeting Samoa's then prime minister, who he said was \u201ccurious to measure health outcomes following the \u2018natural experiment\u2019 created by the national respite from vaccines.\u201d",
      "In late 2019, Kennedy wrote to the leader, saying that the deaths could have been caused by a measles vaccine \u2014 statements he repeated in written responses to senators' questions following the hearing. He urged the Samoan leader to approach a particular laboratory to investigate the source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMy words had nothing to do with vaccine uptake in Samoa or with the 2019 epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in his written responses.",
      "But Kennedy emboldened anti-vaccine contacts in Samoa, Ekeroma said, and the epidemic was fueled by disinformation in social media posts in the island nation and abroad.",
      "Moelagi Leilani Jackson, a Samoan nurse who worked on the vaccination campaign, told the AP in 2023 that anti-vaccine campaigners \u201cgot louder\u201d after Kennedy\u2019s visit.",
      "\u201cI feel like they felt they had the support of Kennedy,\u201d she said.",
      "However, Ekeroma said that Kennedy's overtures weren't heeded by the nation\u2019s leaders. A vaccination campaign resumed in 2019 and measles vaccines are now compulsory for Samoan children.",
      "If Kennedy is affirmed as the top U.S. health official this week, it would be \u201ca danger to us, a danger to everyone,\u201d Ekeroma said. Kennedy would control U.S. funding for vaccination initiatives and could make affordable vaccines harder for small nations like Samoa to access, the official said.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be appointed, then we will have to actually discuss around the Pacific as to how we\u2019re going to try to neutralize his influence in the region,\u201d he added.",

      "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company designs and supplies the advanced computer chips that play an integral role in developing artificial intelligence.",
      "The meeting at the White House was confirmed by a person familiar who insisted on anonymity to discuss the conversation between Huang and Trump. The person said the meeting was set up weeks ago and would enable them to get acquainted and talk about AI policy. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to comment on the meeting.",
      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he might continue and harden Biden\u2019s approach.",
      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",
      "Trump said it was a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",
      "Countries such as Singapore, they added, should be subject to strict licensing requirements if they aren't willing to \u201ccrack down\u201d on China using their country as an intermediary for shipments.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nvidia said that its revenue associated with Singapore \"does not indicate diversion to China.\"",
      "\u201cOur public filings report \u2018bill to\u2019 not \u2018ship to\u2019 locations of our customers,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said. \u201cMany of our customers have business entities in Singapore and use those entities for products destined for the U.S. and the west. We insist that our partners comply with all applicable laws, and if we receive any information to the contrary, act accordingly.\u201d"

      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, noting the successful launch in a statement later Sunday, promised that his government will make further effort to \u201cmaximize\u201d the use of the navigation satellite system so that more people can smoothly access positioning data.",

      "House and Senate Republicans have been at odds for several months over whether to attempt to pass many of Trump\u2019s agenda items in one sweeping package or in two separate, smaller packages. Republicans hope to use a fast-track budget tool called reconciliation that would allow them to pass major budget-related measures without any Democratic support.",

      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman heard arguments Wednesday over a request by five pregnant undocumented women to block Trump's Day-1 executive order seeking to redefine the meaning of the 14th Amendment to exclude the children of undocumented immigrants from birthright citizenship.",
      "\"The denial of the precious right to citizenship will cause irreparable harm,\" Judge Boardman said in handing down her order. \"It has been said the right to U.S. citizenship is a right no less precious than life or liberty. If the court does not enjoin enforcement of the executive order, children subject to the order will be denied the rights and benefits of U.S. citizenship and their parents will face instability.\"",
      "\"A nationwide injunction is appropriate and necessary because it concerns citizenship,\" Judge Boardman said.",

      "In her ruling, Judge Boardman said Trump's executive order \"conflicts with the plain language of the 14th Amendment.\"",
      "\"The U.S. Supreme court has resoundingly rejected the president's interpretation of the citizenship clause,\" Boardman said. \"In fact, no court has endorsed the president's interpretation, and this court will not be the first.\"",

      "During the hearing, plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Mead called the DOJ's argument a \"reimagination of the 14th Amendment phrase 'subject jurisdiction.'\"",

      "Lawyers for the Department of Justice have claimed that Trump's executive order attempts to resolve \"prior misimpressions\" of the 14th Amendment, arguing that birthright citizenship creates a \"perverse incentive for illegal immigration.\" If permitted, Trump's executive order would preclude U.S. citizenship from the children of undocumented immigrants or immigrants whose presence in the United States is lawful but temporary.",
      "\"Text, history, and precedent support what common sense compels: the Constitution does not harbor a windfall clause granting American citizenship to, inter alia: the children of those who have circumvented (or outright defied) federal immigration laws,\" DOJ lawyers argued.",
      "The executive order had already been put on hold by U.S. District Judge John Coughenour in Seattle.",
      "\"I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar can state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It boggles my mind,\" said Coughenour last month when he issued his temporary restraining order. \"Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's offer to extend deferred resignations to the intelligence community poses a grave threat to U.S. national security interests, ex-officials say.",
    "story": [
      "The buyout offer has been met with \"frustration and anger\" inside the CIA.",
      "The Trump administration's offer to extend deferred resignations to members of the intelligence community as part of the federal buyouts being offered to trim the size of the government poses a grave threat to U.S. national security interests, lawmakers and former officials said Wednesday.",
      "Employees at the nation's foremost intelligence collection and analysis outfits -- including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Security Agency -- received email notices over the last week offering them the opportunity to leave their roles yet continue to be paid through September, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News.",
      "Unlike similar offers extended to employees at other federal agencies, U.S. officials said not all intelligence workers are eligible for the buyouts and certain resignations will be reviewed before a decision is made about whether they can be accepted.",
      "Nevertheless, the deferred resignation offers were met by many in the intelligence community with a mix of \"frustration and anger,\" said one former CIA officer who remains in contact with current administration officials. The former official said that \"their frustration comes from watching an illogical policy jeopardize the mission they've dedicated their careers to protecting.\"",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed that sentiment, telling ABC News in a statement that the buyouts \"serve only to hollow out the very agencies we call on to protect our national security and insult the men and women who have dedicated their lives to keeping Americans safe.\"",
      "A CIA spokesperson characterized the offers as being \"part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission.\"",
      "But former officials questioned whether the administration had fully considered the consequences of arbitrarily allowing highly trained intelligence officials to leave their posts.",
      "\"What capabilities are we going to lose? What is the plan to replace that capability when they walk out the door?\" asked Charles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser during Trump's first term. \"I do not think the administration is taking that loss seriously.\"",
      "Many roles in the intelligence community, particularly those in operations and analysis, require years of tradecraft, weapons, and language training.",
      "Darrell Blocker, an ABC News contributor and former CIA officer who oversaw the agency's storied training facility, said \"from the moment operations officers take the oath to the time they reach full performance\" can take up to eight years.",
      "\"Decisions being made today will have an impact on our national security over the next decade, based on the training cycle,\" Blocker said.",
      "Losing experienced intelligence analysts presents a different set of challenges. Brian O'Neill, a former CIA executive, said the buyouts would unequivocally undermine the intelligence community's substantial \"institutional knowledge.\"",
      "The senior officers and analysts most inclined to accept buyouts are high performers with the talent to pursue lucrative work in the private sector, O'Neill suggested. Conversely, the policy may lead lower performers with fewer job prospects to remain in their roles, he said.",
      "\"This policy reflects a misguided, shotgun approach that will gut the Agency's core expertise and stability,\" O'Neill said.",
      "Former officials also expressed alarm at reports Wednesday that the CIA had shared a list of all employees hired within the past two years with the White House Office of Management and Budget in compliance with Trump's executive order seeking to reduce the federal workforce.",
      "A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that the agency shared the first names and last initials of new employees over a nonclassified system, prompting scrutiny of what former officials called a potential counterintelligence risk. The email was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Andrew Bakaj, an attorney who once served in the intelligence community's office of inspector general, said the administration's actions \"underscore the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to sell out national security.\"",
      "\"Our adversaries abroad are celebrating these purges,\" Bakaj said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:25:47 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's improbable proposal for a U.S. takeover of Gaza prompted plenty of pushback and questions.",
    "story": [
      "\"It gets us away from thinking about the real problem,\" an expert told ABC News.",
      "The world was still reeling Wednesday from President Donald Trump's stunning proposal that the U.S. \"take over\" war-torn Gaza, clear the rubble and economically develop the area -- after the nearly 2 million Palestinians who live there were removed to other countries.",
      "His bombshell announcement  was met with immediate pushback from Arab states and generated countless questions. Many said it would violate international law by seizing a territory by force, and others said displacing its people could flatly constitute a war crime.",
      "\"My initial reaction is, it's illegal,\" Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told ABC News. \"That it is harkening back to the days of colonialism and forced population transfers, which we thought were over when the United States and others established the world order that we've seen since the end of World War II\" -- when the Geneva Conventions were adopted.",
      "\"This is a nonstarter to begin with,\" said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer now at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy.",
      "Trump revealed his idea during a joint news conference Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he had studied it for months and his decision to go forward wasn't something \"made lightly.\"",
      "He said he saw a \"long-term ownership position\" for the United States in Gaza and they'd \"make sure something really spectacular is done.\" He said the \"world's people\" would live in Gaza after, including Palestinians, though earlier in the day he said he'd support a permanent resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere. Despite that, the White House on Wednesday said the relocation would be \"temporary\" as the rebuild took place, though officials also say it could take 10 to 15 years to complete.",
      "Trump said he was open to the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Gaza to see it through -- \"if necessary,\" he said -- despite his \"America First\" campaign promise to keep the U.S. out of foreign wars and other entanglements.",
      "The White House on Wednesday made the case that Trump has not \"committed\" to putting the military on the ground there, but indicated he wouldn't rule it out entirely in order to maintain leverage in negotiations.",
      "\"President Trump is an outside-of-the-box thinker and a visionary leader who solves problems that many others, especially in this city, claim are unsolvable,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",
      "Leavitt, however, didn't provide many details of how exactly a U.S. takeover would play out. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tried to soften the impact in the face of widespread backlash, arguing Trump's gambit was \"not meant as hostile.\"",
      "Foreign policy experts who spoke with ABC News said it's unclear what Trump is hoping to accomplish.",
      "\"It's sort of puzzling to me because he definitely wants to have some sort of recognition for the Abraham Accords he did in 2020 but this is the exact opposite thing he should do if he wants to actually see progress in the Middle East. I think he lost yardage here,\" said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute.",
      "Arab states are either openly slamming Trump's comments or reiterating their belief the only path forward is a two-state solution.",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump's pitch represented a \"serious violation of international law.\" Hamas called on Trump to retract the statements.",
      "Jordan said King Abdullah II stressed \"the need to put a stop to settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians.\" Abdullah is set to meet with Trump in Washington next week.",
      "The U.S. has long pushed for a two-state solution, and Trump's national security adviser Michael Waltz told CBS News on Wednesday that Trump's comments on a takeover did not suggest an end to that decades-long goal.",
      "Waltz said he believed Trump's takeover proposal could spur diplomacy. \"It's going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions, if they don't like Mr. Trump's solutions,\" he said.",
      "CSIS expert Hall said a \"generous\" view of what Trump is trying to do is potentially push Jordan and Egypt to do more for Palestinian refugees, or aid Netanyahu as the Israeli leader faces a fragile political coalition with far-right members of his government who want to resume war.",
      "But others called it a distraction.",
      "\"What it does is it gets us away from thinking about the real problem, which is how we create law and order and stability in Gaza to allow reconstruction of infrastructure to begin,\" said Riedel. \"That's the real urgent priority.\"",
      "All of this is playing out amid a fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal that is in its first phase. Hamas said on Tuesday that negotiations have begun for the second phase of the deal.",
      "Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Trump's takeover plan could harden Hamas and \"diminishes the incentives for many parties to push it forward.\"",
      "The Middle East Institute's Katulis maintained that Hamas and Israel still have reason to move forward but Trump's proposal for U.S. control of Gaza is, at the very least, \"not helpful\" and \"distracts from the real issues.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:46:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs, an atmospheric scientist, to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
    "story": [
      "If confirmed, this will be Neil Jacobs' second stint leading NOAA.",
      "President Donald Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs, an atmospheric scientist, to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "If confirmed, this will be Jacobs' second stint leading the agency. Beginning in 2019, he served as its acting administrator until Trump left office at the end of his term in January 2021.",
      "Jacobs is remembered for the so-called \"Sharpiegate\" incident, a September 2019 controversy during which Trump, in an Oval Office press briefing, showed a map of Hurricane Dorian's forecast track that appeared to have been altered with a black pen to show the storm's track extended to include southern Alabama. Though the official storm track from the National Weather Service (NWS) did not have it hitting the state, Trump had inaccurately declared a few days earlier that it would.",
      "Shortly after Trump made the claim, NOAA issued a statement siding with Trump and admonishing the NWS for publicly saying that Alabama was not in danger from the storm.",
      "Dorian ultimately did not make landfall in the U.S. and stayed east of Florida.",
      "The NOAA Science Council subsequently investigated Jacobs, saying that he violated the organization's scientific integrity policy by issuing a statement supporting Trump's incorrect claim about Dorian's storm track as an official NOAA release.",
      "Jacobs is currently the chief science advisor for the community Unified Forecast System (UFS), part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's (UCAR) Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science at North Carolina State University.",
      "The UFS is an effort by the broad scientific community to develop a common, open-source modeling infrastructure that encourages collaboration and eases the transition from research to operations to improve NOAA's forecast models.",
      "Jacobs has long supported an open innovation approach and well-coordinated research efforts that are mutually beneficial to the public, private, and academic sectors. In 2021, he published an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, discussing his vision for the community UFS.",
      "Before serving as NOAA's acting director, Jacobs was the chief atmospheric scientist at Panasonic Avionics Corporation, where he directed the research and development of its aviation weather observing platforms and modeling programs.",
      "In a November 2024 podcast interview, Jacobs shared his views on the future of government agencies, like NOAA, and also weighed in on Project 2025, a playbook of controversial conservative policy proposals co-authored by many Trump allies and members of his first administration, organized by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and which includes recommendations to repeal and eliminate preventive climate change initiatives.",
      "\"Any time there's an administration or an election year, whether it's an incumbent or a new administration, you're always going to have these think tanks and groups pushing transition documents to the transition team saying, this is what you should do, you should read this,\" Jacobs said. \"The executive branch can't just come in and completely change something that's authorized in law.\"",
      "Jacobs also said that \"NOAA has all of these congressional mandates that are codified. Congress would have to rewrite a mountain of legislation to undo all that.\u201d",
      "Last month, Jacobs was recognized as a 2025 Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) during the organization's annual meeting. An AMS Fellow is a distinction reserved for those who have made \"outstanding contributions to the atmospheric or related oceanic or hydrologic sciences or their applications during a substantial period of years.\"",
      "Jacobs holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from the University of South Carolina, and master's and doctoral degrees in atmospheric science from North Carolina State University.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 16:24:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Transgender young adults and families with transgender youth have sued against an executive order from the Trump administration that restricts gender-affirming care.",
    "story": [
      "The executive order restricts gender-affirming care for trans people under 19.",
      "Transgender young adults and families with transgender youth filed a legal challenge Tuesday against an executive order from the Trump administration that restricts gender-affirming care for transgender people under 19.",
      "\u201cWhen the Tennessee Legislature passed a law that banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, I knew we had to leave the state so that my daughter could continue receiving the care she needs,\u201d said Kristen Chapman, the mother of 17-year-old plaintiff Willow, in a statement.",
      "The Virginia resident continued: \"We moved to Virginia in the summer of 2023, but struggled to find a provider that would accept our Medicaid insurance. As paying for her care out-of-pocket became prohibitively expensive, I tried for months to get an appointment at VCU, and I finally got an appointment for January 29, 2025. The day before our appointment, President Trump signed the executive order at issue in this case. The next day, just a few hours before our appointment, VCU told us they would not be able to provide Willow with care. I thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter. Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "Trump's order moves to withhold federal funding to medical institutions that provide such care -- including puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and surgeries -- calling on the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \"take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" The executive order does not appear to restrict these procedures for non-transgender people under 19.",
      "Trump's executive order states that \"it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"",
      "The lawsuit, PFLAG v. Trump, was filed by Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Maryland, and the law firms Hogan Lovells and Jenner & Block on behalf of on behalf of PFLAG National, GLMA, two transgender young adults and five transgender adolescents.",
      "Major national medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and more than 20 others argue that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, beneficial, and medically necessary.",
      "The complaint notes that \"for many transgender adolescents, the onset of puberty leading to physical changes in their bodies that are incongruent with their gender identities can cause extreme distress.\"",
      "It continued, \"Puberty-delaying medication allows transgender adolescents to pause these changes, thereby minimizing and potentially preventing the heightened gender dysphoria caused by the development of secondary sex characteristics incongruent with their gender identity.\"",
      "The executive order is the latest action from Trump that impacts the transgender community -- which is estimated to make up less than 1% of the population over the age of 13. Trump also recently signed executive orders restricting transgender participation in the military, ending federal legal recognition of transgender people, and restricting gender marker changes on federal documents.",
      "The Supreme Court is currently considering the landmark U.S. v. Skrmetti case, which challenges Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming puberty blockers and hormone therapy on the grounds that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by discriminating based on sex.",

      "\"He is throwing out big ideas. And if anybody thinks that all of these big ideas are going to be implemented to conclusion, they don't understand the process of disruption,\" Tillis said. \"Everybody is acting like Congress doesn't exist anymore. Many of the things he's thinking about will require Congressional approval to actually structurally change them.\"",
      "But when asked why the changes wouldn't then go through Congress, Tillis called that the \"old way of doing things.\"",
      "\"We've got oversight. If it goes too far, I'll be the first person to step up -- he went too far.\"",
      "Democrats pounced, continuing to sound the alarm and arguing that it's only a matter of time until congressional Republicans and Musk are at loggerheads.",
      "\"There's going to be a contest here of who's really in charge,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said. \"Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, the idea that you can go back to last year's appropriations and just shut it down cold, without any recourse, is wrong.\"",
      "In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor Monday evening, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, called DOGE's actions \"flatly illegal\" and raised questions about whether the U.S. truly believes in the rule of law.",
      "\"I've got agencies I don't like \u2026 agencies that I think are spending too much money or too little money. Do you know what I do about that? I introduce a bill to change that because I believe in the American system of government,\" Schatz said.",
      "While speaking on the floor, Schatz got passionate, raising his voice and pounding his fist on the lectern as he expressed frustration about the situation unfolding. He also suggested that the move to unilaterally act without notifying Congress, in violation of congressional appropriation, was unAmerican.",
      "Schatz questioned why assessments of efficacy could not be made while aid work continues.",
      "\"People are dying now,\" he emphasized, arguing that changes could be made \"while you keep the agency open.\"",
      "\"What they did is they stormed into the offices of a federal building, sent everybody home, broke into the secure conference facilities, broke into the SCIFs, locked people out of their emails. Does that sound like the United States of America?\" Schatz added, painting a picture of what occurred at the USAID offices over the weekend. \"It really honestly does not sound like the United States of America to me. These people were not elected.\"",
      "Schatz's speech came after the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch, blocked an effort by Coons that asserted the belief that USAID is \"essential for advancing the national security interests of the United States.\"",
      "\"I'm supportive of the Trump administration's efforts to reform and restructure the agency in a way that better serves United States national security interests,\" Risch said.",
      "In a fiery press conference Monday, Senate Democrats said they were \"pulling the fire alarm\" to warn about the dangers posed by DOGE and Elon Musk's access to the Treasury's payments system.",
      "\"Before our very eyes, an unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government,\" Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.",

      "Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, has died",
      "Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, a decorated World War II pilot who broke racial barriers as a Tuskegee Airmen and earned honors for his combat heroism, has died. He was 100.",
      "Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed 332nd Fighter Group also known as the Tuskegee Airmen. The group were the nation\u2019s first Black military pilots.",
      "The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death. The organization said he passed peacefully at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on Sunday.",
      "Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be recognized until decades later.",
      "\u201cHarry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long after fighting for our country in World War II,\u201d Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said.",
      "Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his life titled \u201cSoaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen\u2019s Firsthand Account of World War II.\u201d In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips of their P-51 Mustangs.",
      "\u201cI did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up to my duty,\u201d Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN about the war.",
      "Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups.",
      "\u201cI got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling of belonging to something that was really big,\u201d Stewart said in a 2020 interview with WAMC.",
      "Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his book.",
      "Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a mechanical engineering degree New York University. He relocated to Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline company.",
      "Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the aircraft.",
      "\u201cWhen I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to my eyes is that they were both female,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "The Air Force last month briefly removed training course s with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash."

      "Next-door neighbors lost their near-identical homes in a California wildfire, but how they are navigating rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, a stark reflection of the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\u201cI chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\u201d said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they\u2019ll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\u201cIt changes the whole trajectory to your life,\u201d said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin\u2019s home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can\u2019t get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.\u2019\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \u201cdifficult but purposeful business decisions\u201d in California.",
      "Mercury didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson\u2019s case, and noted that it\u2019s difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn\u2019t cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\u201cBeing able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\u201d Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\u201cHalf the time, I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\u201cI could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It\u2019s just luck, really. It\u2019s nothing I did or didn\u2019t do,\u201d Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \u201cI had the same risk factors as everyone else.\u201d",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all trying to manage their exposure,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIf you think about wildfires, you don\u2019t want concentrated exposure.\u201d",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn\u2019t get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that\u2019s very, very painful,\u201d said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \u201cdone everything the insurers asked California to do\u201d but yielded little success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we\u2019re not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of risk in the system and there\u2019s a big question of who is going to pay for this,\u201d Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he\u2019ll have to take out loans to rebuild. He\u2019s considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can\u2019t fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he\u2019s thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cStuck paying for an insurance that doesn\u2019t cover anything. You don\u2019t want to live in a risky area. You don\u2019t have the safety net.\u201d",

      "Nurses caring for military veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs comprise the largest group of federal employees",
      "For the federal government's largest group of employees \u2014 nurses caring for military veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2014 the Trump administration's deferred resignation offer and its looming Thursday deadline come amid longstanding staffing shortages, deemed severe at more than half of all facilities.",
      "Unions are discouraging nurses from accepting the offer, and leaders say an exodus would directly and immediately affect the care of its 9.1 million enrolled veterans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already facing a staffing crisis in our hospitals,\u201d said Irma Westmoreland, a registered nurse who heads the Veterans Affairs unit for National Nurses United. \u201cWe cannot afford to lose any more staff.\u201d",
      "Nurses for the VA \u2014 the federal government's largest employer \u2014 comprise the biggest single group of federal workers, numbering more than 100,000 and accounting for 5% of all full-time permanent employees, according to an Associated Press analysis of personnel data.",
      "Union official Mary-Jean Burke said she's taken calls from nurses and other VA workers from across the country. At first, she said, some thought the buyout plan sounded attractive, but second thoughts have set in.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I think people were like, \u2018I\u2019m out of here,\u2019\u201d said Burke, a physical therapist and American Federation of Government Employees leader. As more information came from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, it started sounding \u201ca little bit too good to be true and people were hesitant.\"",
      "VA nurses are somewhat older than the rest of the workforce, with 16.2% of nurses 55 and older, compared with 14.6% for the rest of the federal workforce, AP's analysis shows.",
      "Burke said some workers who are retirement eligible have been \u201con the fence\u201d about the offer, which promises pay through Sept. 30, though there have been broad concerns about the program's legality.",
      "Nurses were confused at first, and now they\u2019re angry, Westmoreland said.",
      "Official communication on the offer has implied the nurses are not productive, she said, and that's insulted those she\u2019s talked to. A follow-up question-and-answer email from the Office of Personnel Management encouraged federal employees to find a job in the private sector.",
      "\u201cThe way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector,\u201d the email said.",
      "Burke she's been asked by workers about the flurry of other executive orders, too.",
      "\u201cI can tell you here in Indiana and other places, people are really frightened about the chaos, the chaos they kind of feel around them,\u201d Burke said.",
      "The department's leadership also has expressed concern about the potential impact on nursing in the VA, she said. More than 80% of facilities are experiencing a severe nursing shortage, according to a 2024 report from the VA Office of Inspector General.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re scared, too,\u201d she said. \"They know that they have to follow the president\u2019s orders, per se, but then you hear the caveat, like, \u2018Hey, if five nurses take the buyout, we don\u2019t have an OR anymore.\u2019 That\u2019s in the dialogue of conversation.\u201d",
      "The VA did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Burke said she is worried about the federal workforce more broadly.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s going to look different,\" she said. \"A lot of people are stressed out because they kind of feel like the predictability of their mission is a little bit different.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "North Carolina Republicans have unveiled their initial attempt this year to boost recovery funding for Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican lawmakers on Wednesday unveiled their initial attempt this year to boost recovery funding for Hurricane Helene's historic flooding, proposing new spending that totals less than half of what new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein requested this week.",
      "A House committee reviewed but did not vote on the $500 million spending proposal, which would include money for some of the programs Stein sought funding for in his request Monday for $1.07 billion in new recovery spending.",
      "Last fall, the state legislature appropriated well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts. A couple of hundred million additional dollars previously earmarked for relief purposes would help pay for the packages from Stein and House Republicans.",
      "GOP legislative leaders and Stein have made enacting a funding bill early in the General Assembly session \u2014 rather than waiting until the traditional state government budget that takes effect July 1 gets negotiated \u2014 a top priority. Stein and lawmakers will seek more recovery funds this year.",
      "\u201cWe know that no matter what appropriation we\u2019re able to do, it\u2019s never going to be enough,\u201d Rep. John Bell of Wayne County, a co-chair of the House Helene recovery committee, told colleagues. \u201cBut this is a starting point, with multiple bills after this to follow.\u201d",
      "The competing proposals both include $150 million to kickstart a home reconstruction and repair program in the mountains while they await federal funds for the same purpose to aririve. And they both contain money \u2014 albeit in different amounts \u2014 to help farmers and to rebuild private roads and bridges.",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. State officials projected the late September storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Bell told reporters that the $500 million figure could rise as Senate counterparts get involved in negotiations later. But he said the House would act strategically to maximize federal matching funds and to ensure the state doesn't repeat errors from previous hurricane recovery efforts.",
      "Bell cited the program developed in the preceding administration of Gov. Roy Cooper to rebuild homes after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018. The program still needs $217 million to finish construction on more than 1,100 eastern North Carolina homes.",
      "Committee co-chair Rep. Dudley Greene of Avery County, who suffered property damage from Helene, said that western North Carolina still doesn\u2019t know for sure what money will be made available for repairs and how it will be distributed.",
      "\u201cHopefully, this is a first step in trying to alleviate some of that confusion,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Creating a consensus plan will pose an early test of Stein\u2019s relationship with Republican lawmakers, who control the legislature but narrowly lack a veto-proof majority following the November elections.",
      "The House committee was expected to consider amendments next week, with a floor vote soon after. Senate Republicans filed their own placeholder disaster relief bill on Wednesday.",
      "The House bill omits entirely Stein's request for $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses and or physical damages.",
      "Many Republicans previously have expressed reservations about the state providing direct grants to businesses, rather than loans. Bell told reporters that a grant program could surface later in the bill process.",
      "The House package also does not contain Stein's $100 million request to recompense local governments in the mountains for lost or spent revenues nor his $34 million appeal to provide summer school in public school districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene\u2019s rampage.",
      "Stein said this week that funds are needed now to prevent more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind academically."

      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of miles from Elon Musk\u2019s office in the White House complex, a federal worker based in the Pacific Northwest is wondering whether to quit.",
      "Musk, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most powerful advisers, has orchestrated an unprecedented financial incentive for people to leave their government jobs, promising several months of pay in return for their resignation. The worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, wants to take the money and move overseas.",
      "But she\u2019s worried. What if the offer is too good to be true? What if this is really a covert effort to make a list of disloyal government employees?",
      "Her situation is a microcosm of the uncertainty sweeping through the federal government, which is the country\u2019s single largest employer. More than 2 million workers \u2014 analysts, nurses, scientists, accountants, food inspectors and loan processors \u2014 face a deadline of 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday to decide if they should leave.",
      "The deferred resignation program is part of Trump\u2019s plan to remake the federal government, weakening what allies describe as the \u201cdeep state\u201d that undermined the Republican president during his first term. Administration officials said they can save taxpayer money by presenting employees with \u201ca valuable, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the administration ramped up its pressure on employees to leave, sending a reminder that layoffs or furloughs could come next.",
      "\u201cThe majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,\u201d said the message from the Office of Personnel Management, which has been a nexus of Musk's efforts to downsize the government.",
      "The email said anyone who remains will be expected to be \u201cloyal\u201d and \u201cwill be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward.\u201d Some employees could be reclassified to limit civil service protections as well.",
      "\u201cEmployees who engage in unlawful behavior or other misconduct will be prioritized for appropriate investigation and discipline, including termination,\u201d the email said.",
      "Democrats said workers shouldn't accept the deferred resignation program because it wasn't authorized by Congress, raising the risk they won't get paid. Unions have sued to stop Trump's plans, and a judge will consider whether to block the buyout offer at a hearing Thursday afternoon in Boston.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scam and not a buyout,\u201d said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "Kelley said he tells workers that \u201cif it was me, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "An employee at the Department of Education, who also spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said the administration appeared desperate to get people to sign the agreement. However, she said there were too many red flags, such as a clause waiving the right to sue if the government failed to honor its side of the deal.",
      "Trump put Musk, the world's richest man, in charge of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is a sweeping initiative to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. The original email offering the deferred resignation program was titled \u201cFork in the road,\u201d echoing a similar message that Musk sent Twitter employees two years ago after he bought the social media platform.",
      "Trump administration officials have organized question-and-answer sessions with employees as the deadline approaches.",
      "Rachel Oglesby, the chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Education who previously worked at the America First Policy Institute, said Trump is trying to reduce the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cI know there\u2019s been a lot of questions out there about whether it\u2019s real and whether it\u2019s a trick,\u201d she said, according to a recording obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cAnd it\u2019s exactly what it looks like. It\u2019s one of the many tools that he\u2019s using to try to achieve the campaign promise to bring reform to the civil service and changes to D.C.\u201d",
      "The issue was also discussed during a meeting with Department of Agriculture employees, according to another recording obtained by the AP. Marlon Taubenheim, a human resources official, acknowledged that \u201cthese are very trying times\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of stress.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacqueline Ponti-Lazaruk, another agency leader, said employees \u201cprobably didn\u2019t have the runway of time that you might have liked to make a life-changing decision.\u201d",
      "For those who remain, she said, \"we\u2019ll just keep plugging along.\u201d",
      "Assurances from administration officials have not alleviated concerns across a range of agencies. Some federal workers said they did not trust the validity of the offers, doubting that Trump has the authority to disburse money. Others point to his record of stiffing contractors as a New York real estate mogul.",
      "Scattered protests have sprung up outside federal buildings, including on Tuesday at the Office of Personnel Management.",

      "Government jobs have often been considered secure positions, but O\u2019Hara said there\u2019s fear in the workforce. The sense from his colleagues is \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be here tomorrow because, like, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201d",

      "Mary-Jean Burke, a physical therapist for the Department of Veterans Affairs in Indianapolis, said she's worried that too many people will leave, jeopardizing health care services.",
      "Burke, who also serves as a union official, said doubts have also been growing over whether to take the offer.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I think people were like, \u2018I\u2019m out of here,'\" she said. But then they saw a social media post from DOGE, which said employees can \"take the vacation you always wanted, or just watch movies and chill, while receiving your full government pay and benefits.\u201d",
      "The message backfired because \"that kind of thing sounded a little bit too good to be true and people were hesitant,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Either way, she said, Trump has achieved his apparent goal of shaking up the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cEvery day, it\u2019s something,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIf he signed up to be a disrupter, he\u2019s doing it.\u201d",

      "Congress is proving little match for the Department of Government Efficiency as wary lawmakers watch it march through the bureaucracy",
      "WASHINGTON -- When Elon Musk debuted the Department of Government Efficiency recently at the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson enthusiastically predicted the coming Trump administration would bring \u201ca lot of change around here.\u201d",
      "Three weeks in, the change the Trump administration has brought is a disruption of the federal government on an unprecedented scale, dismantling longstanding programs, sparking widespread public outcry and challenging the very role of Congress to create the nation\u2019s laws and pay its bills.",
      "Government workers are being pushed to resign. Entire agencies are being shuttered. Federal funding to states and nonprofits was temporarily frozen. And the most sensitive Treasury Department information of countless Americans was opened to Musk\u2019s DOGE team in an unprecedented breach of privacy and protocol.",
      "\u201cThis is an erosion of our democracy,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a longtime economic adviser to conservative Republicans, now at the Manhattan Institute think tank.",
      "President Donald Trump has tapped Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, to take on inner workings of the world\u2019s oldest democracy, and so far the results are stunning, if not alarming and unlawful, being challenged in dozens of court cases nationwide.",
      "Congress is proving little match for DOGE as wary lawmakers watch it march through the bureaucracy. Instead, a rush of lawsuits is demanding interventions to stop the Republican president's team from unilaterally gutting government. And protests are erupting outside government agencies and clogging the congressional phone lines.",
      "\u201cWhatever DOGE is doing, it is certainly not \u2014 not \u2014 what democracy looks like or has ever looked like in the grand history of this country,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.",
      "\"An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government,\u201d Schumer posted on Musk's social media site X.",
      "Musk responded on his platform: \u201cHysterical reactions like this is how you know that DOGE is doing work that really matters.\u201d",
      "Congress has been here before, tested during Trump\u2019s first term by his willingness to break the norms and skirt the outer banks of legality, most notably when he steamrolled Congress and poached federal military housing and construction funds to build parts of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "But Trump\u2019s second-term partnership with Musk, who spent some $200 million on Trump's White House bid and employs the tech world ethos of moving fast and breaking things, is escalating the confrontation. On a stated quest to save money by rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, they are making moves to upend American institutions, decimate the civil service and leave a reformed \u2014 or hollowed-out \u2014 federal government in its place.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said it would be \u201ccatastrophic to our system of government\u201d if the effort succeeds.",
      "\u201cMany of the things they are doing are brazenly unlawful, and we\u2019ve seen that the courts have been willing to intervene \u2014 and intervene quickly,\u201d Parrott said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real readiness and understanding of the stakes.\u201d",
      "In many ways, Trump is pursuing by force what Republicans have long promised but have been unable to deliver by congressional action: shrinking the size and scope of the federal government. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist quipped more than a decade ago about the goal of making government small enough to drown in a bathtub.",
      "But facing pushback from within their ranks about cutting programs Americans rely upon, Republicans have repeatedly failed to accomplish their budget-slashing goals even when they fully control Congress and the White House, as they do now.",
      "While Congress has the power to pass legislation to fund government operations, the president can veto bills or sign them into law. Instead, Trump is testing an idea championed by his nominee for budget director, Russ Vought, that the executive has the ability to \u201cimpound\u201d federal funds, clawing the money back.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said DOGE provides \u201ccover\u201d for some Republicans who want to cut federal funds, when Congress has failed to do so.",
      "And other Republicans say they are comfortable with Trump's pause of certain federal operations, particularly the U.S. Agency for International Development, which sends aid around the world. Closing the Department of Education is next on deck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got oversight,\u201d said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. \u201cIf he goes too far, I\u2019ll be the first person to step up.\u201d",
      "Taken together the actions of the administration and DOGE have been swift, relentless and wide open to debate.",
      "Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget's move to abruptly freeze federal grants and loans drew outrage nationwide as states and nonprofit organizations feared being locked out of funds they need to provide housing, health care and other services. A day later, the White House reversed course.",
      "The shutdown of funds to USAID is largely seen as a test case for the Impoundment Control Act, which Vought has discussed using as a way to roll back congressionally approved funding. Vought's nomination is on track for Senate confirmation this week, despite all Senate Democrats saying they will oppose him.",
      "And DOGE dipped into the inner-workings of the Treasury Department to access its payment system \u2014 and the private information of millions of Americans \u2014 in what is widely viewed as a way for the White House to eventually stop federal funds to various entities.",
      "On Monday, U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan said the administration's actions with the federal funding \u201cpotentially run roughshod over a \u2018bulwark of the Constitution\u2019 by interfering with Congress\u2019s appropriation of federal funds.\u201d",
      "\u201cDefendants\u2019 actions appear to suffer from infirmities of a constitutional magnitude,\" she wrote, extending an order issued last week that had paused OMB's sweeping funding freeze. \u201cThe appropriation of the government\u2019s resources is reserved for Congress, not the Executive Branch. And a wealth of legal authority supports this fundamental separation of powers.\u201d",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said what gives her pause now is how Congress moves forward with legislation to fund the government by the upcoming March 14 deadline.",
      "\u201cWhat if we do all that and come to an agreement ... vote it in \u2014 and this administration says, 'That's bunk. We don't have to go by that,'\u201d she said. \u201cSo the level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here.\u201d",
      "Asked if the administration could do what it's doing, Johnson, the speaker, insisted, \"There will be an appropriate action for Congress to take, but we haven\u2019t yet sorted out what\u2019s happening with it.\u201d",
      "Pressed if Trump had the authority to shut agencies, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt sounded like a missile was firing bullets, metal at my car, everyone else\u2019s car,\u201d Andre Howard told WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. Howard said he immediately backed up his car while his son covered his sister and told her, \u201cGet down!\u201d Trey grabbed his sister and Howard heard the glass shatter, he said.",
      "\u201dI turn around \u2014 there\u2019s a piece of metal sticking out of my son\u2019s head from the plane,\" Howard said.",
      "Andre Howard said he used socks and another man provided his shirt in an attempt to stop the bleeding on the boy's head. A police officer rushed them to the hospital. Doctors warned the family he might not survive his injuries, but he has improved every day.",
      "He woke from surgery and almost immediately asked about his sister \u2014 after his father assured him that he hadn't missed the Super Bowl game between his favorite team, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Kansas City Chiefs, Howard said.",
      "The crash Friday evening killed all six people on the Learjet 55 air ambulance, including a girl who had been receiving medical treatment at Shriners Children\u2019s Philadelphia hospital. A seventh person inside a vehicle was killed on the ground, while 24 people on the ground were injured. Officials have repeatedly said the number of casualties may change as the investigation continues.",

      "CIA employees have gotten letters offering them buyouts if they voluntarily resign",
      "WASHINGTON -- The CIA confirmed on Wednesday that it has offered buyouts to employees who voluntarily resign, the latest group of workers targeted in President Donald Trump's push to transform the federal government.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to say how many people received offers or whether they face any deadline to decide.",
      "Trump's Office of Personnel Managemen t already has offered millions of federal workers about eight months of salary if they agree by Thursday to leave their jobs. The CIA and other national security agencies were initially exempted, but the CIA offers suggest few corners of the government will escape Trump's overhaul.",
      "Trump has long criticized America's intelligence agencies, and his new CIA director, John Ratcliffe, has promised big changes, claiming the CIA has strayed from its original focus on human-collected intelligence.",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, the CIA said the buyout offers are part of an effort by Ratcliffe to move swiftly \"to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the Administration\u2019s national security priorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission,\" the agency said about the buyouts, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Since taking office last month Trump has launched an attempt to gut and reshape several federal agencies, most notably the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been largely dismantled by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, the leader of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "National security experts have warned that deep cuts to the CIA and other agencies could put lives at risk by hampering their mission or reducing the flow of intelligence between the U.S. and its allies. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged CIA employees to carefully weigh the offer.",
      "\u201cThere are few government agencies more essential to our national security than the CIA,\u201d Warner said in a statement. \"A lot of federal employees, including at the CIA, are my constituents, and I\u2019ve been warning them that these \u2018buyouts\u2019 are empty promises, since Congress hasn\u2019t approved any money to do it. I\u2019d hate to see people resign and then get stiffed like the contractors on President Trump\u2019s construction projects.\u201d",
      "Though the precise number is classified, the CIA employs thousands of people engaged in the collection and analysis of foreign intelligence, both at its headquarters in Virginia as well as overseas postings.",
      "Ratcliffe told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in January that the CIA must do a better job of harnessing technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing while also expanding the agency\u2019s use of human intelligence collection.",
      "\"We\u2019re not where we\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d Ratcliffe said as senators considered his nomination."

      "Conservatives\u2019 nationwide offensive against transgender care is increasing trying to cut off care for transgender adults, and a panel of Georgia lawmakers has become the first in 2025 to move forward",
      "ATLANTA -- Conservatives\u2019 nationwide offensive against transgender care, earlier focused on young people, is increasingly trying to cut off access for transgender adults.",
      "With 2025 state legislative sessions still young, bills have been introduced to cut off public funding for gender affirming care for adults in at least 10 states. Georgia became the first state to move forward this year, with a panel voting 6-3 Tuesday to advance a bill to the full Senate despite pleas from public employees who would lose insurance benefits.",
      "\u201cIt is a slap in the face to reward that service by stripping us of the health care access that we desperately need,\u201d said Carrie Scott, a lawyer for the state and transgender woman.",
      "The panel voted hours after a Georgia county asked an appeals court to overturn an order to pay for gender affirming care for a sheriff\u2019s deputy.",
      "Other states have already tried to restrict care for transgender adults. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed a bill last year that would have banned Medicaid spending on some gender affirming care. Former Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, tried to impose restrictions on adult care before his executive order was rolled back. And a 2023 Florida law requires physicians to oversee health care related to transitioning, mandating in-person appointments.",
      "This year, bills have been introduced not only in Georgia, but Arizona, Connecticut, Kentucky, Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia.",
      "LGBTQ+ advocates say Republican legislators are emboldened by President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting transgender and nonbinary people. Former President Joe Biden, by contrast, supported transgender rights.",
      "Carl Charles, an attorney for gay rights group Lambda Legal, said Trump\u2019s actions are \u201cmarching orders\u201d to Republican legislators.",
      "\u201cCertainly the states are feeling emboldened by the maelstrom of Trump\u2019s anti-trans orders from the White House,\u201d Charles said.",
      "The Georgia bill would ban spending state money on gender affirming care through state employee health plans, Medicaid and prisons.",
      "\u201cWhat this bill says is we are not going to spend state taxpayer dollars on transgender surgeries in our state,\" Republican Sen. Blake Tillery of Vidalia, the sponsor, told the Senate Insurance and Labor Committee.",
      "Earlier Tuesday in a nearby courtroom, Houston County Sheriff's Sgt. Anna Lange watched as lawyers clashed before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals over whether her county\u2019s insurance plan must keep paying gender affirming care benefits she won through a federal suit.",
      "\u201cTrans people are people, and we deserve to be treated just like everybody else,\u201d Lange said afterward.",
      "Like Lange, Georgia state employees sued for benefits, with advocates winning settlements covering public university employees, Medicaid beneficiaries and state employees.",
      "Scott and Khara Hayden, a transgender woman who is an information technology specialist, both testified they might leave state employment if benefits end on Jan. 1, 2026, as the bill proposes.",
      "\u201cIf you approve this bill, essentially you\u2019re going to take away the care I need to continue living,\" Hayden testified, saying a lack of hormone therapy would force her into early menopause.",
      "The bill may have trouble passing the Georgia House, though.",
      "State House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, repeated again Tuesday that the only transgender-related legislation he backs this year is a bill to ban transgender girls and women from playing school and college sports. He said he foresees a \u201cvery narrow focus\u201d on that measure.",
      "The health bill explicitly blames Republican Attorney General Chris Carr for settling the state employees\u2019 lawsuit in 2023. Tillery, the bill\u2019s sponsor, is an ally of Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who is expected to run for governor in 2026 against Carr.",
      "Carr has rejected the idea that he favors benefits for transgender people, with spokesperson Kara Murray saying he has a \u201clong track record\u201d of opposing them.",
      "The state and employees who litigated for benefits are divided on whether a new law could reverse legal settlements. Plaintiffs say they made binding contracts, which includes a provision saying the state won\u2019t reimpose the prohibition. But Tillery argues each year is a new health insurance contract and the state can change the terms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our proper duty to write the law and it\u2019s the court\u2019s duty to interpret that law,\" Tillery said.",
      "Even if the state can scrap the settlements, opponents say they'd sue again to strike down unconstitutional denial of benefits to transgender people because of their sex. The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that under a 1964 civil rights law, employers couldn't discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender employees \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s discriminatory, 100%, that they\u2019re specifically targeting the transgender individuals and the care that they need,\u201d Hayden said."

      "The Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 to deny recommending clemency for Wendell Grissom, 57, who turned down an opportunity to speak to the board via a video link from the State Penitentiary in McAlester. He is scheduled to die by lethal injection on March 20.",
      "Grissom and a co-defendant, Jessie Floyd Johns, were convicted of killing of Amber Matthews, 23, and wounding her friend, Dreu Kopf, at Kopf's Blaine County residence. Johns was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",
      "Grissom's attorneys, federal public defenders Kristi Christopher and Thomas Hird, did not dispute Grissom\u2019s guilt, but argued that he suffered from brain damage that was never presented to a jury. They also told the board Grissom has always accepted responsibility and expressed remorse for Matthews' killing, even writing an apology to the woman's family during his first interview with police.",
      "\u201cHe cannot change the past, but he is now and always has been deeply ashamed and remorseful,\u201d Christopher said.",
      "Grissom's attorneys also said they have spoken to several jurors in the case, including the jury foreman, who said they likely would not have voted for the death penalty if they knew about Grissom's brain damage.",

      "\u201cI lived in a heightened state of fear at all times,\u201d she said tearfully.",
      "Without a clemency recommendation from the board, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt cannot commute Grissom's death sentence. Stitt has granted clemency only once in his six years in office, in 2021, to death row inmate Julius Jones, commuting his sentence to life without parole just hours before Jones was scheduled to receive a lethal injection. Stitt has denied clemency recommendations from the board in four other cases."

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore says his state must become less reliant on federal jobs and better develop other economic strengths",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, facing budget problems and President Donald Trump\u2019s dramatic efforts to downsize a federal workforce crucial to Maryland's economy, said the state must become less reliant on federal jobs and better develop other economic strengths, during a speech to state lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Moore, a Democrat mentioned as a rising star in the party and a potential future presidential candidate, described both the state's $3 billion budget deficit and the new administration's first actions as \u201ctwo storms\u201d that have made landfall.",
      "\u201cWe are being tested by an historic fiscal challenge \u2014 the likes that we haven\u2019t seen since the Great Recession \u2014 and if that wasn\u2019t enough, we are now being tested by a new administration in Washington that sows uncertainty and confusion, and chaos,\u201d Moore said.",
      "The Republican president's first weeks back in office have jolted heavily Democratic Maryland by decreeing a federal hiring freeze and proposing a widespread buyout plan that encourages federal workers to quit. There also were confusing executive orders, including one that abruptly froze and then unfroze federal grant funds, as well as other broad changes to the federal government sending shockwaves into a state that neighbors the nation's capital.",
      "\u201cThese ideological moves will have the distinct impact on hurting our middle class, which is already feeling the pinch of inflation,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd in a larger sense, and heartbreakingly, these actions mark a shift in a longstanding relationship and longstanding norms between Washington and Maryland \u2014 norms that have been preserved by leaders of both political parties and of all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore, who was mentioned as a possible replacement for then-President Joe Biden last year when he withdrew his reelection bid, said he still hopes to work with the new administration and Republican-led Congress to \u201cdeepen the partnership between Maryland and Washington, D.C., that has benefited our people all across the country for generations and across political ideologies.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut if the policy decisions of these past few weeks are any preview, I fear that our most charitable expectations will be met with harsh realities \u2014 that at a time when our nation needs clarity, we confront chaos,\" the governor said.",
      "\u201cAt a time when our nation needs vision, we confront hysteria,\" Moore added.",
      "Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia have about 20% of the nation\u2019s federal workers. Federal employees represent about 5.7% of Maryland's total employment, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to a 2024 report by Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman's office.",
      "The federal government also supports an ecosystem of private sector suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors in Maryland. Federal procurement provided a $42 billion investment in Maryland businesses in 2022, which represented 10% of the state\u2019s GDP, the report says.",
      "The governor said he has identified \u201cthree lighthouse industries of the future\u201d that he wants to focus on in Maryland, including life sciences, information technology and aerospace and defense.",
      "The governor said the state must close its budget gap in a way that grows the middle class, \u201csupercharges and diversifies our economy\u201d and \u201cbreaks our distinct reliance on Washington.\u201d",
      "Maryland Republicans said the state is underachieving, but not for the reasons mentioned by the governor.",
      "\u201cMaryland families are struggling with their finances, energy costs, higher prices and more because of the expensive policies and overregulation passed by a Democratic Supermajority \u2014 not because of his predecessor or new leadership in Washington,\u201d said state Sen. Steve Hershey, the Maryland Senate minority leader.",
      "Moore has proposed a budget for the next fiscal year that includes higher income tax rates for taxpayers who make $500,000 or more, as well as about $2 billion in spending reductions throughout state government to address a $3 billion deficit. The proposal would create a new 6.25% tax rate for people who make more than $500,000 and a 6.5% rate for taxpayers who make more than $1 million.",
      "For incomes over $350,000, an additional 1% tax would be levied on profits from the sale of stocks and other assets. The governor says 82% of Marylanders will either see a tax cut or no change. He's also proposing a reduction to the state's corporate tax rate."

      "WASHINGTON -- The federal office that enforces civil rights at schools across the U.S. has been ordered to prioritize complaints of antisemitism above all else as it molds to President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, raising fears that other rights violations will go unpunished.",
      "Trump\u2019s new leader of the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights told staff this week they will be expected to aggressively pursue complaints involving antisemitism and hew closely to Trump\u2019s wishes, according to sources who were on the call with Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights.",
      "Already there are signs of a hard turn on civil rights enforcement, including new actions focused squarely on anti-Jewish bias and transgender issues.",
      "Responding to a White House order last week, the office launched new antisemitism investigations at five universities including Columbia and Northwestern. Days earlier, it opened an inquiry into Denver public schools over an all-gender bathroom that replaced a girls\u2019 bathroom while leaving another one exclusive to boys. On Wednesday, Trump ordered schools that receive federal money to ban transgender girls from participating in women's sports, promising the Education Department would investigate schools and colleges that don't comply.",
      "The office\u2019s fleet of lawyers have mostly been sidelined while the new administration shifts priorities. Daily work has been frozen, which is typical when a new president takes office, but sources say there\u2019s a new blackout on communication with schools, colleges or those submitting complaints. Questions about how to enforce Title IX go unanswered, leaving schools in the dark as they navigate a new memo from the agency last week.",
      "The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "In the staff call, Trainor said the office must be more aggressive and faster than it was under former President Joe Biden. He accused the previous administration of neglecting its duty to fight antisemitism, leaving more than 100 cases open. Trump has called for a review of all antisemitism cases opened since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, including those resolved under Biden.",
      "With a rigid focus on antisemitism and gender identity, there\u2019s fear the office won\u2019t give adequate attention to racial discrimination, mistreatment based on disability, or Islamophobia. The office is required to process all complaints it fields, but politics can play a role in setting priorities and choosing which cases to pursue.",
      "Raymond Pierce, who led the office under Democratic President Bill Clinton, said focusing on antisemitism alone doesn\u2019t fulfill the mission of the office \u2014 to enforce civil rights laws.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism is an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Civil Rights Act is broader than just religion.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Trainor promised his office \u201cwill vigorously investigate all alleged violations of civil rights laws within its purview.\u201d",
      "Trainor had also warned staff of a coming \u201crestructuring\u201d and acknowledged that Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency is examining the Education Department. It raised worries about staffing cuts in a civil rights office that has seen dwindling numbers even as it received a record 22,687 complaints last year.",
      "Additionally, there\u2019s concern Trump in his quest to shut down the Education Department will slash the office\u2019s budget and move it to the Justice Department, as suggested in the Project 2025 blueprint created by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s changes are most likely to be felt by Black students and those who are disabled, according to lawyers and advocates. For decades, the Office for Civil Rights has worked to force equal access for marginalized students, said Derek W. Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.",
      "If the office finds merit in a complaint, it has the power to withhold federal funding until schools or states comply.",
      "\u201cAre there local and state officials who want to do right by kids? Of course, there are,\u201d Black said. \u201cBut are there districts that don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal or don\u2019t want to do right by poor kids? Unfortunately, there are.\u201d",
      "Historically, most complaints to the department have involved disability discrimination, but last year accusations of sex discrimination surged to account for more than half of all complaints, according to an annual report. Disability discrimination accounted for 37%, while discrimination over race or national origin accounted for 19%.",
      "In addition to its duty to investigate complaints, the office creates federal rules to interpret federal law for schools and colleges. That role has been at the center of a political tug-of-war over Title IX, with recent administrations repeatedly rewriting the rules governing investigations of campus sexual misconduct.",
      "The Biden administration issued new rules last year expanding Title IX to protect transgender and LGBTQ+ students, and boosting victims\u2019 rights. A federal judge overturned the rules in January, reverting to a previous set of rules from Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "In a memo to schools and colleges last week, the Office for Civil Rights emphasized that the earlier Trump rules would be enforced, but it created confusion about how to handle cases that were opened when Biden\u2019s rules were in effect. With no communication from the department, there has been little clarity for schools.",
      "There are also questions about how antisemitism investigations will change. Trump has used heated rhetoric to push for more aggressive action against colleges found to have tolerated antisemitism, and Trainor blasted the Biden administration for signing \u201ctoothless\u201d agreements to resolve cases. No new guidance has been issued to lawyers who investigate cases.",
      "As the office awaits orders to resume its work, it faces a growing backlog of complaints.",
      "Before Trump took office, there were more than 140 open investigations involving shared ancestry, many of them dealing with antisemitism or Islamophobia. The Biden administration opened more than 100 investigations after Oct. 7, 2023. A flurry of schools reached deals to settle the cases before Trump took office amid fears that he would issue heavier sanctions.",

      "The former interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani is expected to be sentenced for bank and tax fraud",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The former interpreter for Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani is expected to be sentenced Thursday for bank and tax fraud after he stole nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers player\u2019s bank account.",
      "Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of four years and nine months for Ippei Mizuhara, who was supposed to bridge the gap between Ohtani and his English-speaking teammates and fans as the duo traveled from Southern California to ballparks across the U.S. Instead, Mizuhara exploited the Japanese-English language barrier to isolate Ohtani and profit from his proximity to the two-way player \u2019s power.",
      "Mizuhara is scheduled to appear in federal court in the Orange County city of Santa Ana. He pleaded guilty last year to bank and tax fraud after he was accused of stealing money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, in addition to $325,000 worth of baseball cards and his own dental bills.",
      "The case affected arguably the world\u2019s most famous baseball player \u2014 who previously pitched for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim \u2014 and stoked an international media frenzy. It stemmed from a broader probe into illegal sports bookmaking organizations in Southern California and the laundering of proceeds through casinos in Las Vegas that has netted a dozen defendants.",
      "\u201cHis years-long theft of funds from Mr. Ohtani and the myriad lies he told to Mr. Ohtani\u2019s agents and financial advisors to cover up his theft represent a calculated betrayal of the very person he was hired to help,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.",
      "They want Mizuhara to pay $17 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1 million to the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "In a letter to the court, Mizuhara described his financial strain and addiction to gambling, which he had hoped would alleviate his money problems. He also professed his admiration of Ohtani, and his remorse.",
      "\u201cI am asking for a little mercy from the court concerning my sentence you will hand down,\u201d Mizuhara wrote. \u201cI truly admire Shohei as a baseball player and a human being and I was committed to devote my life so Shohei can be the best version of himself on the field. I want to say I am truly sorry for violating his trust in me.\u201d",
      "Mizuhara accessed Ohtani\u2019s account beginning in 2021 and changed its security protocols so he could impersonate him to authorize wire transfers. By 2024, Mizuhara had used the money to buy about $325,000 worth of baseball cards at online resellers and had bet tens of millions of dollars that weren\u2019t his to wager on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.",
      "Prosecutors said Mizuhara never bet on baseball, and Ohtani was an unknowing victim of the scheme.",
      "\u201cLet there be no doubt, Mr. Ohtani is truly a victim and has suffered, and will continue to suffer, harm from defendant\u2019s conduct,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Michael G. Freedman, Mizuhara's attorney, wrote in court filings that his client is a gambling addict who made a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and has suffered from a loss of a job and reputation. Mizuhara takes responsibility for his actions and expects to be deported to his native Japan after serving time, Freedman wrote while asking for a sentence of one and a half years.",
      "Mizuhara was born in Japan and moved to California with his parents when he was 6. He struggled to learn English but eventually did, and he returned to Japan in 2013 to become an interpreter for a Japanese baseball team and later for Ohtani, according to court filings.",
      "The two formed a tight-knit bond, and Mizuhara moved with Ohtani in 2018 to the U.S., where he took on numerous errands for the player such as grocery shopping, Freedman wrote.",
      "Inside baseball, Mizuhara stood by Ohtani\u2019s side for many of the athlete's career highlights, from serving as his catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 All-Star Game, to being there for his two American League MVP wins and his record-shattering $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Off the field, Mizuhara was Ohtani\u2019s friend and confidant. He famously resigned from the Los Angeles Angels during the 2021 MLB lockout so he could keep speaking to Ohtani, and he was rehired after a deal was struck.",
      "Last year, Ohtani and the Dodgers won the World Series, and the baseball star won his third Most Valuable Player award."

      "Nassau County Democratic lawmakers argue in their complaint filed Wednesday that Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman lacked the legal authority to form a cadre of special sheriff's deputies with \u201cauthority to use deadly force and make arrests under color of law.\u201d",
      "They say state law authorizes local sheriffs to deputize only trained law enforcement officers from other agencies in emergencies \u2014 not private citizens.",
      "\u201cNew York State law is clear: only professional, sworn officers can wield police powers,\u201d said Kelner, whose firm Kelner & Kelner filed the lawsuit on behalf of Democratic lawmakers. \u201cBlakeman\u2019s militia is illegal and a clear threat to public safety.\"",
      "Democrats, who are the minority in the county legislature, also complain Blakeman's office has ignored their public records requests seeking basic details of the program, including who is being recruited, the scope of their training, the specific weapons they will carry and the total taxpayer cost of the program.",
      "Blakeman didn't immediately respond to the secrecy claims, but in a statement dismissed the suit as \u201cfrivolous\" and suggested Democrats were defaming the volunteer deputies, many of whom are retired military and law enforcement officers.",
      "He has said the armed deputies are required to be licensed gun owners, must complete 12 hours of classroom instruction and practice on the firing range.",
      "He's also stressed the deputies would only be called on when the county, located just east of the New York City borough of Queens, faces a natural disaster or other major emergency.",
      "The deputies would be assigned to protect government buildings, hospitals and critical infrastructure, and not be used to quell protests or patrol streets, as Democrats and other critics have suggested, according to Blakeman.",
      "A spokesperson for the county didn\u2019t provide an update Wednesday but as of last summer about two dozen had completed training with plans to have about 50 total in place.",
      "Democrats, in their suit, note the county already has one of the largest local police forces in the nation, with some 2,600 sworn officers. State troopers also serve Nassau County and dozens of local villages have their own police forces.",
      "The county can also call up hundreds of unarmed civilian volunteers through the Nassau County Auxiliary Police and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management Community Emergency Response Team, according to the litigation.",
      "\"Defendants have not publicly explained how a group of less than one hundred armed civilians would materially aid the thousands of trained, registered, sworn, and armed police and peace officers available to meet the needs of Nassau County residents in the event of an emergency,\" the lawsuit states. \u201cAuthorizing minimally trained private citizens to wield force on behalf of the government \u2013 and during an emergency no less \u2013 poses clear and obvious safety risks, both to trained law enforcement and the public at large.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:08:55 GMT",
    "summary": "A cut to interest rates could mean lower mortgage rates.",
    "story": [
      "Interest rates are expected to be cut by the Bank of England later, in a move closely watched by households and economists.",
      "Analysts predict the benchmark rate will be cut from 4.75% to 4.5%, given the recent weakness in the UK economy which has seen slow growth.",
      "The Bank rate is the primary tool aimed at controlling inflation, and hopes of a cut rose after the inflation rate - which charts the rising cost of living - fell to 2.5% in the year to December.",
      "However, it remains above the Bank's target of 2%, and changes in the Budget are forecast to push it up.",
      "Economic uncertainty has been heightened, owing to US President Donald Trump's introduction, or threat, of import tariffs. They could lead to inflationary pressure globally, causing a knock-on effect on price rises in the UK.",
      "Why do interest rates change?",
      "The Bank moves rates up and down to try to control inflation, which measures the pace of overall price rises.",
      "By raising rates, borrowing is made more expensive, so people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows the rate at which prices are rising.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy as it discourages businesses from investing and creating more jobs.",
      "Once price rises are more under control, then the Bank will consider lowering interest rates.",
      "Its base interest rate heavily influences the rates High Street banks and other money lenders charge customers for loans, credit cards and other finance deals.",
      "This is most obviously seen in the cost of mortgages. Reducing the base rate would see an immediate impact for those on \"tracker\" mortgages.",
      "About 629,000 mortgage-holders have tracker deals. Typically, their monthly repayment would fall by about \u00a329 as a result of the expected 0.25 percentage point cut later.",
      "A similar number of householders have variable rate deals, and lenders will be under pressure to cut their rates if the Bank reduces the base rate.",
      "Fixed rate deals do not change immediately, but the expectation of further rate cuts could lead to new, or renewing, borrowers getting a better deal.",
      "Savers would be hit by a base rate fall, as the return they receive from banks would also be likely to be cut.",
      "'Gradual approach'",
      "In December, when rates were held at 4.75%, the Bank's Governor, Andrew Bailey, said it would take a \"gradual approach to future interest rate cuts\".",
      "But he added: \"We can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year.\"",
      "In the minutes from that meeting, the Bank said there was uncertainty \"around how the measures that had been announced in the autumn Budget were affecting growth\".",
      "Following November's meeting, Mr Bailey would not be drawn on the impact of Trump tariffs on the UK economy, saying \"let's wait and see\".",
      "In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has indicated it will cut rates at a slower pace this year.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "When the Bank announces its interest rates decision at 12:00 it will also share a report on where it sees inflation going in the coming months and could hint at its strategy in response.",
      "Cutting the UK interest rate would strike a balance between \"supporting an economy that appears to have ground to a complete halt and preventing inflation from taking off again\", economist Paul Dales from Capital Economics told the BBC.",
      "\"Trump's tariffs are unlikely to influence UK interest rates much,\" he added, but wage growth being faster than the Bank's forecast could influence its decision.",
      "The UK economy grew by less than expected in November, after not growing at all in the previous two months. A further slowdown is expected as businesses brace for rising costs from April because of budgetary changes like rising National Insurance contributions and higher minimum wages.",

      "While the White House is claiming Canada's pledge to spend $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) on a border protection plan has given it diplomatic victory in its battle over fentanyl traffic, there was very little conceded that was not already planned by America's northern neighbour.",

      "The rationale for his tariffs keeps changing and much about this situation defies logical explanation.",
      "So, Mexico, Canada and every other country facing tariffs or the threat of them have to decipher what Trump is really playing at.",
      "And when they've done that, the question for the whole world is whether what we are seeing is an attempt by the US president to rewrite the entire global monetary system - and at what risk to America?",
      "The contradictions",
      "Trump has claimed that fentanyl trafficking was the legal pretext for tariffs, allowing him to bypass Congress and use emergency powers to impose border taxes on Canada, Mexico and China, by declaring an \"unusual or extraordinary threat\".",
      "But while talking about the fentanyl trade, he also referred to Canada's goods trade surplus with the US (which means Canada sells more to the US than it imports), and introduced the idea that Canada should become the \"51st state\" of America.",
      "While any country might demand talks about both illicit and legal trade flows, it is difficult to see how to handle these conversations when there is a parallel threat of continental annexation of a free trade ally which is also part of Nato and one of the Group of Seven (G7) most advanced economies in the world.",
      "A disputed surplus",
      "Europe, meanwhile, seems unwilling to stir the pot as it attempts to work out the president's precise motivations and how this feeds itself into what he decides over Transatlantic tariffs.",
      "Trump's long-standing animus with the EU comes from the bloc's substantial goods trade surplus with the US, arising from areas such as high-end German car exports.",
      "Underlying all of this is a perceived unfairness that other markets are more restrictive against America such as when it comes to the prices paid for US drugs or fines placed on US tech companies.",
      "But if this really is about trade deficits, it is something of a mystery as to why Trump has not yet announced tariffs against the likes of Vietnam, Japan and South Korea - who have far bigger surpluses with the US.",
      "In any case, for Trump to focus solely on goods means that he is willingly ignoring the US's great export - services.",
      "I put this precise point to the EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic last month.",
      "He told me: \"Sure, we have a trade surplus in goods, but the US has a trade surplus in services.",
      "\"And on top of it, every year, \u20ac300bn (\u00a3249bn) is flowing across the Atlantic into the American companies from our pension funds, from the saving accounts of the European citizens because they're investing in the US. So I think that it's a pretty balanced relationship.\"",
      "As it happens, the UK trade position with the US is more balanced, a point made to me by the Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds. In fact, on some measures, the US has a surplus with Britain.",
      "Amid the fog of Trump's true intentions,  European negotiators have resorted to stressing co-operation, partnership and deals with the US and studiously avoided directly criticising even the extraordinary suggestion of using tariffs against Nato-ally Denmark over the fate of Greenland.",
      "A negotiating tool",
      "In November 2024, Stephen Miran, before becoming President Trump's White House chief economics advisor, authored a paper laying out further questions that could determine how much more the US should tariff specific countries.",
      "These ranged from an assessment of whether a country applies similar tariffs to the US, suppresses its currency, respects US intellectual property, pays its Nato obligations, votes against the US at the United Nations or its \"leaders grandstand against the US in the international theatre\".",
      "It also talked of forcing other nations \"to choose between facing a tariff on their exports to the American consumer or applying tariffs to their imports from China\", asking: \"Which will they choose?\"",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "Best of 'frenemies': Trump's relationship with Europe this time may be very different",
      "Growth at all costs? Why Reeves is in a sudden rush on the economy",
      "The president himself was pretty clear in his video address to a stunned World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January.",
      "\"Your choice,\" he said to the assembled international executives. Build your goods in American factories with tax incentives, or import into the US from foreign factories and pay tariffs that would raise \"hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars\" for the US Treasury.",
      "\"Most of the world has come to understand that Trump does use tariffs as a negotiating tool,\" Stephen Moore, a former Trump economic advisor who recently visited the president, told me.",
      "Across the board",
      "It may be that a part of Trump's logic is very simple: remodel the US tax system so that everything coming into the country attracts a levy but, in return, the public sees income tax rates slashed.",
      "\"By the way, I do think at the end of the day, there will be an across-the-board tariff imposed by Trump,\" says Mr Moore.",
      "\"He's talked about this, that if you're bringing something into the United States whether it's from Britain, whether it's Mexico, Canada, China, Europe, you're going to pay a little bit more but if something is made in the United States, he's going to lower the tax. And to a lot of Americans, that's a very attractive proposition.\"",
      "Mr Moore has suggested a 15% universal tariff on all imports from everywhere in order to fund a cut in income tax rates down to 15%.",
      "A fundamental change",
      "Mr Miran's paper also contains a proposal that led to jaws dropping in global central banks and finance ministries: bring down the value of the dollar in order to boost US industry and exports.",
      "Arranging this would mean a fundamental change to the way the global monetary system operates. But Mr Miran suggests that punitive tariffs could be used as leverage to make reluctant trading partners like Europe and China \"become more receptive\" to the idea.",
      "He suggests that in time there could be a summit of the world's economic powers, where allies and rivals thrash out the revaluation of the dollar, perhaps at the president's Florida residence. It could be known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord.",
      "Early discussions of the idea in international forums have been highly sceptical, recalling the history of similar attempts to manage global currency values.",
      "But it is the recently published concept of the top White House economic advisor. Tariff now, tariff hard and tariff everywhere in order to, in the future, get the world to help bring down the value of the dollar.",
      "Show strength",
      "Such a radical idea comes with risk and already simply with the tariffs, there is a danger for the White House that the US overplays its hand.",
      "Mark Carney, who is frontrunner to replace Justin Trudeau as Canadian Liberal Party leader, and as Prime Minister, at least until an election, has a rather unique approach.",
      "The former governor of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada decided to come out punching, ridiculing the fentanyl rationale and telling the BBC that Canada would retaliate \"dollar for dollar\" and that Canadians would \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "He said that the tariff move would rebound on the US economy itself by fuelling inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and crippling the ability of the US to sign trade deals, given they would have effectively ripped up their biggest  - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - just a few years after the president had personally renegotiated it.",
      "Mr Carney then publicly suggested that Canada removes a subsidy from exports to the US of its oil, and stressed that Canada's green investments might need to be protected from US carbon emissions.",
      "For those countries like the UK trying to avoid tariffs, he had a simple message: \"Good luck\".",
      "The clear sense was that from his own experience of having dealt with Trump at the G20, the way to deal with him was to show strength.",
      "The risk of retaliation",
      "This is partly a calculation that the muted opposition to these policies within the US will not be sustained. Again, the harder, more strategic and more coordinated the retaliation, the more pause for thought it will give big US corporates and some in the competing courts around the President.",
      "Elon Musk, the normally prolific social media poster on his X platform and chief executive of electric vehicle-maker Tesla, was curiously largely quiet about the single biggest move from the president.",
      "He eventually reposted the news from the Mexican president that their tariffs had been delayed.",
      "A leading US tech chief executive told me that his company was already making plans, assuming they would be on the receiving end of retaliatory tariffs.",
      "His hope was that Trump's focus on the rising value of the US stock market would create a natural restraint against excessive tariffs. Some saw the modest fall on the Dow Jones index on Monday as contributing to this week's pauses.",
      "Retaliation is standard procedure in trade wars.",
      "Indeed in the most famous of them all, when US Republicans passed the calamitous 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Canada was the first to hit back, doing so before the US had even finished legislating. History points to Henry Ford being one of those begging Herbert Hoover to veto the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930.",
      "An integrated industry",
      "And, in 2025, the car industry is one obvious potential tariff loser.",
      "\"It's true to say that there is no such thing as a Canadian auto industry, an American auto industry and a Mexican auto industry,\" says Peter Frise, a professor of mechanical and automotive engineering at the University of Windsor.",
      "\"There are Canadian, American, and Mexican components of a North American auto industry and the integration among the three countries is absolutely foundational to how the industry works.\"",
      "Not only are models like the Honda Civic, which is hugely popular in the US, manufactured in Canada - Prof Frise says \"very few\" cars assembled in the US will not contain some parts that come from across the border. And so, says he adds, tariffs \"would drive up costs for everyone\" - US consumers included.",
      "Others diversify",
      "Another risk for Trump is that as Mr Carney and Mr Sefcovic said, they are all now responding to the direction of US trade policy by diversifying with one another. The EU is busy doing trade deals with Latin America. \"There is huge demand in the outside world for free and fair trade relationships,\" says Mr Sefcovic.",
      "The UK has also restarted trade negotiations with India and the Gulf countries.",
      "Reynolds says that the \"challenging international position\" means the UK has to push its \"genuine competitive advantage\" as the \"most connected market in the world\" with the US, the EU and China.",
      "An extensive and surprising tariff war",
      "The other issue here is that if the direction of travel is a universal tariff, as Trump and his advisors keep suggesting, is there much incentive to try to avoid it?",
      "There is some startling thinking circulating in Trumponomics circles. It is talk of that revenue grab of trillions of dollars that is spooking even allies who think they might escape the tariffs.",
      "It sounds like a wild economic gamble. But such talk is relative, at a time when the US president is putting tariffs on his closest economic G7 and Nato partner over fentanyl, while simultaneously claiming it should become part of the US.",
      "It could be an extensive and surprising tariff war. This week's trade dramas are just early skirmishes.",

    "story": [
      "Norwegian energy giant Equinor is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production.",
      "Chief executive Anders Opedal said that the transition to lower carbon energy was moving slower than expected, costs had increased, and customers were reluctant to commit to long term contracts.",
      "Mr Opedal told the BBC he was confident that Rosebank - a giant new oil field in the North Sea - would go ahead, despite a recent court ruling that consent had been awarded unlawfully.",
      "He also warned that gas prices could rise next winter as European gas storage levels were lower now than this time last year.",
      "\"We are scaling down our investments in renewables and low carbon solutions because we don't see the necessary profitability in the future,\" Mr Opedal said.",
      "It will cut investments in renewables to $5bn over the next two years, down from about $10bn.",
      "It will also drop a target to spend half of its fixed assets budget on renewables and low carbon products by 2030.",
      "By contrast, Equinor will be increasing oil and gas production by 10% over the next two years.",
      "Rosebank 'not straightforward'",
      "The controversial Rosebank oil field is thought to hold 500 million barrels of oil.",
      "A Scottish court recently ruled that consent had been granted unlawfully as the application did not account for the full environmental impact of the project.",
      "Many within the UK government - including the Energy Secretary Ed Miliband - are opposed to it.",
      "Mr Opedal acknowledged it was a divisive issue but insisted it was good for the UK economy.",
      "\"This is an important project for us. It provides local jobs in Scotland, local jobs in the UK, so we think this project will move forward,\" he said. \"We think that Western Europe and the UK should produce the oil and gas it uses instead of being dependent on other countries outside Europe.\"",
      "Climate campaigners and the oil industry both claimed victory at the Supreme Court ruling as although the consent was revoked, the court allowed preparatory work to continue on Rosebank while new consents are sought.",
      "The government said it has \"already consulted\" on emissions from burning extracted oil and gas, and will incorporate the results of the consultation when making revisions to environmental guidance.",
      "\"Our priority is to deliver a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, which drives towards our clean energy future of energy security, lower bills, and good, long-term jobs,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Tessa Khan, from the environmental campaign group Uplift which, along with Greenpeace, brought judicial reviews to stop the development of Rosebank, said Equinor was getting ahead of itself.",
      "\"I think it's in the industry's interest to make it sound like it's a tick box exercise to get Rosebank over the line,\" she said.",
      "\"There is a regulatory process that needs to be satisfied, and there are very strong public interest arguments against developing Rosebank, so we don't think it will be a straightforward decision at all.\"",
      "She added that new oil and gas fields will not bring down UK bills or improve UK energy security, as renewables would, because the oil is drilled and sold for export.",
      "\"I think we should be honest about whether or not oil and gas companies are good faith partners in the energy transition and interested in lowering people's energy bills. I think the answer now is very clearly 'no',\" she said.",
      "Trump stance 'positive'",
      "Equinor follows other energy companies in reducing investment in renewables. Shell and BP have both scaled back their future plans.",
      "Mr Opedal appeared to welcome Donald Trump's invitation to the industry to \"drill, baby, drill\" but said energy prices, not the US president, would dictate future exploration and production.",
      "\"When I hear 'drill, baby, drill', I see that as a positive sentiment to the oil and gas business but I think companies will always decide on drilling programs based on price signals,\" said Mr Opedal.",
      "\"If prices go down, less wells will be drilled, if it goes up, more will be drilled.\"",
      "When asked how this was compatible with his target to make Equinor net zero by 2050, he conceded that drilling more now would make it harder in later years.",
      "Mr Opedal also warned that low levels of gas storage in Europe as it exits this winter could mean higher prices next year.",
      "\"Gas storage levels will be lower this spring, meaning that Europe will need to fill up larger amounts of gas to keep it at the same level,\" Mr Opedal added. \"The increase in underlying demand for gas from China means more competition for energy which has the potential to increase prices.\"",

      "Nuclear power provides around 15% of the UK's electricity but many of the country's ageing reactors are due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Are we seeing the opening moves in a wider trade war, and what are the potential economic consequences?",
    "story": [
      "Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.",
      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",
      "But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?",
      "Trump's 10% tariff on China begins as Beijing plans retaliation on US energy and some cars",
      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",
      "Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:18:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Economists warn that the introduction of tariffs could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has hit the pause button - for now, at least - on imposing tariffs against imports from US neighbours Canada and Mexico.",
      "Last-minute agreements with the leaders of Mexico and Canada have suspended for a month a tit-for-tat trade war in North America.",
      "The three trade partners have deeply integrated economies and supply chains, with an estimated $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.",
      "Trump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.",
      "So what could get more expensive if Trump's tariffs do eventually go ahead?",
      "Cars",
      "Cars would probably go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "As a result of higher taxes paid on the importing of parts to build the cars, it is likely the costs will be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said Andrew Foran, an economist at TD Economics.",
      "He added \"uninterrupted free trade\" in the car-making sector had \"existed for decades\", which had led to lower prices for consumers.",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and MexicoWhat are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico",
      "What are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Beer, Tennessee whiskey and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that rather than passing on the cost increase, firms could just import less.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "It's more complex when it comes to spirits. The sector has been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They say that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. The trade bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in all three countries.",
      "Houses",
      "Imports of Canadian lumber would be hit by import tariffs to the US. Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry body has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "When it comes to the trade war with Canada, the \"most obvious\" household impact would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but that are produced using inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada.",
      "While 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.",
      "Now the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided in retaliation to any US tariffs to reduce crude oil exports, that could lead to prices rising at the petrol pumps.",
      "Avocados",
      "One food import that American consumers could see a significant price increase in is avocados. Grown primarily in Mexico due to its warm, humid climate, Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "However, if tariffs come into force, the US Agriculture Department has warned that the cost of avocados - along with popular avocado-based dishes like guacamole - could surge, especially by Super Bowl Sunday on 9 February.",
      "What about goods in Canada?",
      "Before Trump's agreement with Justin Trudeau to pause tariffs was announced on Monday, Canada had threatened retaliatory import taxes.",
      "An initial C$30bn tranche had been due to begin on Tuesday - meaning prices would have probably increased for consumers north of the border as well.",
      "Ottawa had released a list of all the US imports that would have immediately been targeted with matching 25% tariffs. They included grocery store staples, like oranges - a produce that Canada cannot grow in abundance due to its cooler climate.",
      "Alcohol originating from the US would also be harder for Canadians to find. Provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia said they would pull all American booze off their shelves starting on Tuesday.",
      "Any US alcohol - including beer and wine - that Canadians could find would likely see a price increase, as it's on the menu for retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Canadian shoppers might feel the pinch from a weaker Canadian dollar if shopping online.",

      "Lenders to the debt-saddled company are offering up to \u00a33bn in additional short-term loans to buy time to complete a major restructuring of the UK's biggest water and waste company.",
      "Failure to secure approval will see Thames edge closer to a temporary nationalisation, which could cost the government some \u00a32bn a year.",
      "The company is still considering whether to appeal against a decision by the water industry regulator Ofwat to increase bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years \u2013 short of the 53% increase it applied for.",
      "Thames Water has been struggling for some time and has been heavily criticised over its performance following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The dire state of the company's finances emerged about 18 months ago when it began a search for funding to avoid collapse.",
      "The Thames fiasco is a combination of poor historical regulation, greedy shareholders, climate change and management failure. Its debt pile is currently about \u00a317bn.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies to households will continue as normal.",
      "In the latest bid to survive, lenders have offered Thames a further loan of up to \u00a33bn in two instalments.",
      "The first payment is to get it through to the autumn, and a second is to be used if the company decides to appeal against Ofwat's 35% bill rise to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - a process that could take up to a year.",
      "The company has until 18 February to launch an appeal to the CMA.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "The water industry is in crisis. Can it be fixed?",
      "Investment bank Rothschild is also soliciting bids to take over the company and inject much-needed funds.",
      "The court hearing on Monday is scheduled for four days with a possible extension as a much smaller group of lenders is challenging the terms of the lifeline and proposing an alternative.",
      "Although Thames will not collapse immediately if the deal is not approved by the judge, insiders have acknowledged that the company will move a step closer to temporary nationalisation \u2013 a so-called Special Administration Regime \u2013 if it fails.",
      "The government has already sounded out a number of consultancies to take that on if the situation arises.",
      "The company has been keen to stress that whatever happens, its services to 16 million customers would continue uninterrupted, but big questions about the future of Thames and other key infrastructure providers have been thrown up.",
      "Some argue that Thames should be allowed to go bust and have the government take over the company due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt, took out big dividends and paid executives handsomely. Caving in to its demands for customers to pay more now for a failing service would be a gross injustice.",
      "Others say that poor regulation has allowed this mess. Bills were kept too low for too long which hampered investment in the aging infrastructure that is now being overwhelmed by a wetter climate. Ofwat is fighting yesterday's battle and making things worse by imposing fines of tens of millions of pounds for failures, thus further depriving the company of the funds to fix the very things it is being fined for.",
      "What Thames and ministers both agree on is that neither want this sprawling company on the government's books. Consultancy Teneo has predicted a temporary nationalisation would cost up to \u00a32bn a year.",
      "However, a wider, perhaps more important argument made by some is that the failure of Thames as a private company would send an unhelpful message to the international investors that Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes will invest hundreds of billions in UK airports, wind farms, rail links and everything else on her long shopping list of growth-boosting projects.",
      "Sources close to the company and its creditors argue that we cannot agonise over and regulate for past mistakes. We are where we are - between a rock and a hard place. Carve out a special deal for Thames - or risk its collapse.",
      "Thames has just over two weeks to appeal to the CMA to bump up the bills it's allowed to charge. It's not without risk - the CMA could revise them down.",
      "Last week, the chair of the CMA was forced out by ministers unimpressed by the regulator's focus on growth. Thames says it needs higher bills to invest \u00a320bn over the next five years. It will be an interesting test case for the new chair."

      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3.1tn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.",

      "If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.",

      "All three scenarios are theoretically possible.",
      "But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.",

      "Let\u2019s use a concrete example.",
      "Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.",
      "Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.",
      "There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.",
      "The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.",
      "A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.",
      "The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.",
      "Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.",
      "\u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail.",
      "The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.",
      "In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.",
      "Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.",
      "And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.",
      "Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.",
      "By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",
      "It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.",
      "And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Impact on trade deficit",
      "Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.",
      "\u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said.",
      "In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.",
      "Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.",
      "Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.",
      "For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.",
      "The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.",
      "There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.",
      "Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.",
      "And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.",
      "It also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

    "summary": "A union accuses QUB of \"directing taxpayer money into axing jobs in NI while creating them on foreign shores\".",
    "story": [
      "Queen's University Belfast has been criticised for its decision to open a campus in India, after it announced 270 job cuts in Northern Ireland through a voluntary redundancy scheme.",
      "The University and College Union, which represents many lecturers and support staff, described the move as \"scandalous\".",
      "It said Queen's receives \"significant funding\" from Stormont and accused the university of using public money to fund redundancies in Belfast while expanding abroad.",
      "However Queen's said it was facing a financial deficit amid a \"sharp decline\" in international students and so it had to take a number of actions to cut its costs. It added the redundancy scheme was wholly voluntary.",
      "The 270 redundancies at its Belfast campus were announced in October.",
      "It equates to more than 5% of the university's workforce.",
      "At the time, BBC News NI saw documents which suggested Queen's University Belfast (QUB) was facing a deficit of more than \u00a311m for the financial year 2024-25.",
      "Then last week, the university announced that it plans to open a campus in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in India next year.",
      "It said the move would \"reinforce partnerships and opportunities for innovation with local industry, government and business sectors across India and Northern Ireland\".",

      "\"It is scandalous that QUB is putting massive amounts of money into a new campus halfway round the world all the while axing jobs in Belfast,\" said UCU general secretary Jo Grady.",
      "Katharine Clarke, from the UCU, told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that Northern Ireland universities were in a better position financially compared to the rest of the UK, as more than 50% of the university's funding comes from the Department for the Economy.",

      "Queen's India campus costing \u00a35m-\u00a37m",
      "However, QUB acting chief people officer Alistair Finlay defended the decision to open the campus in India, adding that the current funding model for higher education did not work as the money from Stormont did not cover the costs of home students from Northern Ireland.",
      "He said Queen's was investing between \u00a35m-\u00a37m in the new campus.",
      "Addressing concerns around financial transparency with the union, Mr Finlay told Good Morning Ulster that QUB had provided a \"large amount of information\".",

      "In its statement, QUB said it was reacting to the financial challenges \"being faced right across the UK higher education sector\".",
      "It explained that Northern Ireland universities \"face an additional challenge\" because of a cap on the number of \"home students\" it can admit.",
      "In previous years, QUB balanced its books through the fees charges to international students, but there is now a \"sharp decline\" in those students coming to the UK.",

      "Parents said they were not told the nature of the questions in advance and were not asked to agree that their children's private information could be shared.",
      "A Scottish government spokeswoman said it had been \"made clear\" that the data \u2013 once shared with them - would only be used for statistics and research purposes and that pupils would not be identifiable from the results.",
      "The Health and Wellbeing census was organised and promoted by the Scottish government but half of Scotland's 32 councils pulled out following concerns about a lack of informed consent and worries over the anonymity for pupils.",
      "What is the school 'sex survey' row about?",

      "In the end, 16 councils went ahead: Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dumfries and Galloway, Dundee, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, Moray, North Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, Renfrewshire, Scottish Borders, Shetland, South Ayrshire and Stirling.",
      "The pupils answered the questions online in classrooms and were told on the survey form itself that the information would not be shared.",
      "In a section called \"What Happens to My Answers?\" it says: \"The local authority will not tell anyone your answers, not your teacher or your family.\"",
      "However, the data is now being offered publicly to external researchers via the website of Research Data Scotland, a charity created by the Scottish government in 2021 with a stated aim of making it easier to access data around health and wellbeing.",
      "The Scottish government did have a section on its website which said that \"individual level data may be shared for research purposes\".",
      "But many parents claim they were unaware that the answers might be used in this way \u2013 especially because the survey and communication about it were handled by individual councils.",
      "At the time of the survey, campaigners warned that it must protect children's right to privacy and give informed consent.",
      "However, consent was done on an \"opt-out\" basis, meaning parents or pupils had to specifically refuse to take part.",

      "'Many parents never received letters'",
      "Sonia, a parent from the east of Scotland who did not want to be identified, told the BBC she had grave concerns about the way children's data was gathered and how it was now being shared.",
      "\"A lot of parents don't even know their children participated in this,\" she said.",
      "\"134,000 children participated, none of them with active parent consent and many parents never received the letters.",
      "\"They never opened the email or the letter is crumpled at the bottom of the school bag.\"",
      "Sonia said the health and wellbeing census had not initially sounded risky or sensitive.",
      "\"It was only once you then looked several layers down into the information that you realised this was a much bigger exercise,\" she said.",
      "\"They also wouldn't let parents see the questions.",
      "\"I think, once we're starting to keep secrets from parents and secrets from children and we're not asking parents to actively consent then we create a whole new level of risk and we start to break trust between schools and parents.\"",
      "Academics say there are serious concerns about sharing the data without consent and about linking it to other datasets, as this significantly raises the risk of identifying children and their answers.",
      "Lindsay Paterson, professor of education at Edinburgh University, said linking the information to other large datasets, including those about ethnicity, meant it would be far too easy to identify individual children \u2013 especially in smaller rural schools.",
      "He said he had serious concerns about the \"unethical\" way the data was now being shared.",
      "\"No child and no parent has been asked for permission to pass the data on to other people,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"That's not to imply that individual researchers are unethical, but the point is the ethical protection is there for a good reason because sadly some people will get access to the data and will abuse the confidentiality, the trust that should be there.\"",
      "One of the biggest concerns raised at the time of the survey was that it included pupils' individual candidate numbers \u2013 through which children could potentially be identified.",
      "In emails seen by the BBC, the Information Commissioner's Office warned the Scottish government in 2023 that the way they had gathered, stored and transferred the data created potential risks that children could be identified by \"third parties and rogue actors\".",
      "It says it has engaged with local authorities and the government to help them implement measures to protect the data, and that it was continuing to monitor this work.",

      "However, the report cards have drawn strong criticism from school leaders, who said the proposals risk \"replicating the worst aspects of the current system\".",
      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",
      "The changes follow a major public debate around Ofsted after a coroner ruled that an inspection contributed to the death of primary school head teacher Mrs Perry in 2023.",
      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",
      "Those schools which do not improve will be transferred to a successful academy trust, even if they are already run by a different academy or a council.",
      "Under Ofsted's proposals, the old one or two-word judgements, ranging across four grades from \"Outstanding\" to \"Inadequate\", will be replaced from the 2025 autumn term by a report card describing what inspectors have found on key aspects of each school, including:",

      "Quality of education",
      "Behaviour and attendance",

      "A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met.",
      "The new format will be used for inspections across all settings, from early years to further education colleges, but will be tailored to the type of provider, Ofsted said.",
      "Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver said the proposals were designed to \"raise standards and improve the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged\".",
      "He said the \"suite of grades\" would give parents \"much more detail\" and help identify a school's strengths and areas for improvement.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Bad Boy Records staff claim troubling incidents in the rise of the rap mogul, now fighting sex trafficking charges.",
    "story": [
      "\"I have so much money now that I could hire someone to kill you, and nobody would know. No-one would miss you. No-one would know anything.\"",
      "Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - then known as Puff Daddy - to a colleague. It was 1997, he says, in the New York office of Combs's Grammy Award-winning music label Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

      "The actress has released several statements since then, saying she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments have been taken out of context.",
      "In the days since, Hollywood has distanced itself from her posts, while Netflix appears to have refocused its campaign efforts on the film's other nominees.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n said she had been on a \"rollercoaster of emotions\" in the past week in her latest statement published on Instagram (she has currently deactivated her X account).",
      "\"What a coincidence I've been trying to send a message of hope to the world for nine months and just three days ago I casually am the worst person in the world,\" she added.",
      "The tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.",
      "Netflix has not publicly commented (BBC News approached the streamer for this article), but the company has been distancing itself from her comments in recent days.",
      "Here is how the campaign around Gasc\u00f3n has changed, following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the so-called For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released on Monday almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has released several statements on the controversy in recent days, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she has also given an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team may not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the next week or so.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress is now not expected to appear at any of them, as the turmoil continues.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After the tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Then, on Sunday, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacque Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "As for Emilia P\u00e9rez as a whole, the controversy could make its chances of a best picture win far less likely, particularly in a year where there is no breakout frontrunner for best picture.",

    "story": [
      "It was the programme which brought to TV audiences one of the great 20th Century novels and revolutionised how drama was made in Scotland.",
      "Now, 54 years later, BBC Scotland's ground-breaking 1971 production of Sunset Song is being shown again in a re-mastered version to mark the 90th anniversary of author Lewis Grassic Gibbon's death.",
      "The serial, acclaimed as one of the finest dramas made by the BBC, will be followed by sequels Cloud Howe and Grey Granite, which were made in the early 1980s.",
      "It is a fresh chance to see why both the novel and the dramas endure.",
      "Sunset Song was written in 1932, the first of three books telling the story of Chris Guthrie, a young woman who lives and works on her family farm in the Mearns, the farming areas south of Aberdeen.",
      "Beginning just before World War One, the novel and its sequels follow Chris from the countryside of her childhood to a big city, touching on class, war, religion and female emancipation.",
      "Lewis Grassic Gibbon was the pen name of James Leslie Mitchell, who had been raised in the Mearns. He was a journalist in Aberdeen, Glasgow and London and a passionate socialist.",
      "He published A Scots Quair, as the trilogy became known, between 1932-1934, the final volume appearing just a year before his untimely death aged 33.",
      "The journalist and author James Naughtie was brought up in nearby Banffshire and knows well the area in which Sunset Song is set.",
      "He remembers the effect reading it had on him as a teenager in the late 1960s.",
      "\"I remember being very gripped by it emotionally. I think that it's a book that young people can become involved in and respond to very viscerally. It became something that I realised was a book I would never forget,\" he says.",
      "In March 1971, the six-episode-long television adaptation hit the screens. It was the first colour drama made by BBC Scotland and was greeted with huge acclaim.",
      "Adapted by Bill Craig and directed by Moira Armstrong, it featured some of Scotland's greatest acting talent, including Andrew Keir, Roddy McMillan and Paul Young.",
      "Chris was played by Vivien Heilbron, just 26 at the time. More than 50 years later, she is still happy to talk about the role.",
      "\"I'm very, very proud of all three programmes. I'm proud to be associated with it and it is by far the most interesting character I've every played on television,\" she says.",
      "\"I've done some nice things and had very good parts, but that was something kind of iconic, I think.\"",
      "James Naughtie has voiced the trails for the programme's latest broadcast and believes the series more than lived up to the book.",
      "\"The TV adaptation was, I think, quite an enlightened thing because the book wasn't well enough known. I mean, it was known fairly well but it hadn't become a kind of touchstone for modern Scottish writing in the way that it has since,\" he says.",
      "Sunset Song has been remastered. The original film was digitised, 50 years of dirt and dust removed and the picture regraded to resemble as much as possible its original look.",
      "Vivien says: \"I'm absolutely thrilled. A lot of people really loved it and seem to want to see it again and I am hoping that a lot of people will watch it this time who have never seen it before.",
      "\"Sunset Song is always the favourite one but I think that Cloud Howe and Grey Granite are also terrific novels and Bill Craig made such a beautiful job of all three adaptations.",
      "\"I'm sure if Lewis Grassic Gibbon could see them he would have approved.\"",
      "The TV drama was credited with reigniting interest in Grassic Gibbon, and Sunset Song was put on the Higher English syllabus. In 2016, it was voted Scotland's favourite book in a BBC poll.",
      "In an introduction to the novel published in 2020, the then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote of her love for the book, which she said is her favourite novel.",

      "\"I don't think you can think of anything more modern than some of the statements that Lewis Grassic Gibbon makes about mankind. I mean, human nature doesn't change a great deal,\" she says.",

      "The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band synonymous with LA, also took the stage to mark the evening. The Grammys audience sang along with Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis in an impromptu performance of their hit \"Under the Bridge\" - about Los Angeles.",
      "LA firefighters also took the stage during the show. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone spoke before the group and told the audience: \"I am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\"",
      "Then firefighters presented the biggest award of the night - album of the year - with Beyonc\u00e9 winning the elusive honour after four losses in the category over the years.",
      "Fundraising efforts",
      "Nearly every commercial break during the show included a nod to the fires that happened here. Footage of burned down neighbourhoods or an inside look at a skate shop or small business that was destroyed in the blazes.",
      "Host Trevor Noah made mention of the fundraising effort throughout the show - acknowledging big donations that were made. He noted at one point during the broadcast that at least $7 million (\u00a35.7m) had been donated thus far.",
      "Much of the red carpet was plastered with fundraising signs and backdrops with QR codes to a Grammys website where people can donate.",
      "As celebrities strolled along the red carpet, groups of firefighters and first responders also took their walk before the media.",
      "They were greeted by loud applause and thank yous from everyone they passed. Many smiled and took selfies in their uniforms, some even nabbing pictures with celebrities.",
      "One firefighter's jaw dropped when he saw the Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi and they took a picture together.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Captain Joshua Swaney walked alongside fellow firefighters on the red carpet. He told the BBC that while it was a phenomenal experience being honoured at the event, it was a helpful reminder for the rest of the world that LA is still reeling.",
      "\"This is definitely not what we're used to. That's for sure. It's been a humbling experience to be a part of this,\" he said. \"We are here making sure that people know that there's so much more to Los Angeles than just what's currently happening right now.\"",
      "To cancel the show or not?",
      "The Recording Academy, which runs the show, had said the show was needed more than ever.",
      "Showrunners sought to strike the right tone honouring the victims of the fire and displaying a defiant Los Angeles that will persevere. But there was concern the optics of rich celebrities dolled up with smiles on a red carpet could come off as tone deaf.",
      "Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. highlighted the economic impact, noting that thousands rely on Grammy-related work, particularly in the service industry. He framed the event as a symbol of resilience, arguing that cancelling would not benefit the city or music industry.",
      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast before the show. The show will be \"unifying and coming together, honouring music, but also using the power of music to heal, rebuild and provide services to people who need it\".",
      "\"I think this might be one of the most important Grammy weeks we've ever had.\"",
      "Mr Mason told the New York Times that they consulted a range of public officials about whether they should hold the event - including the city's mayor and California Governor Gavin Newsom - and whether it would hinder fire response efforts.",
      "\"They strongly suggested that we continue forward with hosting the event,\" he told the outlet. \"Everyone said there's nothing good that comes from postponing.\"",
      "But there were still worries that the night will be a bad look for the music industry.",
      "\"I actually don't think that the Grammys should be happening,\" Elyn Kazarian, a creative director in the music industry, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's just very weird to me that there are going to be celebrities on a red carpet wearing expensive clothes while people in other parts of the city are suffering and whose livelihoods have been destroyed.\"",

      "This is not the first time a major disruption has impacted the music industry's biggest night.",
      "In 2021, the show was postponed due to Covid-19 and was significantly altered to accommodate safety protocols. It featured a socially distanced format, with no live audience and pre-recorded performances in an intimate outdoor setting rather than the usual large-scale arena production.",
      "Artists had to adjust to a new way of promoting their music, relying on digital platforms rather than in-person Grammy week events, which were either cancelled or moved online.",
      "\"I wouldn't necessarily compare the COVID pandemic to what's happening here,\" senior music writer for Variety, Steven J Horowitz, told the BBC. \"COVID lasted for so long and the effects were devastating for years. People had to cancel major releases, and everything shifted to a digital space.\"",
      "He said the fires are different.",
      "\"The industry has reacted in real time. It's not as widespread as a worldwide pandemic, so people are a little more flexible on how to properly react and help those affected,\" he said.",

      "\"I know multiple musicians who lost their gear\", Chavez said. \"I know stylists who work in music who lost their houses, who had costumes and whatnot. I know musicians who are born and raised in LA who lost their house.\"",
      "There is also a ripple effect in the industry on those not personally impacted by the fires.",
      "The week of events typically held before the show, which were cancelled this year to help with fundraising efforts instead, helps new musicians and allows them to break out in a crowded market - getting time with top executives and those at major record labels.",
      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",
      "\"Say you're a Best New Artist nominee who is relatively unknown to the public - being on these platforms and at these parties is a really big look if you're trying to get your music out in front of the industry. It really does help.\"",
      "One of the most sought-after parties is Spotify's event honouring the nominees for Best New Artist of the year. It is half party, half concert, with previous nominees showcasing their new music, and celebrities from all parts of the entertainment industry there to celebrate.",
      "Following the fires, Spotify chose to cancel this year's event.",
      "\"We've decided that the most impactful approach is cancelling all our Grammy Week events, including our annual Best New Artist party, and redirecting funds to support efforts to reach local fans and charitable organizations,\" Spotify's Global Head of Music Partnerships and Audience Joe Hadley wrote in an announcement.",
      "The music industry and the Grammys are deeply rooted in Los Angeles, and though the city is going through a devastating period, it has reinforced a sense of community, especially in the music industry.",
      "\"Even if people lost everything, they still have hope. And I think that feeds into what we're going to see in the music industry in the future,\" Mr Horowitz said. \"People aren't going to flee Los Angeles because of this one thing. It's not going to stop L.A. from being one of the main hubs for music in the world.\"",

      "Sunday night saw Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar win big at the Grammy Awards, which was dedicated to fundraising for wildfire relief efforts in Los Angeles.",
      "It also saw plenty of memorable performances, impassioned speeches and stunning red carpet looks for everyone to emulate over the course of the next year (leather chaps are back, in case you were wondering).",

      "HIGHLIGHT: Beyonc\u00e9 wins album of the year... At last",
      "Well, now we're in a pickle.",
      "On her eighth solo record, Cowboy Carter, Beyonc\u00e9 sang about the Grammys' constant, stubborn refusal to award her album of the year.",
      "\"AOTY, I ain't win,\" she sang. \"Take that s--- on the chin.\"",
      "But now she has won, for the album that contains that very lyric. Will she have to go back and re-record it? At the very least, we expect a rewrite on the tour she just announced.",
      "Joking aside, this victory was long, long overdue.",
      "In 2017, Adele even flirted with the idea of handing back her album of the year trophy, saying the music on her album, 25, couldn't compare to Beyonc\u00e9's \"monumental\u2026 beautiful and soul-baring\" Lemonade.",
      "Eyebrows were raised again in 2023, when Harry Styles' fun, but conceptually flimsy, Harry's House bested Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance \u2013 a meticulous exploration of how oppressed black and queer musicians found salvation through house music.",
      "In the end, it took Beyonc\u00e9 to approach a genre that conservative Grammy voters could understand \u2013 country \u2013 in order to secure a victory.",
      "But that's not to downplay the scale of her achievement. Cowboy Carter is a masterpiece that weaves hundreds of musical threads into a thesis about America's cultural past, and the futility of gatekeeping musical genres along racial lines.",
      "The arguments it makes are both timely and urgent, without suffocating the songs.",
      "As the second part of a planned trilogy, this surely won't be Beyonc\u00e9's last trip to the podium.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Sabrina Carpenter's stage malfunction",
      "Sabrina Carpenter has literally been practising for this moment all her life. She made her TV debut in 2011, aged 12 years old, and has been hovering on the fringes of pop superstardom pretty much ever since.",
      "So, after a huge breakthrough in 2024, she was primed and ready for the Grammy stage.",
      "Or was she?",
      "She emerged in a razzle-dazzle showgirl outfit and instantly missed her spotlight. Then she dropped the cane she was supposed to dance with. And, as she descended a grand pearlescent staircase, she suddenly disappeared through a trap door.",
      "Luckily, it was all a humorous ruse! Carpenter skipped back to the stage for a big band version of Espresso, complete with ankle-endangering tap routine.",
      "After changing into a blue, crystal-studded Victoria's Secret bodysuit, she segued effortlessly into Please, Please, Please\u2026 And then the set collapsed on her.",
      "As she leapt into the safety of a dancer's arms, she couldn't contain her laughter.",
      "It was a perfect piece of vaudeville, and the audience lapped it up. Host Trevor Noah, however, wasn't so impressed.",
      "\"That was amazing and funny, which I didn't appreciate,\" the comedian said. \"Really, Sabrina? You're just gonna take my job like that?\"",

      "Among those people were Abel Tesfaye \u2013 aka The Weeknd himself.",
      "He declared the awards were \"corrupt\" and criticised their lack of \"transparency\". Since then, he's refused to submit any of his music for consideration.",
      "So it was something of a coup when he gave an unannounced, unexpected performance in the middle of Sunday's ceremony.",
      "He was introduced by the Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who acknowledged the star's criticisms, and described his efforts to revamp the Grammys' electorate, by boosting the number of women and people of colour.",
      "After that, the star took to the stage with two songs from his brand new album, Cry For Me and Timeless.",
      "It was meant to be a celebration of people's ability to learn and grow, but the music was so oppressively drab \u2013 with the Weeknd constantly shrouded in smoke and shadow -  that you wondered whether he'd simply returned to sabotage the Grammys from within.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Chappell Roan rides a big pink pony",
      "BBC Sound of 2025 winner Chappell Roan cantered into the Grammys with a theatrical performance of Pink Pony Club - her love letter to LA, as well as a celebration of queer discovery.",
      "Backed by dancers dressed as rodeo clowns, Roan - herself wearing a sequinned cowboy hat and sparkly boots - rode a a giant pink carousel pony, complete with an 80s perm.",
      "\"'My Little Pony' grew up!\" joked host Trevor Noah afterwards.",

      "The pair then made a swift exit, electing to skip the ceremony, driving off into the LA night.",
      "Early reports suggested they had been kicked out, but the BBC understands they left of their own accord, with one source saying that West, \"walked the carpet, got in his car and left\".",
      "They may well have been home by the time West's track Carnival lost out to Kendrick Lamar in the best rap song category.",
      "But he probably won't mind: He already has 24 Grammy awards, and now he has the headlines he craves, too.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Brat Green picks up a prize",
      "Among the three awards Charli XCX picked up was one of the night's most obscure: Best artwork.",
      "At first glance, that might seem odd. The album cover is a plain green square, with the word \"brat\" printed in a deliberately low-resolution Arial font.",
      "But the cover took five months to put together, with designer Brent David Freaney testing around 500 shades of green to produce a garish, nausea-inducing effect.",
      "Charli wanted the artwork to be deliberately off-putting \u2013 reflecting the album's dual themes of partying and self doubt. And she said it was important to challenge the convention of women dressing provocatively to promote their music.",
      "\"Why should anyone have that level of ownership over female artists?\" she asked Vogue magazine.",
      "She added: \"I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture - why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad?",
      "\"I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice.\"",
      "Towards the end of the ceremony, the star's live performance of Von Dutch and Guess saw her transform the biggest and glitziest night in music into a packed and sweaty nightclub.",
      "Emerging from a black SUV, she strutted towards the camera, throwing a glass of champagne against the wall of a parking garage, before launching into what appeared to be an underground rave.",
      "As the performance progressed, she appeared on stage with model Julia Fox and hundreds of dancers, who were then showered in underwear (a reference to the song's lyrics).",

      "LOWLIGHT (if you\u2019re Drake): Kendrick Lamar\u2019s clean sweep",
      "The Grammys have a wobbly history with hip-hop. They didn't introduce a rap category until 1989, a full decade after the Sugarhill Gang introduced the genre to a wide audience with Rapper's Delight. And no rap act has won album of the year since OutKast in 2001.",
      "So it was a rare victory when Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar won all five of the awards in which he was nominated for Not Like Us, a furious takedown of his musical rival, Drake.",
      "Among those awards were the prestigious record and song of the year - categories that have only ever recognised a rap song once before (Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019).",
      "Lamar didn't perform at the ceremony - he plays the Super Bowl halftime show next week instead - but, dressed head to toe in denim, he delivered a powerful message to Grammy voters.",
      "\"At the end of the day, nothing is more powerful than rap music. I don't care what it is. We are the culture\u2026 respect the art form\".",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Janelle Mona\u00e9's moonwalk moment",
      "Music lost one of its biggest legends in 2024, when Quincy Jones died at the age of 91.",
      "As the producer for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, the Grammys gave him a star-studded send-off that lasted almost 20 minutes.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock played a beautiful version of Fly Me To The Moon; while Stevie Wonder's sang We Are The World with choirs from two schools affected by the devastating LA fires.",
      "But it was Janelle Mona\u00e9's performance of Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough that blew the roof off.",
      "Dressed in MJ's Billie Jean outfit, she pirouetted and moonwalked and jumped on the tables as if she'd been possessed by the man himself.",
      "Towards the end of the performance, she threw off her jacket to reveal a t-shirt bearing the legend \"I Love QJ\".",
      "And guess who caught it and wore it for the rest of the night?",
      "Taylor Swift.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Snubs for Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift",
      "Even with 94 awards to consider, some people will get overlooked - but nobody expected two of the Grammys' biggest darlings to go home empty-handed.",
      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",
      "Don't count either of these artists out just yet.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Trevor Noah's easy-going hosting",
      "There's a reason they keep inviting Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys: He's got the tone right.",
      "He's relaxed, he's engaged with the music, and his humour never punches down.",
      "Here are some of his best quips from the night:",
      "\"Yesterday, Beyonce announced her new tour. Everyone saw that. I will say, though, Beyonce, there's tariffs. We can't afford a new tour, right?

Which means she would break the record of four wins, set all the way back in 2024 by Taylor Swift. I'm just gonna say Taylor, if you break Taylor's record, the Swifties are gonna come for you. And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years. So good luck to the Beatles. I think if they win, this could open up a few doors for them.\"\"And who knows, through the power of AI, one day, we could even get another Rihanna album.\"",

    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "story": [
      "Triple killer Valdo Calocane was not forced to take his anti-psychotic medication in part because he did not like needles, a major review of his NHS care has revealed.",
      "The detail was published among a catalogue of failings identified by an independent report, which revealed \"the system got it wrong\" with Calocane, who stabbed to death Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates in Nottingham in June 2023.",
      "It laid out how Calocane, who has paranoid schizophrenia, had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings - after he was discharged when he repeatedly failed to engage with them.",
      "Mr Webber's mother Emma described the report as a \"horror show\".",
      "In response, the government repeated its commitment to a public inquiry into the attacks, with work ongoing to establish its scope.",
      "The NHS said it had taken the decision to publish the report in full, in line with the wishes of the families, and \"given the level of detail already in the public domain\".",
      "The independent review, by Theemis Consulting, looked into the treatment given to Calocane by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust prior to the killings, as well as the interactions the NHS had with other agencies involved in his care.",
      "The key findings of the report include:",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's careThe voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatmentOther patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"",
      "There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's care",
      "The voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatment",
      "Other patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023",
      "Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "The case, which resulted in Calocane being sentenced to a hospital order in January 2024, sparked a number of reviews including the mental health homicide review, commissioned by NHS England.",
      "Another, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is looking into both Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire Police.",
      "A review into the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocane's pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better.",
      "And in May, a judge ruled Calocane's sentence was not unduly lenient.",
      "Speaking after the release of the new report on Wednesday, Mrs Webber said: \"It's been additional trauma, horror, disbelief and fury - but all of that was anticipated and expected by all three families.\"",
      "She added: \"It leaves us feeling horrified, heartbroken, but even more determined now to make sure that it's addressed - that the government and the agencies react and listen properly.\"",
      "Mrs Webber also revealed she had been contacted by the family of one of the Southport stabbing victims.",
      "\"It's very rare that you can say to someone 'I know how dreadful that is' and know that that person really does know,\" she said.",
      "In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Coates's son James said the main focus was to keep working to make sure mistakes were not repeated.",
      "\"I know my father would be proud of me to keep fighting,\" he said.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the government had worked with NHS England to ensure the report was published in full.",
      "\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" he said. \"The findings will help to support an inquiry into this attack and we'll set out the next steps as this develops.\"",
      "He added he had called for all the recommendations made in a previous Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the case to be implemented across the country.",
      "The new report also sets out the contact Calocane had with mental health services before he killed Mr Webber, Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates, and then stole Mr Coates's van before driving it into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - all of whom were seriously injured.",
      "The report states the former University of Nottingham student first came into contact with mental health services on 24 May 2020, when he was 28, when he was arrested for criminal damage to a neighbour's flat.",
      "It was documented that Calocane's behaviour was an episode of psychosis brought on by the stress of course work and a forthcoming exam, coupled with a lack of sleep.",
      "Shortly after returning to his home, Calocane again tried to gain access to a neighbour's flat. His neighbour was so frightened that she jumped from a first-floor window, sustaining back injuries which required surgery.",
      "Calocane was then detained for the first time under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which meant he could be kept in hospital against his will for up to 28 days - known as a \"section\".",
      "Subsequent contacts with services saw him labelled as having paranoid schizophrenia.",
      "After about a month in hospital, Calocane was sent home with reviews expected from the community crisis team and the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service.",
      "He was initially called by the crisis team. The contact was a phone call rather than a face-to-face appointment \"because of Covid-19 restrictions at the time\".",
      "His family expressed concerns because they felt he could \"play down his symptoms\" over the phone.",
      "In July 2020, Calocane was admitted to hospital for a second time after forcibly entering a neighbour's flat.",
      "He was sectioned again, this time under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, which allows for a longer hospital stay of up to six months.",
      "According to medical records shared by Calocane's family with BBC Panorama, while Calocane was ill in hospital, a psychiatrist observed that \"there seems to be no insight or remorse and the danger is that this will happen again and perhaps Valdo will end up killing someone\".",
      "Two weeks after this entry was made, Calocane was discharged from Highbury Hospital.",
      "According to the report, his family \"felt this was a real missed opportunity to fully understand [Calocane's] diagnosis, risk and to get to grips with a treatment plan that [Calocane] was concordant with\".",
      "Three months before his third hospital admission in August 2021, Calocane's family again reported concerns over his mental health.",
      "At the end of August, his care co-ordinator visited him at home with a colleague, noting that he was no longer taking his medication and had no intention of continuing treatment.",
      "A month later, the report said he had \"significantly assaulted\" police officers who attended in support of a Mental Health Act assessment.",
      "On a number of occasions, his care co-ordinator had suggested the use of depot medication - which releases slowly over time meaning patients need to administer medications less frequently.",
      "But, the report said, the inpatient teams were trying to treat him \"in the least restrictive way\", and took on board his reasons for not wanting to take injectable depot medication, \"which included him not liking needles\".",
      "After multiple missed appointments, in January 2022, officials contemplated discharging Calocane from the EIP service due to a lack of engagement.",
      "But the following day, the EIP learned Calocane had trapped two housemates in their flat, which resulted in the police being called.",
      "He was assessed under the Mental Health Act, but not detained.",
      "Calocane was admitted to hospital at the end of January 2022 for almost a month - his fourth hospital admission.",
      "After being discharged, it was noted that none of Calocane's care providers should visit him at home alone because of his \"history of violence and aggression\".",
      "Calocane then missed a few appointments to collect his medication over the coming months, and a new care co-ordinator tried to contact him multiple times.",
      "After these failed attempts, a decision was taken in September 2022 to discharge Calocane from the EIP service to his GP.",
      "The report said \"opportunities to assertively try to reach out to [Calocane] when he disengaged from services were limited\" because of pressures in the team.",
      "\"Due to multiple factors, including workload, the discharge system did not function as intended,\" the report said.",
      "'Watershed moment'",
      "It added there was no contact between Calocane and mental health services, or his GP, for roughly nine months from this time until the killings.",
      "Dr Jessica Sokolov, regional medical director at NHS England (Midlands), said it was \"clear the system got it wrong\" and apologised to the victims \"on behalf of the NHS and the organisations involved\" in Calocane's care.",
      "Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said the organisation had asked every mental health trust to review the report findings.",
      "Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, said the publication of the review \"should act as a watershed moment revealing the truth and honouring the needs of the families of victims of homicides by people with mental illness or disorder\".",
      "In a statement, Calocane's family said they were \"deeply sorry\" for \"this horrific tragedy\".",
      "They said: \"The report confirms what we and many others have known for a while: the mental healthcare system is in crisis and in need of immediate intervention, which we believe must come from the government. It is not enough to say that the NHS failed; we must be honest in recognising that the NHS has been set up for failure, and cannot be left to fix itself on its own.\"",
      "The chief executive of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Ifti Majid, added: \"We apologise unreservedly for the opportunities we missed in the care of Valdo Calocane and accept the Theemis report in its entirety including its findings and recommendations.",
      "\"We are making clear progress with a trust-wide plan, which is already delivering key improvements in areas such as risk assessment and discharge processes.\"",

      "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.",
      "Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.",
      "BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).",
      "One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.",
      "Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.",
      "Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.",
      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",
      "We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.",
      "Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.",
      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",

      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",

    "story": [
      "Child killer Lucy Letby did not murder any babies, a panel of international medical experts reviewing evidence in her case has claimed.",
      "Chairman Dr Shoo Lee told a press conference \"in all cases death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care\".",
      "Letby, who is serving 15 whole life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between 2015 and 2016, has already lost two bids to appeal against her convictions.",
      "The panel's findings are likely to form part of an application which has been made by her lawyers to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for her case to be investigated as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The lengthy and medically technical press conference was organised by Letby's legal team who had said the panel would present \"significant new medical evidence\".",
      "Dr Lee, a Canadian neonatal care expert, said there were alternative explanations for each of Letby's convictions for murder or attempted murder.",
      "He said he became involved in the case after learning that an academic paper he co-authored on air embolism, one of the methods Letby was said to have used to attack babies, had formed part of the prosecution case in her trial.",
      "Dr Lee said the 14 experts, including medical professionals from Canada, the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and the UK, had looked at 17 cases at the heart of Letby's prosecution and had compiled an \"impartial evidence-based report\".",
      "The report presented at the conference was a summary of the panel's findings, and the full report would be submitted to Letby's legal team, Dr Lee said.",
      "Dr Lee provided what he said were highly detailed grounds baby-by-baby for concluding that none of the murders occurred.",
      "He added: \"We did not find any murders. In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.\"",
      "\"Lucy was charged with seven murders and seven attempted murders\", he said.",
      "\"In our opinion, the medical opinion, the medical evidence doesn't support murder in any of these babies.",
      "\"Our full report will go to Lucy's barrister later this month, and then it'll be up to him and the courts to decide what next to do.\"",
      "During Letby's trial, the prosecution referred to the 1989 paper by Dr Lee that looked at cases of air embolus, referring to injuries caused when air is injected into a baby's arteries or veins after staff at the Countess of Chester reported skin discoloration on some of the babies.",
      "In the cases Dr Lee analysed in his paper, those injuries had happened accidentally.",
      "The prosecution argued that one of the methods Letby used to injure or kill babies was to inject air into their veins and used Dr Lee's paper to back that claim.",
      "In the paper, Dr Lee described a distinct discoloration on the babies' skin in 10% of cases.",
      "'Scrutinised'",
      "However, at the press conference Dr Lee said in all of the cases in his paper air was injected into the babies' arteries, not their veins.",
      "He said that the skin discolouration described in the paper was not possible when air was injected into the veins.",
      "Dr Lee said he had recently updated his academic paper and found no cases of skin discolouration linked to air embolism by the venous system.",
      "He prefaced his remarks by saying that the thoughts of each panel member were with the families of the babies who had died.",
      "Former neonatal nurse Letby, now 35, lost two bids to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal last year.",
      "The prosecution's medical case was scrutinised by the Court of Appeal in May last year and found to be safe - and the judges noted Letby herself did not present any experts at her trial offering an alternative view.",
      "Dr Lee had offered to give evidence to the Court of Appeal as part of Letby's application for permission to appeal, but three senior judges said his conclusions did not undermine her convictions.",
      "The judges concluded there had been no prosecution expert evidence diagnosing air embolus solely on the basis of skin discolouration.",
      "Earlier, the CCRC said Letby's lawyers had applied to the commission to investigate her case as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The body said it would now assess the application and determine whether there was new evidence which presented a reasonable chance of a conviction being overturned.",
      "A CCRC spokesperson said: \"We are aware that there has been a great deal of speculation and commentary surrounding Lucy Letby's case, much of it from parties with only a partial view of the evidence.",
      "\"We ask that everyone remembers the families affected by events at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.\"",
      "Mark McDonald, Letby's barrister, said that because her previous legal team had not called a medical expert at her trial, the information presented was \"new, fresh evidence\".",
      "He said the nurse was convicted because of the medical evidence, and if that was wrong any circumstantial evidence would \"fall away\".",
      "\"The most important thing, the reason why Lucy Letby was convicted, was because of the medical evidence that was presented to the jury that today has been demolished,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:21:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The gene therapy Casgevy, which will now be offered to some patients in England, could help people live disease-free, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease, with a price tag of \u00a31.65m, is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England.",
      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",
      "Asiawu Imam, 26, lives in London, where she works as a nurse looking after people who have sickle cell disorder. She also lives with the condition.",
      "When she was younger she was in and out of hospital three to four times a year with painful sickle cell crises.",
      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",
      "The therapy being made available on the NHS gives her hope, and a sense to the community that people with the condition are being taken seriously.",
      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",
      "It is already being given to patients in other countries such as France, Germany and Italy.",
      "Wales is also expected to provide it in the next few months."

      "Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite.",
      "\"I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,\" she says.",
      "When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more \"comfortable and casual\", she says.",
      "Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening \"for at least two years\" because of concerns about pain.",

      "Jessica Tse was \"really anxious\" before her cervical screening in December.",
      "\"I didn't know if it was going to hurt\", she says.",
      "But the nurse was \"talking to me, distracting me throughout\" and explained the procedure \"really clearly\", she adds.",

      "But \"it was over before I knew\", she says.",
      "Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton.",
      "\"It was nothing,\" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. \"I couldn't feel anything.\" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.",
      "\"These nurses have seen everything,\" Megan adds.",

      "Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations.",
      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",
      "But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot.",
      "What is it like to have the test as a transgender man?",
      "Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was \"incredibly supportive\" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening.",
      "Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings.",
      "Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot.",

      "Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix.",

      "Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years.",
      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",

      "A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper.",
      "Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware.",
      "Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for.",
      "Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter.",
      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Nuclear power provides around 15% of the UK's electricity but many of the country's ageing reactors are due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "The plans announced on Thursday will mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built will also be scrapped. The list was made up of just eight sites.",
      "Sir Keir said Britain's energy security had been \"held hostage\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"too long\", which has resulted in prices \"skyrocketing at his whims\".",
      "\"I'm putting an end to it - changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long,\" he explained.",
      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",

      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",

      "Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the union has repeatedly said \"there can be no net zero without new nuclear\".",

      "The government has not yet made a final decision on Sizewell C, which is not due to come until the spending review later this year. The final choice on the design of the SMRs will also come at the same time.",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years. Consultations for Sizewell took 10 years alone.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:08:55 GMT",
    "summary": "A cut to interest rates could mean lower mortgage rates.",
    "story": [
      "Interest rates are expected to be cut by the Bank of England later, in a move closely watched by households and economists.",
      "Analysts predict the benchmark rate will be cut from 4.75% to 4.5%, given the recent weakness in the UK economy which has seen slow growth.",
      "The Bank rate is the primary tool aimed at controlling inflation, and hopes of a cut rose after the inflation rate - which charts the rising cost of living - fell to 2.5% in the year to December.",
      "However, it remains above the Bank's target of 2%, and changes in the Budget are forecast to push it up.",
      "Economic uncertainty has been heightened, owing to US President Donald Trump's introduction, or threat, of import tariffs. They could lead to inflationary pressure globally, causing a knock-on effect on price rises in the UK.",
      "Why do interest rates change?",
      "The Bank moves rates up and down to try to control inflation, which measures the pace of overall price rises.",
      "By raising rates, borrowing is made more expensive, so people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows the rate at which prices are rising.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy as it discourages businesses from investing and creating more jobs.",
      "Once price rises are more under control, then the Bank will consider lowering interest rates.",
      "Its base interest rate heavily influences the rates High Street banks and other money lenders charge customers for loans, credit cards and other finance deals.",
      "This is most obviously seen in the cost of mortgages. Reducing the base rate would see an immediate impact for those on \"tracker\" mortgages.",
      "About 629,000 mortgage-holders have tracker deals. Typically, their monthly repayment would fall by about \u00a329 as a result of the expected 0.25 percentage point cut later.",
      "A similar number of householders have variable rate deals, and lenders will be under pressure to cut their rates if the Bank reduces the base rate.",
      "Fixed rate deals do not change immediately, but the expectation of further rate cuts could lead to new, or renewing, borrowers getting a better deal.",
      "Savers would be hit by a base rate fall, as the return they receive from banks would also be likely to be cut.",
      "'Gradual approach'",
      "In December, when rates were held at 4.75%, the Bank's Governor, Andrew Bailey, said it would take a \"gradual approach to future interest rate cuts\".",
      "But he added: \"We can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year.\"",
      "In the minutes from that meeting, the Bank said there was uncertainty \"around how the measures that had been announced in the autumn Budget were affecting growth\".",
      "Following November's meeting, Mr Bailey would not be drawn on the impact of Trump tariffs on the UK economy, saying \"let's wait and see\".",
      "In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has indicated it will cut rates at a slower pace this year.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "When the Bank announces its interest rates decision at 12:00 it will also share a report on where it sees inflation going in the coming months and could hint at its strategy in response.",
      "Cutting the UK interest rate would strike a balance between \"supporting an economy that appears to have ground to a complete halt and preventing inflation from taking off again\", economist Paul Dales from Capital Economics told the BBC.",
      "\"Trump's tariffs are unlikely to influence UK interest rates much,\" he added, but wage growth being faster than the Bank's forecast could influence its decision.",
      "The UK economy grew by less than expected in November, after not growing at all in the previous two months. A further slowdown is expected as businesses brace for rising costs from April because of budgetary changes like rising National Insurance contributions and higher minimum wages.",

      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",
      "He said the idea of a grey belt had initially \"intrigued\" committee members who believed it could \"make a positive contribution\" to meeting housing targets.",
      "Some councils ordered to increase home building by 400%, new BBC tracker shows",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Housing plans not war on rural England, says minister",
      "What is the 'grey belt' and how many homes could Labour build on it?",
      "However, he said that changes announced in the National Planning and Policy Framework (NPPF) would mean that the impact of the grey belt would be \"at best, marginal\".",
      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",
      "\"In the realm of decision-taking they are already playing a key role in the outcome of appeals where green belt land is considered by inspectors to be grey belt.",

    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",
      "Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn.",

      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",

      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",

      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "title": "Record January warmth puzzles climate scientists",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "title": "UK to make it easier to build nuclear reactors",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:56:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The process of loosening rules on where reactors could be built began under the previous government.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced plans to make it easier to build mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales, as part of its efforts to boost UK economic growth.",
      "It said it will reform the \"archaic\" planning rules which ministers believe have held Britain back in the global race for clean, secure and affordable energy.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the country had been \"let down and left behind\" because it had not built a nuclear power station in \"decades\" - and the plans will create thousands of highly skilled jobs.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Nuclear power provides around 15% of the UK's electricity but many of the country's ageing reactors are due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "The plans announced on Thursday will mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built will also be scrapped. The list was made up of just eight sites.",
      "Sir Keir said Britain's energy security had been \"held hostage\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"too long\", which has resulted in prices \"skyrocketing at his whims\".",
      "\"I'm putting an end to it - changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long,\" he explained.",
      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",
      "The head of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, called the reforms the \"strongest signal yet\" towards growth and clean power.",
      "Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the union has repeatedly said \"there can be no net zero without new nuclear\".",
      "Referring to Sizewell C, the site on the Suffolk coast on which then prime minister Boris Johnson pledged a new nuclear reactor on in 2022, he added: \"[It] stands ready and waiting for the green light to power up our country's future.\"",
      "The government has not yet made a final decision on Sizewell C, which is not due to come until the spending review later this year. The final choice on the design of the SMRs will also come at the same time.",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years. Consultations for Sizewell took 10 years alone.",

    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",

      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",

      "The Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.",
      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",

      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

      "A Scottish scheme was originally meant to be operational by 2023 but was delayed after objections from businesses to the inclusion of glass.",
      "It then emerged that the UK government was considering blocking Scotland's plans because it wanted a single scheme for all four nations.",
      "UK ministers eventually decided they would grant an exemption - but only if glass was taken out of the Scottish plans to align it with the scheme it was planning to introduce in England.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:45:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",

      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",

      "British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.",
      "There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",

      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers.

      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries was amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",
      "The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.",
      "But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely.",
      "As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.",
      "Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.",

      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",
      "He said Dynasty Warriors' future was about \"getting the most\" out of current consoles - perhaps with even more enemies on screen.",
      "Though he laughed off the suggestion that perhaps the studio should consider collaborating on the ultimate \"spin-off\" - a Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",
      "And Mr Sho said if he could make any Dynasty Warriors spin-off, there are two series he's huge fans of - Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",
      "\"If there is a chance, I'd definitely love to take on the challenge,\" he said."

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:01:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Some people didn't expect it to last a year. Here's how the popular life simulator has stayed alive.",
    "story": [
      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",
      "\"That's been so wonderful that I have been able to tell my stories and connect with people and they can see themselves represented,\" she says.",
      "The Sims has come in for more criticism over the years for its racial representation.",
      "American content creator Amira, known as Xmiramira online, created a custom skin tone pack for The Sims 4 that's still used by many players today.",
      "\"I couldn't make Sims that either look similar to me or my family, friends. And that's the case in a lot of games,\" says Amira.",
      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",
      "While The Sims is often seen as a leader when it comes to inclusivity in gaming, some people are uncomfortable with its approach.",
      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",
      "It has added certain features - such as visible hearing aids - to improve the representation of disability in the game.",
      "Press X to sniff: Can smelling a game make it more immersive?",
      "Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft praised at gaming accessibility awards",
      "Cher Lloyd on making new music, Swagger Jagger and Liam Payne's unmatched talent",
      "As The Sims celebrates its anniversary, the new US government has introduced policies to scale back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "Critics argue these schemes are discriminatory and used to push political agendas, while supporters argue that they work to combat inequalities.",
      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",
      "\"The bigger concern is that this will be seen as a green light for certain groups of toxic gamers to become more open about their own hateful views, making inclusive spaces more important than ever,\" says Zoe.",
      "Simmer Amira says it's especially important for a life simulation game such as The Sims to include as many people as possible.",
      "\"Everybody should be able to, for the most part, make themselves with little to no issue,\" she says.",
      "Jesse adds: \"A lot of people don't get to experience things that other cultures experience and it's a really great way to implement learning about it in everyday life.",
      "\"I think that goes a long way to acceptance as well.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad.

      "Yet it was entirely written by AI, with a few simple prompts about me supplied by my friend Janet.",
      "It's an interesting read, and very funny in parts. But it also meanders quite a lot, and is somewhere between a self-help book and a stream of anecdotes.",
      "It mimics my chatty style of writing, but it's also a bit repetitive, and very verbose. It may have gone beyond Janet's prompts in collating data about me.",
      "Several sentences begin \"as a leading technology journalist\u2026\" \u2013 cringe \u2013 which could have been scraped from an online bio.",

      "There is currently no barrier to anyone creating one in anybody's name, including celebrities \u2013 although Mr Mashiach says there are guardrails around abusive content. Each book contains a printed disclaimer stating that it is fictional, created by AI, and designed \"solely to bring humour and joy\".",
      "Legally, the copyright belongs to the firm, but Mr Mashiach stresses that the product is intended as a \"personalised gag gift\", and the books do not get sold further.",
      "He hopes to broaden his range, generating different genres such as sci-fi, and perhaps offering an autobiography service. It's designed to be a light-hearted form of consumer AI \u2013 selling AI-generated goods to human customers.",
      "It's also a bit terrifying if, like me, you write for a living. Not least because it probably took less than a minute to generate, and it does, certainly in some parts, sound just like me.",
      "Musicians, authors, artists and actors worldwide have expressed alarm about their work being used to train generative AI tools that then churn out similar content based upon it.",

      "\"This is books, this is articles, this is photos. It's works of art. It's records\u2026 The whole point of AI training is to learn how to do something and then do more like that.\"",

It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

      "But this has now been repealed by Trump. It remains to be seen what Trump will do instead, but he is said to want the AI sector to face less regulation.",
      "This comes as a number of lawsuits against AI firms, and particularly against OpenAI, continue in the US. They have been taken out by everyone from the New York Times to authors, music labels, and even a comedian.",
      "They claim that the AI firms broke the law when they took their content from the internet without their consent, and used it to train their systems.",
      "The AI companies argue that their actions fall under \"fair use\" and are therefore exempt. There are a number of factors which can constitute fair use \u2013 it's not a straight-forward definition. But the AI sector is under increasing scrutiny over how it gathers training data and whether it should be paying for it.",
      "If this wasn't all enough to ponder, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has shaken the sector over the past week. It became the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store.",
      "DeepSeek claims that it developed its technology for a fraction of the price of the likes of OpenAI. Its success has raised security concerns in the US, and threatens American's current dominance of the sector.",
      "As for me and a career as an author, I think that at the moment, if I really want a \"bestseller\" I'll still have to write it myself. If anything, Tech-Splaining for Dummies highlights the current weakness in generative AI tools for bigger projects. It is full of inaccuracies and hallucinations, and it can be quite difficult to read in parts because it's so long-winded.",

      "President Donald Trump's suggestion the US could \"take over\" and \"own\" Gaza, resettling its population in the process, has been met with shock and condemnation.",
      "The comments come as a ceasefire is under way between Hamas and Israel, and amid questions about Gaza's post-conflict future.",
      "The UN estimates around two thirds of buildings there have been destroyed or damaged after 15 months of fighting.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the idea was \"worth paying attention to\" but it has been roundly rejected by Arab nations and some US allies.",
      "Why did Donald Trump say this now?",
      "If Donald Trump is right about one thing, it is that decades of US diplomacy on Israel and the Palestinians have failed to resolve the conflict.",
      "Peace proposals and presidents have come and gone but the problems have festered. Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the war in Gaza it triggered were the hideous results.",
      "Trump made his millions as a property developer and, with that hat on, made a perfectly valid observation: if Gaza is to be rebuilt, from scratch in some places, it makes little sense for hundreds of thousands of civilians to be sheltering in the rubble.",
      "The task of rebuilding Gaza will be monumental. Unexploded munitions and mountains of debris have to be removed. Water and power lines have to be repaired. Schools, hospitals and shops need to be rebuilt.",
      "Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has said that could take years - and while that goes on, the Palestinians will need to go somewhere.",
      "However, rather than exploring ways of keeping them close to home, almost certainly in camps in the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, Trump says they should be encouraged to leave - permanently.",

      "Even for a president who spent much of his first term upending US Middle East policy \u2013 including moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights \u2013 this was an astonishing proposal.",

      "To be clear, to do this by force would be a grave violation of international law.",
      "Some Palestinians would likely choose to leave Gaza and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Since October 2023, as many as 150,000 already have.",
      "But others cannot or will not, either because they lack the financial means to do so or because their attachment to Gaza \u2013 part of the land they call Palestine \u2013 is simply too strong.",
      "Many Gazans are descendants of people who fled or were driven from their homes in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel - a period Palestinians call the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe.",
      "The thought of another will be too painful for many and they will cling to their reduced lives in what remains of Gaza with a fierce determination.",
      "For Palestinians who dream of a state of their own, alongside Israel, the loss of part of it will feel like an amputation.",
      "Gaza has been physically separated from the West Bank since 1948. Previous rounds of negotiations, as well as Trump's 2020 \"Vision for Peace\", included plans for tunnels or railways that might link the two.",
      "Now Trump is basically telling the Palestinians to give up on Gaza once and for all.",
      "While he does not appear to be advocating the forced deportation of civilians - which is against international law - Trump is clearly encouraging Palestinians to leave.",
      "Palestinian officials have already accused Israel of blocking the supply of tens of thousands of caravans which could help Gazans to stay put in less damaged parts of the territory while reconstruction takes place elsewhere.",

      "Both have enough problems of their own without this added burden.",
      "What is the current status of Gaza?",
      "Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years before it was seized by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War.",
      "It is still considered occupied by Israel under international law, which Israel disputes. It says the occupation ended in 2005, when it unilaterally dismantled Jewish settlements and pulled out its military.",
      "Around three quarters of UN members recognise Gaza as part of a sovereign state of Palestine, though the US does not.",

      "Could Trump take over Gaza if he wants to?",
      "It goes without saying that the US has no legal claim to the territory and it is not at all clear how Trump intends to impose American rule.",
      "As with his bullish claims about US control over Greenland or the Panama Canal, it is not yet clear whether Trump really means it or if the comments represent an opening, outlandish bargaining position ahead of a bruising set of negotiations on Gaza's future.",
      "Various plans have been discussed for the post-war governance of Gaza.",
      "In December, the two main Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, agreed to form a joint committee to oversee its administration - an agreement which has so far come to nothing.",
      "At other times, discussions have focused on the creation of an international peacekeeping force, possibly made up of troops from Arab countries.",
      "Last month, Reuters reported that the UAE, US and Israel had discussed the formation of a temporary administration in Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA), which already has control in parts of the West Bank, was ready to take over.",
      "However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously publicly insisted that the PA will have no role to play in running post-war Gaza.",
      "In a limited sense, American boots are already on the ground. A US security firm has employed around 100 former US special forces to man a vital checkpoint south of Gaza City and screen the vehicles of Palestinians returning to the north for weapons.",
      "Egyptian security personnel have also been seen at the same checkpoint.",
      "These could be the first, tentative signs of an expanded international - and possibly US-led - presence in Gaza.",
      "But that is hardly a US takeover, something that would require a large-scale military intervention in the Middle East - the sort of thing Trump has long told voters he wants to avoid.",
      "Could there be implications for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire?",
      "Negotiations on phase two of the two-week-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have barely begun but it is hard to see how Trump's bombshell remarks will help to advance them.",
      "If Hamas feels the end product of this whole process is a depopulated Gaza - devoid not just of Hamas, but of all Palestinians - it may conclude there is nothing to talk about and hold on to the remaining hostages it took on 7 October 2023.",
      "Netanyahu's critics have accused him of looking for excuses to blow up the negotiations and resume the war. They are bound to conclude that, with these comments, Trump is a willing accomplice.",
      "On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister's right-wing backers have expressed satisfaction with the US takeover plan, potentially reducing the risk of cabinet resignations and making Netanyahu's immediate political future appear more assured.",
      "In that sense, Trump has given Netanyahu a powerful incentive to keep the ceasefire going.",
      "What did Donald Trump say about the West Bank?",
      "Asked whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would have an announcement to make in four weeks' time.",
      "That remark has caused alarm among Palestinians, for whom such an announcement would inevitably be seen as another nail in the coffin for a two-state solution.",
      "Recognising the legitimacy of Israel's settlements in the West Bank would be a hugely consequential move. Most of the rest of the world regards them as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.",
      "During previous rounds of peace talks, negotiators recognised that Israel would get to hold onto large settlement blocs as part of a final agreement, probably in exchange for small chunks of Israeli territory.",
      "In 2020, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords, which secured the historic normalisation of relations between Israel and two Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.",
      "The UAE signed that agreement on the understanding Israel would not annex parts of the West Bank - an understanding which may now be in jeopardy.",

    "story": [
      "Google has become the latest big US firm to scrap its goals to recruit more workers from underrepresented groups, BBC News understands.",
      "The decision to abandon the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) recruitment targets comes after the company carried out an annual review of its corporate policies.",
      "The technology giant is also reviewing some of its other DEI programmes.",
      "US President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies. Since his return to the White House just over two weeks ago, Trump has ordered government agencies to eliminate such initiatives.",
      "\"We're committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities,\" a Google spokesperson said.",
      "\"We've updated our [annual investor report] language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\"",
      "The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Between 2021 and 2024, Google's investor reports stated its commitment to make \"diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do\". That line is not in its latest report, which was published on Wednesday.",
      "In recent years, Google had been an outspoken supporter of DEI targets, particularly after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the protests that followed his death.",
      "At the time, Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, set a five-year goal to increase the number of its leaders who came from underrepresented groups by 30%.",
      "According to the company, the proportion of black people among its leadership almost doubled between 2020 and last year. It also said representation of women and Latino people had increased in those roles.",
      "Google is the latest major company to make a U-turn on its diversity policies.",
      "Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others have rolled back their DEI programmes.",
      "Apple has stood out by pushing back against this trend. Last month, the tech giant's board asked investors to vote against a proposal to end its diversity policies.",
      "The proposal by conservative group, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), called on the iPhone maker to abolish its DEI policies, saying they expose firms to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\".",
      "Last week, the retail chain Target was sued by a group of shareholders, led by the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida, who said the firm had defrauded them by allegedly concealing the risks associated with its DEI policies.",
      "The lawsuit referred to a 2023 backlash over LGBTQ+ merchandise at its stores, which caused both its sales and its stock price to drop.",
      "Target has also recently announced that it was ending its DEI targets.",
      "In the latest example of the Trump administration's disapproval of such policies, the US President last week speculated, without giving evidence, that DEI had led to an air crash in Washington DC.",
      "The remarks, which came less than 24 hours after the crash, were in line with the White House's efforts to undo such programmes.",

      "Republicans say it restores fairness to sports but LGBT advocacy and human rights organisations have described the move as discriminatory.",
      "The order, which goes into effect immediately, largely covers high school, universities and grassroots sports.",

      "Transgender women banned from top golf toursWorld Athletics bans transgender women",
      "Transgender women banned from top golf tours",
      "World Athletics bans transgender women",
      "According to White House officials who briefed reporters on Wednesday morning, this latest order empowers the Department of Education to investigate how schools implement Title IX, a US law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded education programmes.",
      "An administration official said that the executive order will reverse the position of the Biden administration which in April last year said that LGBT students would be protected by federal law, although it did not give specific guidance on transgender athletes.",
      "\"If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and risk your federal funding,\" Trump explained.",
      "Additionally, the White House plans to bring in sporting bodies - such as the National Collegiate Athletics Association, or NCAA - to come to the White House to meet female athletes and their parents to discuss concerns.",
      "The official who discussed the order, said the US would do all it could to prevent transgender athletes from competing against females in International Olympic Committee competitions that take place on US soil.",
      "President Trump specified that the order would include the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.",
      "He has said he will deny visas for transgender Olympic athletes trying to visit the US to compete at the LA Games.",

      "He said he would direct the secretary of homeland security \"to deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes...\"",

      "In a statement, Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson said that the order \"exposes young people to harassment and discrimination, emboldening people to question the gender of kids who don't fit a narrow view of how they're supposed to dress or look\".",
      "\"For so many students, sports are about finding somewhere to belong,\" Ms Robinson added. \"Not partisan policies that make life harder for them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio has said Rome had no choice but to release a Libyan war crimes suspect due \"errors and inaccuracies\" in an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC).",
      "Osama Almasri Najim, head of Libya's judicial police, was apprehended in Turin on 19 January.",
      "Two days later, he was released and flown back to Tripoli on an Italian air force plane.",
      "Mr Najim faces various charges including murder, rape, and torture linked to his role at Tripoli's Mitiga detention centre, and his release drew condemnation from opposition parties and NGOs.",
      "Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, Carlo Nordio said the warrant that led to Mr Najim's detention was riddled with \"inaccuracies, omissions, discrepancies and contradictory conclusions\" which meant the Libyan citizen could not be held in jail.",
      "Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said Mr Najim was expelled as he was a \"national security risk\".",
      "Images shared by Libyan media showing a jubilant crowd welcoming Mr Najim back circulated widely on Italian media. The ICC has demanded an explanation from the Italian authorities.",
      "Elly Schlein, leader of the opposition Democratic Party (PD), accused Nordio of speaking not as a government minister but as a \"defence lawyer for a torturer\".",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni disclosed that she, Nordio and Piantedosi were under investigation in connection with Mr Najim's release.",
      "A special court that handles cases involving ministers has begun an investigation.",
      "David Yambio, a 27-year-old from South Sudan who says he was abused in Tripoli's Mitiga prison, told the BBC that Italy was \"complicit in the atrocities taking place in Libya\".",
      "He says he first encountered Mr Najim after he was caught at sea while trying to cross the Mediterranean on a boat and was returned to Libya.",
      "After he was forced to join a militia \u2013 which he says was \"a pure nightmare\" \u2013  Mr Yambio ended up in Mitiga, where he says he suffered months of torture. He also said he saw Mr Najim abuse other migrants.",
      "\"The injustice we suffered, and how Italy became complicit in our eyes, is clear. They took justice away from us.\"",
      "\"Our torturer was in Italy, he was arrested, and then he was smuggled back to Libya,\" Mr Yambio added.",
      "As a signatory to the ICC, Italy is legally bound to execute the court's warrants.",
      "But critics suggest Italy's decision to free Mr Najim may have been influenced by its political and business ties with Libya.",
      "In 2017, the centre-left government of Paolo Gentiloni forged a deal with Tripoli that saw Italy pay the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats before they reach Italian shores.",
      "NGOs have consistently criticised this policy, which they say exposes migrants to dire conditions in Libyan detention centres.",
      "The case has now dominated Italian headlines for weeks.",
      "Yet it is unlikely the investigation into Meloni, Nordio and Piantedosi will yield any meaningful consequences, given the government's solid parliamentary majority.",
      "Last week, Meloni suggested that the investigation was part of a politically motivated attack from the left and said she would not be \"blackmailed or intimidated\".",
      "But some commentators believe that Libya's ability to leverage its relationship with Rome highlights Italy's vulnerability on migration \u2013 one of Meloni's flagship issues.",
      "\"While Meloni insists she is not susceptible to blackmail from the judiciary, she is highly vulnerable to Libya, given her fixation on migration,\" said Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome's Institute for International Affairs.",
      "She added that the issue had been \"weaponised and exploited\" by Libya.",
      "\"The implicit message is: either you release Mr Najim or we will let the migrant boats through.\"",
      "Libya plays a key role in the success of Meloni's Mattei Plan - an ambitious set of policies that aims to boost European co-operation with Africa in exchange for curbing irregular migration.",
      "\"The question of Libya is and remains a matter of... national security, meaning the safety of all citizens,\" former interior minister Marco Minniti told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.",
      "\"A large part of national security is played out beyond national borders.\"",
      "For Mr Yambio and other survivors of the atrocities that Mr Najim is accused of, the release of the man they say tortured them is \"a deep betrayal\".",
      "In a letter to Giorgia Meloni, they called for an end to the Italy-Libya migration agreement, as well as the release of those still detained in Libyan camps.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 23:49:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The tariffs and US President Donald Trump's '51st State' comments have made way for a surge of patriotism in Canada.",
    "story": [
      "After US President Donald Trump threatened Canada with steep tariffs, Monika Morelli from Montreal cancelled her subscriptions to Netflix and Amazon, two giant American companies.",
      "She also called off a trip that she had planned for later in the year to New Orleans.",
      "\"There is something that has been irrevocably broken now, after centuries of the US and Canada being allies,\" Ms Morelli, 39, told the BBC.",
      "The threaten of import taxes, she said, plus Trump's remarks that Canada could become the 51st US state, \"have made something snap in us all\".",
      "Trump had vowed to slap a 25% tariff on both Canada and Mexico this week, citing issues with border security.",
      "He then struck a surprise deal with Mexico on Monday that resulted in the duties being delayed for 30 days in exchange for more Mexican troops at the border. A similar deal was agreed with Canada later in the day.",
      "For Canadians, who had been deeply anxious about the economic consequences of the tariffs, the delay elicited a sigh of relief. But some feel the threat has caused a rift in the US-Canada relationship.",
      "Data released on Wednesday by national pollster Angus Reid found that 91% of Canadians want their country to rely less on the US in the future, preferring that option over repairing the US-Canada relationship, though more than half still wanted to try.",
      "The opinion survey also noted a big jump in national pride, and found that 90% of Canadians were following this issue closely, mimicking engagement levels not seen since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Shachi Kurl, president of Angus Reid, told the BBC the numbers capture \"a moment of unity\" in the country. They also showed that Canadians have responded to the US tariffs with a shared sense of anger, she said.",
      "With the US being the largest customer for Canadian goods, the tariffs threaten to push the Canadian economy into a recession and put thousands of jobs at risk.",
      "In addition to the tariffs, Trump has stated repeatedly (possibly as a joke) that Canada should instead become a US state to avoid paying the levy - a remark that has been met with fury from Canadians, and has been seen by some as a threat to their sovereignty.",
      "The issue has made way for a surge of patriotism in Canada - notably uniting people from all political stripes at a time when the country had been deeply divided over the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his policies.",
      "A \"Buy Canadian\" sentiment has been pushed by politicians and the general public, with shoppers wanting to support local businesses and avoid purchasing US-made products in protest over the potential tariffs.",
      "Carole Chandler, a 67-year-old retired public school teacher from Halifax, said that she, like Ms Morelli, had cancelled an upcoming holiday to Florida.",
      "\"I love America and Americans,\" she tells the BBC. \"But I don't want to be one.\"",
      "Even with the temporary pause on tariffs, some Canadian provinces are still pushing ahead with \"Buy Local\" campaigns to encourage people to spend their dollars closer to home.",
      "On Wednesday, Manitoba's premier Wab Kinew said his province will be spending C$140,000 ($97,800; \u00a378,200) on advertising - including on billboards and radio - to push Manitobans to contribute to their local economy.",
      "Provinces are also removing barriers to trade internally within Canada, and many are calling for the country to diversify its trade relationship and build ties elsewhere.",
      "Kinew described the back and forth on the potential tariff war between the US and Canada as akin to \"whiplash\".",
      "\"But through it all, to see people come together and to rally around the flag, to put the Manitoba pride first and foremost, has been very encouraging,\" Kinew said.",
      "Ms Kurl noted that the Canada-US relationship has endured for centuries, and the two countries have long been close allies and partners on the world stage.",
      "\"It's quite an enmeshed relationship,\" she said.",
      "Canadians share not only deep economic ties with the US, but also familial bonds and the world's longest land border. The US has also long been the top travel destination for Canadians.",
      "She said it would not be easy to untangle those ties, and it remains to be seen whether the recent sentiments over Trump's tariffs signal a fundamental shift between the two countries.",
      "A lot of it, she added, could depend on how the relationship with the current US president progresses, and whether the tariff threat materialises.",
      "As Canadians wait and see what happens, they said they were looking to support their own however they can.",
      "\"We don't put on big displays like Americans do,\" said Ms Chandler from Halifax.",

    "story": [
      "The Argentine government led by Javier Milei has announced that it plans to pull out of the World Health Organisation (WHO).",
      "A spokesman for President Milei said the decision to exit the WHO was triggered by \"deep differences regarding health management especially during the [Covid-19] pandemic\".",
      "The announcement comes just over two weeks after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing from the international health body.",
      "The two leaders have expressed admiration for each other, with Milei calling Trump's re-election the \"greatest political comeback in history\", while the US president described his Argentine counterpart as \"my favourite president\".",
      "The decision by President Milei to withdraw his country from the WHO follows the same arguments that underpinned the withdrawal of the United States.",
      "Both cited the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw a long lockdown imposed in Argentina, as well as concerns over Chinese influence over the global health body.",
      "The difference is the impact this is likely to have on the WHO itself.",
      "The USA is by far the biggest individual contributor to the UN body, putting in around $950m (\u00a3760m) in 2024, nearly 15% of the total budget. The US withdrawal will pose some difficult financial questions.",
      "Argentina on the other hand contributes roughly $8m a year. That is unlikely to make any significant material difference.",

      "If more states pull out \u2013 and that is admittedly a big if - the credibility of the WHO as the one truly global health body could take a hit.",
      "Argentine media say they expect President Milei to sign an executive order in the coming days which will begin the process of Argentina pulling out from the WHO.",

      "China has accused the US of making \"unfounded and false allegations\" about its role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products.",
      "The complaint was lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO) one day after US President Donald Trump raised border taxes on Chinese goods by 10%, a measure he said was intended to address an influx of illegal drugs.",
      "In the filing, China said the measures were \"discriminatory and protectionist\" and violated trade rules.",
      "But experts have warned that China is unlikely to secure a ruling in its favour as the panel that settles trade disputes remains unable to function. One former WTO official told the BBC it has \"no possibility of succeeding\".",
      "The dispute comes as Trump's plans for tariffs - a tax he has said he wants to see imposed on all foreign shipments into the country - are causing uncertainty across the global trade landscape.",
      "Trump has said tariffs will encourage firms to make their products in the US, repeatedly expressing concern about the size of America's trade deficit.",
      "But his actions against China - which he has threatened to widen to include Canada, Mexico and Europe - have sparked concerns about their impact on the global economy, including in the US, as businesses respond to trade uncertainty by holding off on investments or pass on new costs to customers.",

      "The rise also contributed to the widest trade deficit, or gap, between exports and imports in nearly two years.",

      "On Wednesday, Bloomberg also reported that the country's anti-monopoly regulator was preparing for a possible investigation into Apple's policies and App Store fees, hitting the company's shares.",
      "Trump's moves - which included ordering an end of duty-free treatment for parcels worth less than $800 - will be a major \"shock\" to some firms, such as Shein and Temu, as they erode the ability to offer ultra-low prices, said Mark Williams, chief China economist at Capital Economics.",

      "The US also ignored a previous finding by the WTO that earlier tariffs on steel and aluminium that were imposed during Trump's first term were against the rules.",
      "But Tom Graham, who chaired the WTO's appellate body in 2016 and 2019, told the BBC it would \"probably be a year\" before there is a decision from the first stage of Beijing's complaint and it has little chance of progressing further.",
      "\"It may be a strong case, the way the WTO dispute settlement system used to work, but it has no possibility of succeeding here ultimately,\" he said.",
      "Jeff Moon, who worked on China trade policy for President Barack Obama, told the BBC that he expected any initial WTO decision to support China's position.",
      "These cases typically take years to be resolved, however, and because the appeals process has been paralysed, \"a final decision will never be issued\".",

      "Mr Najim faces various charges including murder, rape, and torture linked to his role at Tripoli's Mitiga detention centre, and his release drew condemnation from opposition parties and NGOs.",
      "Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, Carlo Nordio said the warrant that led to Mr Najim's detention was riddled with \"inaccuracies, omissions, discrepancies and contradictory conclusions\" which meant the Libyan citizen could not be held in jail.",
      "Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said Mr Najim was expelled as he was a \"national security risk\".",

      "Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and began constructing settlements in both that are widely seen as illegal under international law. In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, although the UN still regards it as Israeli-occupied territory.",

      "One of US President Donald Trump's first actions after returning to office was signing an executive order pausing almost all foreign assistance for 90 days while a review could be carried out. He has said USAID is run by \"radical left lunatics\" and is getting away with \"tremendous fraud\" - without giving evidence.",
      "Mr Sherembey, who heads 100% Life, the largest patient-led organisation in Ukraine, recalls that when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, warehouses storing HIV medication were bombed.",

      "\"USAID's slogan is that this is assistance from the American people. But it turns out that this aid could be stopped by the decision of one person,\" he says.",
      "USAID was established in 1961 by President John F Kennedy. It has around 10,000 employees and a budget of nearly $40bn (\u00a332.25bn), out of a total of $68bn in US government foreign aid spending.",
      "It has bases in more than 60 countries, and works in dozens of others. However, most of the work on the ground is carried out by other organisations that it contracts and funds.",

      "A doctor responsible for USAID-funded projects there says more than 60 of his team, including midwives, nurses and doctors, were told to stay at home after funding was paused.",

      "\"If an opposition figure, a university student, or a women's rights activist is arrested in Iran, it is NGOs like the one I work for that immediately act so the person's email and social media accounts are locked and removed,\" says the activist, who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisals.",

      "But unhappy with Biden's position on issues from labour laws to transgender rights, Musk began to look to the other side of the aisle in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Initially, Musk called for Trump to \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" and had backed his rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for the Republican nomination. But he soon became the president's biggest booster, contributing $288m to Trump and other Republican candidates and becoming a key adviser on the campaign.",

      "His tactics - relentless, sometimes ruthless - are reminiscent of how he ran his previous companies, former employees say.",
      "A former programme manager at Tesla, who spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said Musk \"did not care\" about the human cost of his decisions.",
      "\"He's only concerned with the objective at hand. I think he views interpersonal issues and conflicts as ancillary things that are not worth his time,\" he said.",
      "Occasionally, Musk tended toward the impulsive. The manager recalled seeing Musk fire a fellow Tesla employee on the spot over an overflowing rubbish can.",
      "\"He interpreted that as a sign that this person didn't take as much pride in his work as he should,\" he said. \"That was the nuance to it\u2026 but at the end of the day someone got fired because they admitted that their trash can was overflowing.\"",
      "The approach yielded a committed workforce, the employee said. If you were on board with Musk's mission, that single-minded focus was motivating, he said, and helped fuel regular 13 plus-hour days on the job.",
      "\"He can get more out of people than anyone else I have ever seen,\" he recalled, although he added that the intensity at Tesla was par for the course in Silicon Valley.",
      "But for those in the federal government, the employee added, \"it's gotta be a culture shock.\"",

      "But in recent days, employees have watched with increasing alarm as Musk set his sights directly on USAID, labelling their agency a \"criminal organisation\" on X.",
      "Musk's increasingly harsh rhetoric has coincided with equally drastic changes at USAID.",
      "On 1 February, the USAID website stopped working; its X account appeared to vanish not long after. That same weekend,  two top security officials were placed on administrative leave after a confrontation with Doge representatives over access to a secure facility used for reviewing classified information, the Washington Post and other US outlets reported.",
      "On Monday, USAID employees were told to stay at home while hundreds of employees were locked out of their email. CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reports USAID employees are being pulled out of their respective countries worldwide by Friday.",

      "\"The comments from Elon Musk have been particularly cutting, calling us a 'criminal organisation' that needs to 'die,''\" said a USAID staffer, who asked not to be named because they feared retaliation from Musk and the administration.",

      "The broadcaster found he had no convictions to his name and had declared no income over the past few years.",
      "What do we know about the weapon?",
      "According to Swedish Radio, the ongoing police investigation lists an automatic firearm as the weapon used.",
      "SVT suggested it was a hunting weapon owned legally by the suspect.",
      "During Wednesday's press conference, Mr Forest was unable to confirm any details about the weapon, or say whether one or more was used.",
      "What do we know about the victims?",
      "Police said 11 people had died, including the suspected gunman.",
      "Health authorities said three women and two men were in stable yet critical condition after operations for gunshot wounds. Another woman was receiving care for minor injuries.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, not all victims had been identified.",
      "Police said they were using fingerprints, dental records and DNA to identify them - alongside interviews with family members.",
      "The school it happened at provides adult education for people aged over 20 who did not finish primary or secondary school, as well as Swedish classes for immigrants.",
      "Maria Pegado told Reuters she took all of her 15 students out into the hallway and they started running. \"I saw people dragging injured out, first one, then another. I realised it was very serious,\" she said.",
      "Two young residents who spoke to the BBC said they feared a racial element to the shooting, given many of the students were known to be immigrants.",

      "Police first received reports of a shooting taking place in Orebro, a city 200km (124 miles) west of Stockholm, at 12:33 local time (11:33 GMT) on Tuesday.",
      "The shooting was at Campus Risbergska - a type of school for adults known as Komvux in Swedish, which is primarily for people who did not finish primary or secondary education. There are other schools also on the campus.",

      "But like the city, it's had its ups and downs. In the 1980s it was taken over by criminal gangs, and its hollow core filled with rubbish up to 50m deep.",
      "\"The building got hijacked. There were no utilities, so most of the people were actually throwing their trash right inside the building, until it reached the 14th floor,\" said Delight Sithole, who runs tours of the building.",
      "He added: \"There were some dead bodies here, illegal firearms, drugs. The smell, I'm sure it was just horrible, just really like, hell on earth.",
      "\"If you asked anybody what happens in that round building, somebody would have something interesting or scary to say about it,\" said Sifiso Zikhali, who works with Mr Sithole in an organisation called Dlala Nje, which means \"just play\" in Zulu.",
      "\"People were scared of the neighbourhood,\" he said.",
      "Johannesburg was seen as being one of the most dangerous cities in the world.",
      "But the building turned itself around 15 years ago in the wake of the Fifa World Cup hosted in South Africa, and people started moving back in.",
      "After Covid, people returned and the building is now around three-quarters full.",
      "There is no escaping the issues that Johannesburg, and South Africa, face.",
      "Despite signs of improvement in the most recent statistics, crime is still a major issue.",
      "Crippling power cuts that plagued the city for years, known as load-shedding, came to an end almost a year ago, but now a water crisis is looming, leaving many without.",
      "A building fire in the Central Business District (CBD) killed almost 80 people in the winter of 2023, and exposed the issue of hijacked buildings, disused housing and apartments blocks that have been taken over by criminal gangs who charge people to live there.",

      "A few days later, on a tour of one of Ithemba's flagship residential developments called Jewel City, senior manager Alan Tait explains the turnaround.",
      "\"The demand is just phenomenal, and that demand is specifically to live in the CBD,\" he said.",

      "Named after its origins as a diamond dealing district, like the Ponte building the area fell into disrepair, only to see a resurgence.",
      "\"We launched Jewel City about five years ago, just as Covid was hitting. So the timing was a little bit out. But as soon as Covid lifted, the buildings filled up quite quickly,\" he said.",

      "It was part of an initiative by a group called JoziMyJozi which started in 2023. One of its first projects was to light up the Nelson Mandela bridge, a centrepiece of the city, that meant people once again found it safe to use.",

      "Could Johannesburg one day be spoken about like London, Paris or New York?",
      "\"Well, that is the intention,\" said Ms Swanepoel. \"Much of what's happening in Joburg is due to perceptions. We have a long way to go. I mean, there's no doubt about that, but it's not impossible. We need to get up there and be the gold standard for cities in Africa.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 05:41:10 GMT",
    "summary": "The document charred by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is being 'unwrapped' using X-ray scans and AI.",
    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "Last year, a Vesuvius Challenge team managed to read about 5% of another Herculaneum scroll.",
      "Its subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.",
      "The Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.",
      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",

    "title": "'It's like hell': Race to evacuate residents from Ukraine front-line city",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:15:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Ukrainian volunteers are going house to house in Pokrovsk as Russian drones hunt from the skies.",
    "story": [
      "As he prepares to set off on another rescue mission on Ukraine's eastern front, 35-year-old Anton Yaremchuk is grateful for the fog. It will shield him and his colleague Pylyp from Russian drones hunting from the skies. His armoured van will provide more protection \u2013 but only up to a point. Every journey could be the last.",
      "In December shrapnel from a drone attack ripped through a clearly marked armoured vehicle used by his team, causing injuries but no deaths.",
      "\"We were extremely lucky,\" he says.",
      "Anton's regular destination these days is the industrial city of Pokrovsk, which he says is \"being attacked night and day\".",
      "Russian forces are closing in \u2013 they are now less than 2km (1.2 miles) away.",
      "\"The last few days we were coming in, there was hell,\" Anton tells us. \"There are around 7,000 people still there. We'll try to get some people out of that nightmare.\"",
      "He's been doing just that since Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "With his country under attack, the Ukrainian cinematographer left his life and career in Berlin, came home and co-founded a small aid organisation, Base UA. Since then, he and his team have managed to get about 3,000 civilians out of harm's way, taking them away from front lines to safer areas.",
      "Pokrovsk used to be one of those places.",
      "\"It's crazy,\" he says as we head for the city, \"because this used to be the haven, the safest city in the region and the biggest hospital. The evacuation train was departing from Pokrovsk.\"",
      "If and when Russian forces take the city, it will deprive the Ukrainian military of a key supply and transport hub.",
      "Ukraine has already lost the output from a crucial coal mine in the area \u2013 the only one producing coking coal for its steel industry. Operations were suspended last month because of the Russian advance.",
      "We join Anton for the journey to Pokrovsk. He has a tourniquet, and a separate medical kit attached to the front of his body armour. His white high-visibility jacket bears the slogan \"leave no-one behind\".",
      "Before we set off, there's a warning. \"When we park, get out of the vehicles and don't stand nearby,\" Anton tells us, \"in case they are targeted.\"",
      "The closer we get the more explosions we hear. War has left its mark, draining the city of life. Streets are deserted, and houses boarded up. Some buildings have been flattened. There's no smoke from the chimneys on snow-capped rooves. We pass a parked car with a white flag.",
      "But we find Olga, already waiting by the roadside, wrapped up in a lilac winter coat and furry hood. She's one of six people on Anton's list for evacuation this time.",
      "She goes to lock up her home - moving quickly despite her 71 years. And then she gets into the van and does not look back.",
      "\"I have been in this house for 65 years,\" Olga says.",
      "\"It's hard to leave everything behind. But it's not life any more, it's like hell. In the beginning we thought maybe we will sit it out, but now the ground is shaking.\"",
      "Her children and grandchildren have already fled the bombing. I ask if she thinks she will be able to come back one day. \"Who knows,\" she replies, \"but we hope.\"",
      "Along the way, whenever Anton spots people out on the street \u2013 and there aren't many - he urges them to go. He stops the car to hand out leaflets explaining that evacuation is free, and help, including a place to stay and ongoing payments, is available in the city of Pavlohrad to the west. But some are hard to persuade.",
      "\"I have to stay,\" one elderly woman says. \"My son has died, and I need to be near his grave.\"",
      "\"I don't think he would want this,\" Anton says.",
      "We drive on and pass a group of three who have been out collecting water. Anton shouts another warning. \"There will be street battles,\" he says, \"unfortunately, I promise you this. I am doing this from the very first day. It's the same everywhere. This is the final stage.\"",
      "One of the women comes forward to take a leaflet. \"God keep you safe,\" she tells him before going on her way.",
      "Anton moves fast from address to address. When there's no answer at one house, he climbs over a high metal gate to investigate. He knocks. He shouts. He speaks to a neighbour. With no sign of the woman he hoped to evacuate, we drive on.",
      "I ask what he's expecting for 2025, now President Trump is back in the White House and pushing for peace talks.",
      "\"I stopped looking too much ahead,\" he says. \"I think nobody really knows what's going to happen. I personally don't think that even if some kind of negotiations will start, they will bring a ceasefire anytime soon.\"",
      "More than this he expects fighting will worsen if talks do start, as both sides will try to gain leverage.",
      "The last pick up of the day is 75-year-old Lyuba \u2013 her white hair peeping out from under a scarf. Her long life is now compressed into a few plastic bags. She looks bereft and flinches at every explosion we hear.",
      "\"It has been bad,\" she tells me. \"Bad. We were left alone. There are no authorities. People are just getting killed under the sky,\" she says, gesturing upwards. \"There's no gas, no water, no electricity.\"",
      "Lyuba is helped into the van, which is now full, with five elderly evacuees \u2013 their memories and their fears - and one black cat peering out from a pet carrier. No-one speaks.",
      "For Anton this is a familiar picture, but still a painful one.",
      "We first travelled with him in the heat of summer in 2022. He was then evacuating civilians from another front-line city \u2013 Lysychansk - as Russian shells rained down.",
      "Now in Ukraine's third winter of war he \u2013 and other volunteers \u2013 are still trying to outrun moving front lines and save whoever they can.",
      "\"To be honest every time I see this I break down,\" he says, \"because it's just these innocent people leaving everything behind. These are human tragedies, and you can never really get used to it. But I am glad that we manage to get people out to safety.\"",
      "That comes at a cost, and it is increasing.",
      "Since we travelled to Pokrovsk, one of Anton's teams has come under fire from a Russian drone. A 28-year-old British volunteer lost an arm and a leg \u2013 saving civilians - but is now stable in hospital.",
      "Following the attack, Anton's group have suspended evacuations from Pokrovsk, and from other front-line areas.",
      "A Ukrainian police unit called the White Angels is still doing rescue missions in the city. They tell us they are \"trying to be very cautious and careful\".",
      "Inside the city, in freezing basements and unlit homes, the remaining residents \u2013 mostly elderly \u2013 are at the mercy of Russian glide bombs and artillery, as they wait for Pokrovsk to fall.",

      "Beyond the investment on securing Super Bowl air time, advertisers spend additional millions on creating their commercials, adding to the pressure for their investments to pay off.

      "\"I'm living a dream way beyond my own dream,\" Yusef said.",
      "CBS News Chicago caught up with Yusef before the awards ceremony Sunday night. Inside Agriculture Custom Clothier at 67 W.

      "Yusef got his big break after performing during a poetry open mic night at Chicago's iconic Green Mill Lounge, 4802 N. Broadway, over 30 years ago. He caught the attention of other artists and the media there.",

      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",
      "She played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.",
      "She fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:48:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

      "Like many homes, Suzanne de Passe's is filled with stuff. Her version of stuff? Gold and platinum albums. Snapshots with Stevie Wonder and a young Michael Jackson. The Oscar-nominated screenplay she co-wrote for \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" Her 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Award.",
      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",

    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",
      "It's been more than a decade since \"The Clock\" was last in New York. Marclay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened, insisting that any museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so audiences can see the nighttime section.",
      "Are there \"Clock\" completists? \"Oh, there are definitely 'Clock' squatters, I would say \u2013     people who really commit to watching it!\" Comer laughed.",
      "But Marclay insists the point isn't to see all of it; it's more to make you hyper-aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock. \"Here, you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time, that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing,\" Marclay said. \"You're more than a viewer. You're a participant in a way, because your life infringes on this clock.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:38:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",
      "In addition to the human health threat posed by the virus, an unprecedented toll claimed by spillovers of the D1.1 from wild birds into chickens has driven up egg prices across the country.",
      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked if D1.1's spillover changes that risk assessment.",
      "\"It is critical that animal health biosecurity practices are enhanced to help prevent the spread of disease and protect animal and worker safety,\" state veterinarian Peter Rolfe said.",

For every case of salmonella detected through a lab test, for example, 29 illnesses are caused by the bacteria, the CDC estimates.",
      "Last year, separate salmonella outbreaks linked to cucumbers and eggs sickened more than 200 people in dozens of states, while listeria outbreaks linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sickened 19, hospitalized 17 and killed two. An outbreak of E. coli in the fall of 2024 linked to organic carrots sickened 48 people in 19 states, killing one.

    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",

      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

      "Foodborne illness kills hundreds of Americans a year, sickens tens of millions annually, and costs billions in medical care, lost productivity and premature deaths, federal researchers said in a report.",
      "Roughly 10 million cases of foodborne illness each year in the U.S. are caused by six pathogens \u2014 salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing E. coli and norovirus, according to a coming study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illnesses result in about 53,300 hospitalizations and more than 900 deaths annually, according to CDC estimates cited this week by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).",
      "The economic impact of these diseases is severe, costing an estimated $75 billion (in 2023 dollars) annually, including costs associated with secondary chronic illnesses and conditions that develop after the initial illness, according to the findings published Monday by the GAO, which also cited research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.",
      "The actual count of people who get sick from eating food is unknown and likely far higher than official tallies, as only a small percentage of illnesses related to contaminated food is diagnosed and reported to public health officials. For every case of salmonella detected through a lab test, for example, 29 illnesses are caused by the bacteria, the CDC estimates.",
      "Last year, separate salmonella outbreaks linked to cucumbers and eggs sickened more than 200 people in dozens of states, while listeria outbreaks linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sickened 19, hospitalized 17 and killed two. An outbreak of E. coli in the fall of 2024 linked to organic carrots sickened 48 people in 19 states, killing one. Another linked to onions served in McDonald's burgers sickened more than 100 people in 14 states, resulting in one death.",

    "summary": "Even next-door neighbors face starkly contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, as nation's home insurance crisis grows.",
    "story": [
      "Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\"I chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\" said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they'll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation's growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\"It changes the whole trajectory to your life,\" said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin's home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state's bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can't get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\"That's why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.'\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \"difficult but purposeful business decisions\" in California.",
      "Mercury didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson's case, and noted that it's difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \"wrap-around insurance\" for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn't cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn't cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\"Being able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\" Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\"Half the time, I feel like I'm doing something wrong,\" Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\"I could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It's just luck, really. It's nothing I did or didn't do,\" Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \"I had the same risk factors as everyone else.\"",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\"They're all trying to manage their exposure,\" Collier said. \"If you think about wildfires, you don't want concentrated exposure.\"",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn't get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \"actual cash value\" coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that's very, very painful,\" said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \"done everything the insurers asked California to do\" but yielded little success.",
      "\"We're marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we're not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\" Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California's fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California's largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\"There's a huge amount of risk in the system and there's a big question of who is going to pay for this,\" Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he'll have to take out loans to rebuild. He's considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility's equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can't fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he's thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\"I don't want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\" Wilson said. \"Stuck paying for an insurance that doesn't cover anything. You don't want to live in a risky area. You don't have the safety net.\"",

      "President Trump's move to tack an additional 10% tariff on U.S. imports from China could lead Mattel to hike the price of its Barbie, Hot Wheels and other toys.",
      "Mattel Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that roughly 40% of the company's toys are made in China, while noting that is less than the industry average of 80%. Overall, the fresh U.S. levies on Chinese good affect about 20% of Mattel's global production.",
      "\"Against the tariff, we have a range of mitigating actions,\" including \"potential price increases,\" he said.",
      "\"We do work closely with our retail partners to achieve the right balance and always keep consumers in mind when we consider pricing actions,\" DiSilvestro added.",
      "Mr. Trump has also imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, where Mattel sources almost 10% of its products, and on Canada. On Monday, the president paused those tariffs for at least 30 days after Mexico and Canada agreed to heighten security at their respective borders with the U.S.",

      "\"We're going to suffer as a small business, but so is everyone in this country,\" Dan Marshall, co-owner of family-run Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CBS News Minnesota this week. Marshall said there are few toy manufacturers left in the U.S., and the tariffs could have an adverse impact.",

It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",

      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "In a response to Wyden's letter, however, Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official at Treasury, told Wyden that DOGE personnel are only only able to read \"coded data\" in the federal payment system and cannot change scheduled systems. DOGE \"has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed,\" Blum wrote.",
      "Bloomberg was the first to report on the letter.",
      "Warren said Blum's letter raised more questions than answers. \"It asserts that a set of Treasury staff members have 'read-only' access but fails to answer questions about non-Treasury employees, like those working for Elon Musk and DOGE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",
      "Tarrio, who had been serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy tied to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol building, was pardoned by President Trump after his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, providing them with the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow-and-black laurel wreath symbol.",
      "\"This is our time to stand up, to be very clear to the Proud Boys and their ilk that we came here fighting, that we have never ever capitulated to the violent whims of white supremacist groups,\" Rev. William H. Lamar IV, pastor of the Metropolitan AME Church, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they thought we would be afraid, they were wrong. There are many people with us and who stand with us.\"",
      "The Metropolitan AME Church, which was founded in 1838 and has hosted speakers including Frederick Douglass and Eleanor Roosevelt, can now collect funds from sales of Proud Boys merchandise as well as its membership dues, people familiar with the case said. The church can also block the Proud Boys from using the trademark, they said.",
      "The notoriety of the Proud Boys' name likely helped the group in recruitment, which means blocking use of its trademark could both hurt the group's ability to sell merchandise and recruit new members, they added.",
      "\"From our point of view, it's fitting that the money the Proud Boys raised in sales and dues will go to fund the good work of the Metropolitan AME,\" Kaitlin Banner, who represented the church in the case and serves as deputy legal director at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, told CBS.",
      "In his statement posted on X, Tarrio indicated he didn't intend to honor the court's ruling. \"I hold in contempt any motions, judgments and orders issued against me,\" he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "China said Tuesday it would counter President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports. It also announced an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures aimed at the U.S., ratcheting up trade tensions between the two economic heavyweights.",
      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday but Mr. Trump paused his plans to\u00a0implement them\u00a0for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",
      "Google didn't immediately comment.",
      "Mr. Trump paused his plans Monday to\u00a0implement steep tariffs\u00a0on imports from Mexico and Canada for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So ... they could put some significant harm on our economy,\" said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.",
      "The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute.",
      "\"I don't think they want the trade war escalating,\" he said. \"And they see (the) example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.\"",
      "But, he adds, \"A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,\" Dover said.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 16:54:21 -0500",
    "summary": "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that Tesla CEO Musk is categorized as a special government employee.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk is categorized as a \"special government employee\" through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a cost-cutting initiative created by President Trump to find ways to trim federal spending.",
      "Musk's employee status was confirmed by White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Monday, although she added that she wasn't sure whether the Tesla CEO has gained security clearance.",
      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",
      "That lawsuit pointed out that, at the time of its filing, Musk's status with the federal government was unclear.",
      "\"The Trump administration has not publicly revealed whether Mr. Musk has been made an officer or employee of the U.S. government or remains a private citizen,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Trump administration also has not publicly revealed the employment status of other individuals who are part of DOGE.\"",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would\u00a0pause the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "The salvo, which Mr. Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies. It also signals the president's first major turn away from his promise on the campaign trail to rapidly reduce everyday costs for Americans once in office.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump acknowledged \"some pain\" could come with the new wave of tariffs but insisted his vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "\"THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\" he wrote. \"BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE \u2014 AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"",
      "The tariffs\u00a0were slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. While the order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas would only be hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States\" with \"import duties\" or \"similar measures,\" the president \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted to social media after the announcement, Mr. Trump said the order was issued through the\u00a0International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u00a0\"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "Trudeau announced in a news conference Saturday night that Canada would retaliate by placing 25% tariffs \"against $155 billion worth of American goods,\" with the first set of tariffs taking effect Tuesday.",
      "\"This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days' time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,\" Trudeau said.",
      "And in a statement posted to social media, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she instructed her economic secretary to put together a response that included both retaliatory tariffs and other measures \"in defense of Mexico's interests.\"",
      "\"We categorically reject the defamatory claims made by the White House accusing the Government of Mexico of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempts to interfere in our territory,\" Sheinbaum wrote.",
      "John Murphy, senior vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which bills itself as the world's largest business organization, slammed Mr. Trump's decision, writing in a statement that \"the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won't solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.\"",

      "Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer and board chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, an agriculture group that advocates for more open trade, said in a statement that Canada, Mexico and China are \"indispensable markets for the livelihood of the American ag economy,\" and \"placing tariffs on the three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, particularly for an extended period of time, would have severe consequences.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the order, writing on social media that Mr. Trump is \"holding Mexico, Canada, and China accountable for their role in the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs across our borders.

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",

      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

    "story": [
      "The CIA confirmed Wednesday that it offered buyouts to employees who volunteer to resign, the latest group of federal workers to receive such a proposal as President Trump pushes to transform the federal government.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to say how many people received the offers or whether they face any deadline to decide.",
      "However, the buyout offered to CIA employees differs from the \"fork in the road\" offer extended to other federal employees and includes Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, known as VERA, and resignation options. And it will not be available to all CIA staff, CBS News has learned.",
      "VERA enables agencies that are being substantially restructured or reorganized to \"temporarily lower the age and service requirements in order to increase the number of employees who are eligible for retirement,\" according to OPM. It's intended to encourage more people to voluntarily separate from their positions earlier and allow employees \"to receive an immediate annuity years before they would otherwise be eligible.\"",
      "There are multiple national security exceptions for the CIA buyouts \u2014 though it's not immediately clear exactly who might be included in these. While the CIA received an agency-wide message similar to the email sent to Office of Personnel Management personnel, eligibility for CIA personnel is limited and based on the mission requirements of certain employees, CBS News has learned. Those who work on high-priority issues may not be approved for the buyout.",
      "For example, some personnel with specialized skill sets designed for intelligence collection, including fluency in some foreign languages, will not be eligible to receive the buyout.",
      "In a statement a CIA spokesperson said of the buyouts that CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the Administration's national security priorities,\" adding that \"these moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission.\" The Wall Street Journal first reported the CIA resignation offers.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management has already offered millions of\u00a0federal workers about eight months of salary if they agree by Thursday to leave their jobs. The CIA and other national security agencies were initially exempted, but the CIA offers suggest few corners of the government will escape Mr. Trump's overhaul.",
      "Mr. Trump has long criticized America's intelligence agencies, and his new CIA director, John Ratcliffe, has promised big changes, claiming the CIA has strayed from its original focus on human-collected intelligence.",
      "Since he took office last month, Mr. Trump has launched an attempt to gut and reshape several federal agencies, most notably the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been largely dismantled by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, the leader of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "National security experts have warned that deep cuts to the CIA and other agencies could put lives at risk by hampering their mission or reducing the flow of intelligence between the U.S. and its allies. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged CIA employees to carefully weigh the offer.",
      "\"There are few government agencies more essential to our national security than the CIA,\" Warner said in a statement. \"A lot of federal employees, including at the CIA, are my constituents, and I've been warning them that these 'buyouts' are empty promises, since Congress hasn't approved any money to do it. I'd hate to see people resign and then get stiffed like the contractors on President Trump's construction projects.\"",
      "Though the precise number is classified, the CIA employs thousands of people engaged in the collection and analysis of foreign intelligence, both at its headquarters in Virginia, as well as overseas postings.",
      "Ratcliffe told the Senate Intelligence Committee in January that the CIA must do a better job of harnessing technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing while also expanding the agency's use of human intelligence collection.",

EPA staffers already received the Office of Personnel Management's \"Fork in the Road\" email, which offered deferred resignations to anyone who agreed to leave their position by Feb. 6. But this individual received an email warning that they could be immediately terminated because of their probationary status as an employee with less than a year in their current role \u2014 which was created under an Inflation Reduction Act temporary program with a two-year probationary period.

The news was especially distressing for Tejada, who worked with many of the staff during his time leading the office, \"I hired all of them,\" he said.",
      "Tejada, now the senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, \"Shuttering the environmental justice office will mean more toxic contaminants, dangerous air and unsafe water in communities across the nation that have been most harmed by pollution in the past.\"",

      "Uganda's healthcare system had already been stretched thin in recent months, battling a separate outbreak of a different disease \u2013 mpox \u2013 that has resulted in at least 2,031 cases, according to the WHO.",
      "Spokespeople for the State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump has also ordered the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO, which was paired with a demand for all U.S. government staff to immediately sever collaboration with the U.N. agency that is helping to coordinate the response within the country.",
      "A U.S. health official said that CDC usually works closely with the WHO and a country's health authorities, often meeting daily to coordinate the response to outbreaks like this.",
      "Despite the president's order regarding WHO, \"CDC has been cleared to speak one-on-one with WHO counterparts related to response activities in Uganda,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement. The CDC said such conversations are also allowed regarding responses to other outbreaks of concern in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Attempts by U.S. agencies to deploy staff to aid the outbreak response have also been delayed, one official said, amid government-wide pauses to travel and spending.",
      "More than 100 staff are currently working in the CDC's office in Uganda, a U.S. official said. Agency staff are also currently embedded within Uganda's response team. An additional team of CDC experts is expected to deploy to the country this weekend, another health official said.",
      "While officials secured a waiver on Saturday from the State Department to free up some funds for the Ebola response, many recipients of U.S. funds have been reluctant to accept the money because of the turmoil in Washington, two people familiar with the situation said.",

      "In Uganda, groups are still waiting for clarification from their in-country contacts at USAID about how the waiver would apply to their work, the people said, wary of incurring more expenses that might never be repaid.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's executive orders, the country's health ministry urged all staff backed by CDC and USAID to \"continue working in the spirit of patriotism as volunteers,\" in a letter obtained by CBS News, as Ugandan officials sought \"to restore normalcy.\"",

      "The growing outbreak in Uganda has also left some state and local health authorities befuddled with the \"radio silence\" from the CDC, officials told CBS News.",
      "In past outbreaks, CDC officials were quick to start ramping up preparedness for the possibility of cases spreading to the U.S.",
      "External meetings and information sharing that health authorities usually rely on to communicate with CDC officials were canceled amid the communications \"pause\" across the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The communications pause was initially expected to end this past weekend, but many federal health officials say they're still facing delays or denials in getting approval to publish information or participate in external meetings.",
      "\"HHS continues to increase staff levels as we look forward to the new Secretary leading the agency. HHS has approved numerous communications related to critical health and safety needs and will continue to do so,\" Andrew Nixon, the department's communications director, told CBS News in an earlier statement.",

The PA has limited authority over the other, larger Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is run separately from Gaza.",
      "\"These calls represent a serious violation of international law, and peace and stability in the region will not be achieved without the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,\" Abbas said.",
      "Negotiations have begun over the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which has seen 18 hostages released by Hamas and other militants in Gaza since it came into effect on January 19, including one man who is an American citizen.",
      "In the current, six-week first phase of the deal, Hamas is to free more hostages every week in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners being released from Israeli jails.",
      "If the deal holds, the hostage and prisoner exchanges will continue, with a total of 33 Israeli captives set to be released during the first phase.

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 19:02:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, recording as many 1,000 arrests on some days.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is releasing some migrant detainees, in some cases dozens per day, as space in its detention system has exceeded maximum capacity amid a spike in arrests by the agency under President Trump, internal government statistics obtained by CBS News show.",
      "On Tuesday morning, space inside ICE detention facilities was at 109% capacity, with the agency holding close to 42,000 migrant detainees, despite having, on paper, a 38,521-bed capacity in its network of for-profit prisons and county jails, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security data. More than half of those in ICE custody were initially arrested along the southern border, the figures show.",
      "On Monday, ICE released roughly 160 migrants from its custody, the figures show, an indication that the Trump administration, faced with the same operational and legal challenges on immigration enforcement that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican presidents, is being forced to release some detainees. Those released can be fitted by ICE with ankle monitors, to track their movements.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, ICE acknowledged that its \"enhanced\" operations have yielded \"a significant number of arrests of criminal aliens that require greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"We are exploring every solution including working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and our state and local law enforcement partners, asking Congress for increased funding, and scrutinizing case files to quickly remove criminal aliens with executable final orders of removal from Department of Justice immigration judges,\" the agency said.",
      "ICE also said some immigration laws require it to release certain migrants, noting that those released remain under the agency's supervision.",
      "Earlier this week, NBC News reported ICE had released some migrants recently arrested under the Trump administration.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, recording as many 1,000 arrests on some days, compared to the 312 daily average during former President Joe Biden's last year in office. The Trump administration has rescinded several Biden-era limits on ICE arrests, giving the agency a broad mandate to go after most of those in the U.S. illegally, including unauthorized migrants without criminal records.",
      "But those arrested by ICE often have to be detained for days and weeks \u2014 and in some cases, months \u2014 before the agency completes all the paperwork and legal process necessary to deport them. Sometimes, those migrants can't be deported because their home countries do not accept them, and the Supreme Court has limited detention in those cases. In other cases, judges grant them relief from deportation.",
      "Because of the limited space at existing holding facilities, ICE is planning to dramatically expand its detention capacity as it seeks to fulfill what Mr. Trump has promised will be the largest mass deportation campaign in U.S. history.",
      "On one hand, the agency is seeking to expand its own network of detention centers. An internal government memo last month indicated that ICE was eyeing 14 new detention sites that could hold as many as 1,000 detainees each, as well as four larger facilities with 10,000 beds each.",
      "But ICE is also turning to other agencies to augment its detention capabilities. The Department of Defense has already authorized ICE to detain migrants at a Space Force base in Colorado, and the Guantanamo Bay Naval base received its first group of migrant detainees on Tuesday after Mr. Trump directed officials to convert facilities there into a massive immigration detention center.",
      "Over the weekend, Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, asked county sheriffs to help federal immigration officers arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants, Reuters reported.",
      "The Trump administration has also considered holding ICE detainees inside large tent sites, known as \"soft-sided\" facilities, that were set up by Border Patrol along the southern border to temporarily house and process migrant families and children, two officials familiar with the proposal told CBS News.",
      "It's unclear whether that plan will be implemented. It could face significant operational and safety challenges as soft-sided facilities were designed for short-term processing and are not as secure as ICE detention centers.",
      "But, unlike ICE, Border Patrol's detention space is well under capacity. On Tuesday morning, Customs and Border Protection had fewer than 2,000 migrants in its custody, using roughly 9% of its 21,000-person detention capacity, according to the internal DHS data.",
      "That is mainly due to the relative calm at the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings are nearing a five-year low. In January, Border Patrol processed nearly 30,000 migrants who crossed the southern border illegally, the lowest level since May 2020, internal government figures show.",

The group will also review the two federal cases against Mr. Trump pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith and will examine the prosecutions of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "As the Justice Department has begun collecting information about the FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations and fired career prosecutors who worked on the cases, Bondi said in her directive that the working group would investigate \"improper investigative tactics and unethical prosecutions\" versus \"good faith actions by federal employees simply following orders.\"",
      "Bondi is also accusing the Biden administration of targeting Catholic Americans and parents at school board meetings, and abusing the FACE Act \u2014\u00a0passed in 1994 \u2014 which makes it illegal to harm, threaten or interfere with an individual \"obtaining or providing reproductive health services\" or damage a facility \"because such facility provides reproductive health.\" These efforts will also be reviewed by the working group.",
      "The new group will \"review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority in the United States\u2026 to identify instances where a department's or agency's conduct appears to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice or legitimate governmental objectives,\" Bondi wrote. She added that her department would provide quarterly reports to the White House on the group's findings.",
      "Bondi also targeted sanctuary jurisdictions with an order to end funding to any that \"unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.\" She encouraged the department to pursue enforcement actions against sanctuary cities or states that do not comply with the federal government's immigration efforts.",
      "\"State and local jurisdictions must comply with applicable immigration-related federal laws,\" one memo says, adding that \"state and local actors may not impede, obstruct, or otherwise fail to comply with lawful immigration-related directives.\"",
      "In a separate memo targeting cartels and transnational criminal organizations, Bondi ordered \"additional resources and thoughtful charging decisions\" to fight illegal drug trafficking and pursue \"total elimination\" of these groups.",
      "Bondi also ended a moratorium on federal executions put in place by former President Joe Biden, who had ended federal executions during his presidency. In 2020, the first Trump administration carried out 10 executions after that had been paused for 17 years.",
      "\"Going forward, the Department of Justice will once again act as the law demands,\" a memo reads, \"including by seeking death sentences in appropriate cases and swiftly implementing those sentences in accordance with the law.\" The memo emphasizes that prosecutors should seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of a law-enforcement officer or a capital crime by an illegal immigrant.",
      "Another memo establishes a task force to \"prioritize seeking justice\" for the victims of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel perpetrated by Hamas, emphasizing that the department is investigating Hamas leadership, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), and \"U.S.-based individuals and entities that provide funding to Hamas.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, marking his latest move\u00a0targeting transgender rights.",
      "\"The war on women's sports is over,\" Mr. Trump declared at a White House event celebrating the mandate.",
      "The order, titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" mandates that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Those not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're putting every school receiving taxpayer dollars on notice,\" he said.",
      "A White House official who briefed reporters on the order before Mr. Trump signed it said transgender female athletes can compete on co-ed or male teams. Republicans have argued that transgender girls and women athletes have biological advantages that are unfair and unsafe for other girls and women.",
      "\"This is about preserving women's sports for women, and that if you are not a woman, you should absolutely have opportunities in sports, but the burden should not always be on women to accommodate that,\" the official said.",

      "Mr. Trump was surrounded by young female athletes as he signed the order.",
      "The executive order follows a Republican measure that passed the House last month. The bill passed 218 to 206, with two Democrats joining the Republican majority.",
      "The House bill, known as the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,\" would amend Title IX to recognize a person's \"sex\" as \"based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" Schools that allow \"a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls\" risk losing federal funding.",
      "The bill has yet to see any movement in the Senate, where Republicans hold the majority and senators have been consumed with confirming Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees. It's also unclear whether the measure can amass seven Democratic votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster.",
      "The president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Charlie Baker, called for clarity on the issue as he testified to Congress in December. But Baker said he was aware of \"less than 10\" transgender athletes among the more than half a million student athletes governed by the NCAA.",
      "\"We believe that's consistent with federal policy,\" Baker said in a contentious exchange with Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri about why transgender athletes were permitted to participate in women's sports. \"The clarity on this issue at the federal level would be very helpful.\"",
      "The NCAA said in a statement Wednesday that Mr. Trump's executive order \"provides a clear, national standard\" and its board of governors is reviewing the mandate and \"will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days.\"",
      "\"The Association will continue to help foster welcoming environments on campuses for all student-athletes. We stand ready to assist schools as they look for ways to support any student-athletes affected by changes in the policy,\" the NCAA said.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland on Wednesday temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship\u00a0from taking effect nationwide, becoming the second to rule against the president amid a rush of legal challenges\u00a0to his directive.",
      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman, appointed by former President Joe Biden, agreed to grant a preliminary injunction sought by immigrants-rights groups after conducting a hearing on the request. The organizations, led by Maryland-based CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, filed a lawsuit arguing Mr. Trump's executive order targeting birthright citizenship violates the Constitution and federal law.",
      "\"This is a victory for our families, for our country, and for the Constitution of the United States. This is the level of fight that will be required for the next four years of the Trump administration,\" George Escobar, chief of Programs and Services of CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, said. \"The pregnant women who took this case up against President Trump \u2014 and so many immigrants across the country \u2014 can breathe easier knowing that their precious children are citizens and afforded the full rights that come with that.\"",
      "The suit brought in Maryland is one of at least eight that were filed in courts from coast to coast soon after Mr. Trump signed the order on his first day in office. Entitled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" the directive denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful residents.",
      "The immigrants-rights' groups are suing alongside five women who are pregnant and live in the U.S. They now fear their children will be denied U.S. citizenship because of their immigration status and that of their fathers, according to the filing.",
      "\"Every day, babies are being born in the United States whose constitutionally guaranteed citizenship will be called into doubt under the Executive Order,\" they wrote in their suit.",
      "Swapna Reddy, co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, said the court's decision was the right one and warned that Mr. Trump's executive order \"has created chaos for so many families, including ASAP members, who are scared their children will not be able to live a life free of fear in the only country they will have ever known.\"",

      "Bondi's nomination for attorney general was approved Tuesday by the upper chamber 54 to 46, with one Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joining all Republicans in voting to confirm her. She will take over as the nation's top law enforcement officer as Mr. Trump has pledged to end what he calls the weaponization of the Justice Department and threatened to target his critics.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office to Bondi at the White House on Wednesday with Mr. Trump looking on.",
      "\"Have fun,\" Mr. Trump told Bondi after she was sworn in, later adding that Bondi will \"take crime out of the system.\"",
      "The new attorney general delivered brief remarks after taking the oath of office and said she is honored to lead the Justice Department.",
      "\"I will restore integrity to the Justice Department and I will fight violent crime throughout this country and throughout this world, and I will make America safe again,\" Bondi said.",
      "During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Bondi said she would \"not politicize\" the department and said \"justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country.\"",
      "\"If confirmed, I will work to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"Under my watch, the partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",

      "As attorney general, Bondi will oversee a sprawling department that includes numerous law enforcement components, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Both agencies have often been the target of attacks by Mr. Trump. The president selected another staunch defender, Kash Patel, to lead the FBI.",
      "Bondi will also have the power to investigate the federal probes involving Mr. Trump that were overseen by former special counsel Jack Smith. Smith resigned from the role before the president returned to office, and the two cases brought against Mr. Trump were dismissed because of longstanding Justice Department policy that precludes the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Now, with Mr. Trump back in the White House, his administration has been overseeing the ouster of certain Justice Department employees. Acting Attorney General James McHenry, selected by the president to temporarily lead the department, fired roughly a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for Smith because \"he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official said.",
      "And department leadership directed the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., Edward Martin, to terminate prosecutors who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to a Jan. 31 memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "At the FBI, which is a component of the Justice Department, the acting deputy attorney general ordered the acting head of the bureau to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned to the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack for review to \"determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "FBI supervisors have also received questionnaires for certain agents in their field offices that contain questions about their possible work on the Jan. 6 cases, such as whether they participated in a search, if they made any arrests or testified in court.",
      "Bondi has previously suggested that the Justice Department prosecutors who were involved in the cases against Mr. Trump would face their own investigation and has repeated the president's claim that there is a so-called deep state of career government employees working to undermine him.",
      "\"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them,\" she told Fox News after he was charged in 2023.",
      "Bondi takes the helm of the Justice Department without the federal prosecution experience that her predecessors have had. She served two terms as Florida's attorney general, during which her office led lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act and former President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "After leaving office in 2019, she worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for Ballard Partners, a Florida-based firm. During her tenure there, she represented corporations including General Motors, Amazon and Uber, and lobbied on behalf of the Qatari government, according to registration forms submitted to the federal government.",
      "Bondi briefly left her post at Ballard Partners to serve as a member of Mr. Trump's defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats in his first term. She defended Mr. Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which he pressured Zelenskyy to investigate former President Biden.",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans say they'll move forward with their own plan to approve key parts of the Trump agenda beginning next week, amid House delays.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans said Wednesday that they intend to move forward with their own plan to approve key components of President Trump's agenda beginning next week, as the House efforts to start the budget reconciliation process have stalled.",
      "\"It's time for the Senate to move,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Wednesday, after briefing Senate Republicans on the plan during their lunch meeting.",
      "Congressional leaders have been pursuing a massive legislative package through the budget reconciliation process to enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to pare government programs and address the debt limit. But top Republican leaders have appeared disjointed in how to proceed, prompting weeks of back and forth over whether to pursue a one- or two-bill approach.",
      "Until now, Senate Republicans had deferred to the House to kick off the process, though they generally advocated the two-bill approach that would include an initial effort to quickly secure a border win, while stressing that the tax legislation would take time to write and should be addressed in a separate measure.",
      "The budget reconciliation process allows Congress to fast-track certain types of legislation and avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But it's a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included. In order to approve legislation using budget reconciliation, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution, but the House has faced a backlash from conservatives in recent days over the legislation.",
      "Graham, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that while he appreciates \"what the House is trying to do,\" he thinks it's important to get the money to implement Mr. Trump's border security policy. He argued that \"one big beautiful bill,\" which Trump and House Republicans have said they prefer, is \"too complicated.\"",
      "\"It's important we put points on the board,\" Graham said, saying the president's plan on border security is \"running into a wall of funding.\" He said Senate Republicans are discussing a bill with $150 billion for border security that he said would be paid for.",
      "House Republican leaders outlined a timeline for the single-bill approach, which starts with the markup of a budget resolution that they aimed to hold this week \u2014 and a pledge to have the package on Trump's desk before May. The timing would fall within the first 100 days of Trump's second term, and allow for three vacancies in the House Republican ranks to be filled, improving their chances at winning approval for the bill.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Tuesday, as Senate Republicans began airing frustrations with the pace in the House, that \"we are well within the margins of time that we have to work on and I'm very optimistic about it,\" adding that \"we've made a lot of progress.\"",
      "\"The Senate will not take the lead,\" Johnson said. \"We're going to take the lead, and we're right on schedule.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters after Graham's comments Wednesday that he would talk to him, calling the South Carolina Republican a \"good friend,\" while underscoring that \"the House needs to lead this if we're going to have success.\"",

    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said.

Earlier in the day, all overseas missions for USAID had been ordered to shut down, and all staff recalled by Friday, multiple sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The statement notes that all \"direct-hire personnel\" will be placed on leave with exceptions for those on \"mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs.\" Those considered exceptions will be notified by USAID leadership by 3 p.m. ET Thursday, and further guidance on how to request an exception will be forthcoming, the email said.",
      "The statement notes the agency is developing a plan with the State Department to arrange and pay for return travel within 30 days for USAID personnel posted outside the U.S. The email states PSC (personal service contractor) contracts and ISC (independent service contractor) contracts \"that are determined to be inessential will be terminated.\"",
      "It also says they will consider \"case-by-case\" exceptions and return travel extensions based on \"personal or family hardship, mobility, or safety concerns.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, multiple USAID staffers based in the agency's Capital headquarters informed CBS News that they had received a separate email notifying them that they had been placed on paid administrative leave.",
      "Sources told CBS News that it was believed the letters had gone out to a vast majority of the headquarters' employees. A copy of the memo provided to CBS News notes that employees must remain \"available\" by telephone and email during business hours, but are prohibited from entering USAID buildings.",
      "Meanwhile, the newly appointed deputy administrator for the agency, Pete Marocco, met with State Department leadership on Tuesday and instructed them to get every USAID employee out of their respective countries worldwide by Friday, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Marocco said that if the State Department did not, the staff would be evacuated by the U.S. military, the sources said.",
      "USAID has more than 10,000 employees, with about two-thirds serving overseas, according to a Congressional Research Service\u00a0report. Some 1,400 work in the agency's D.C. headquarters. The agency maintains more than\u00a060 country and regional missions.",

      "But Dr. Atul Gawande, former USAID Global Health director,\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0the move to target the agency is \"dangerous for the country.\"",

      "Vance has proven to be essential in getting President Trump's most controversial cabinet nominees cleared through committees to a full Senate confirmation vote. Multiple Republican senators who were on the fence about supporting some of the president's picks have said it was Vance, their former Senate colleague, who helped them get them to yes on some of President Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana and a key swing vote, was uncommitted about voting for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department until he had \"intense\" conversations with the White House over the weekend.",
      "\"I want to thank VP JD specifically for his honest counsel,\" Cassidy said in a post on X as he and fellow members of the Senate Finance Committee assembled for their vote Tuesday. \"With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes.\"",

      "\"We identified \u2014 after looking at her hearing transcript, after a personal visit in the office, after a lot of answers to questions for the record \u2014 some gaps, and there was certain language I wanted her to embrace and her answers to reassure me that those national security gaps would be filled. And I worked with Vice President Vance, and he got me those the requested answers,\" Young told reporters.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, another prolific swing vote, has also complimented Vance and said she has spoken with him about policy.",
      "\"I think all of us who have served with JD have had conversations with him,\" she said. \"I've talked to him, for example, about the difference between our relationships with Canada, which is very important in my state, versus our relationship with Mexico and China.\"",
      "Vance introduced commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick at his confirmation hearing last month. And when it came to Trump's embattled nominee for defense secretary, Vance not only ginned up support for Pete Hegseth but also cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm him.",
      "Vance is particularly close to Senate Majority Whip John Barasso, who is responsible for counting votes and is considered an integral part of the team. While he only served in the Senate for two years before becoming vice president, Vance built key relationships in the chamber, and Republicans members view him a trusted colleague. He has been working the phones and talking to senators about their questions and concerns.",
      "But Vance is also not afraid to exert public pressure, too. He put Republican senators on notice last Wednesday after Kennedy and Gabbard testified before the committees that would vote on advancing their nominations.",
      "\"In their own way, both Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. represent parts of the new coalition in our party. To say they're unwelcome in the cabinet is to insult those new voters,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"To reject their confirmation is to reject the idea that President Trump decides his cabinet.\"",
      "Sources close to Vance say he won't have a traditional portfolio like other vice presidents, who are often tasked with taking on less desirable initiatives. Mr. Trump previously assigned former Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force in late February 2020 before the pandemic swept over the country.",
      "Instead, Vance is expected to be a jack of all trades, rather than serving in any specific area. An adviser close to Vance stressed that he is going to be a \"generalist\" focusing on all areas of policy and carrying out Mr. Trump's plans.",

      "In response, on Sunday, agents across the country were asked to complete questionnaires about their involvement in the Jan. 6 and Trump probes as part of a Justice Department evaluation of the workforce.",
      "According to a U.S. official familiar with the process, the FBI subsequently turned over the requested agent and personnel information to Justice Department leadership on Tuesday afternoon. Information like employee ID numbers and titles of 5,000 individuals were on the list, the official said.",
      "There is no indication yet about what actions the Justice Department may take against anyone on the compiled lists and so far, a handful of senior career officials have been fired, while rank-and-file agents remain on the job.",
      "The nine unnamed FBI agents who filed the first lawsuit on Tuesday alleged, \"The purpose for this list is to identify agents to be terminated or to suffer other adverse employment action.\"",

      "The Justice Department has not \"made any reasonable efforts to ensure that the maintenance and public release of the records at issue in this case are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for agency purposes,\" the lawsuit said, adding later, \"This bell cannot be unrung, and once the Plaintiffs' personal information is released it will be eternally available on social media.\"",

That decision, which mostly affected contract lawyers brought in on an interim basis to prosecute Jan. 6 cases, is not subject to the new lawsuit.",

      "The personnel moves make good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house at the Justice Department. Soon after taking office, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government.\"",

    "summary": "A group of transgender minors and their families filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive action restricting access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of transgender minors and their families filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that challenges President Trump's executive action restricting access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "The suit\u00a0was filed in federal district court in Maryland on behalf of two 12 year-olds who identify as transgender and five transgender teenagers who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, along with LGBTQ advocacy groups. They allege that Mr. Trump's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status.",
      "\"The Executive Orders were issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of preventing transgender people from expressing a gender identity different from their sex designated at birth \u2014 and expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people who, by definition, have a gender identity that does not align with their sex designated at birth,\" lawyers for the families wrote in their complaint.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure follows executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to promote gender ideology and declares U.S. policy as recognizing two sexes, male and female.",
      "Half of the states have in recent years passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July. The Trump administration is likely to reverse the government's position in the case.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the seven transgender individuals argues that Mr. Trump's executive orders involving gender identity are unlawful and unconstitutional because he is usurping Congress' authority by unilaterally seeking to withhold funding from medical institutions, providers and researchers that have already received congressional approval.",
      "\"Under our Constitution, it is Congress, not the president, who is vested with the power of the purse,\" they argued in their filing. \"The president does not have unilateral power to withhold federal funds that have been previously authorized by Congress and signed into law, and the president does not have the power to impose his own conditions on the use of funds when Congress has not delegated to him the power to do so.\"",
      "The challengers warn that Mr. Trump's directive to cut off federal funding for medical providers that offer gender-affirming care has already had \"concrete and immediate effects.\" In one instance, Children's National based in Washington, D.C., announced last week \u2014 on the heels of the president's order \u2014 that it would be pausing its provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth.",
      "In another instance, one of the plaintiffs, a 17-year-old from Virginia identified in filings as W.G., was set to continue receiving hormone therapy from doctors at Virginia Commonwealth University Health and Children's Hospital, but had her appointment canceled. The hospital receives more than $100 million in federal grants, according to the complaint, and announced it would be suspending gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 19 in response to Mr. Trump's order.",
      "NYU Langone Health in New York City, which received more than $5.6 million in federal grants over the last 12 months, treats several of the transgender youth involved in the lawsuit but canceled planned procedures for two of them, according to the filing.",
      "\"By directing agencies to withhold all federal funding from entities that 'promote gender ideology' and provide gender affirming medical care to patients under nineteen, the Gender Identity and Denial of Care Orders threaten the ability of medical institutions and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to provide essential health care to their communities, train the next generation of physicians, and support research to address this country's greatest health challenges,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote.",
      "They are asking the court to declare Mr. Trump's orders are unlawful and block their enforcement.",
      "The president has issued a slew of executive orders in his first weeks back in the White House covering a wide range of issues, from immigration to energy to gender identity. Many have already been the subject of court challenges, and more are expected as federal agencies begin taking steps to implement Mr. Trump's directives.",

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs manages a more than $350 billion budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals nationwide. It also manages national cemeteries and works closely with the Defense Department on personnel matters.",
      "Collins has promised to cut regulations across the department and elevate the quality of care for veterans.",
      "The challenges facing the department have evolved in recent years, with a younger generation of veterans bringing new health challenges from their service in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",
      "\"I'm an Iraq War veteran. I understand burn pits because I slept next to one for many months,\" Collins said in his opening remarks during his January confirmation hearing. Collins said that he understand the challenges facing veterans today who \"went time and time again, deployment after deployment\" to conflict zones.",
      "Collins served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021. He has been an outspoken conservative since his time in the Georgia state legislature and was a close Trump ally during the president's first term. He ran for Senate in 2020 but lost the Republican primary to Kelly Loeffler, a major GOP donor who Trump has tapped to lead the U.S. Small Business Association.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called Collins a \"friend\" who has \"an engaging personality that attracts people to what he's working on.\"",
      "\"It's not that they're better doctors or better psychiatrists or better nurses or technicians. It's that they're empathetic,\" Cramer said. \"While they appreciate access to community care, they appreciate the empathy of a fellow veteran, and Doug brings that. But, guys, he's a chaplain. I mean, come on, how perfect is that?\"",
      "Collins' nomination sailed through the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in a 18-1 vote. The lone dissenter, Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said she was concerned that Collins would limit access to reproductive care like IVF or abortion for veterans.",
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, said she had a productive conversation with Collins during his confirmation hearing but pressed him on whether he'd commit to working with Congress to \"strengthen and refine\" the department \"rather than resorting to privatization.\"",

    "summary": "Researchers used advanced technology to digitally \"unroll\" an ancient Greek text on carbonized papyrus, and now they're reading it.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",
      "Last year, the Vesuvius Challenge announced that three young students had won its $700,000 grand prize for using AI to help researchers read about 5% of another scroll, the subject of which was Greek Epicurean philosophy.",
      "The scroll that the team at the Bodleian Libraries recently unfurled is assumed to be on the same subject.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves,\" Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation at the Bodleian Libraries, told the BBC. \"There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 10:41:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",

    "title": "Risk of falling space junk impacting planes is growing, experts warn",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 11:16:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Some high-density airspace regions could have as high as a 26% of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket body reentry.",
    "story": [
      "Space debris plummeting back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a new study.",
      "The study authors, all affiliated with Canada's University of British Columbia, said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights. The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

      "A colossal explosion in the sky, unleashing energy hundreds of times greater than the Hiroshima bomb. A blinding flash nearly as bright as the sun. Shockwaves powerful enough to flatten everything for miles.",
      "It may sound apocalyptic, but a newly detected asteroid nearly the size of a football field now has a greater than one percent chance of colliding with Earth in about eight years.",
      "Such an impact has the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes.",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told AFP.",
      "What we know 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth -- its next close pass will not come until 2028.",
      "\"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero,\" said Betts.",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT -- more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft -- a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",

    "story": [
      "Since ChatGPT was released just over two years ago, its use everywhere from the workplace to academia has expanded significantly. In schools across the country, teachers and administrators have been grappling with how to contend with this new tool. While some say it has benefits, others point out the negatives, like cheating.",
      "This is leading to a divide in classrooms across the country with some teachers encouraging the use of AI and others voting to ban it completely.",
      "\"We believe very strongly that AI literacy, actually teaching kids in developmentally appropriate ways, what A.I. is and isn't and then how to use those tools responsibly, is a better approach than just outright AI banning,\" Amanda Bickerstaff, CEO of AI For Education, a group that provides what it calls \"AI literacy training,\" told CBS.",
      "A former high school biology teacher, Bickerstaff now works with educators across K-12 and higher to adopt AI in their classrooms so students can learn how to use the tool ethically. She believes students need to be prepared for both the short- and long-term changes technology brings.",
      "However, philosophy professor James Taylor from The College of New Jersey disagrees.",
      "Taylor told CBS that he was open to using AI at first. But, after seeing many identical essays, often full of false or misleading information that was obviously AI-generated, he decided to ban it.",
      "\"If you type in a prompt, boom! There's the answer. But that means the student has now outsourced all of their thinking to a machine. They haven't worked out and developed the skills themselves,\" Taylor explained.",
      "In Taylor's philosophy classes, students have to complete handwritten assignments without any devices. Rather than allowing AI to do all the work, students are encouraged to discuss their views, analyze others' arguments and come to a conclusion on what's right.",
      "\"Using it responsibly is important, but I think there has to be some classroom spaces where it's prohibited and its use is eliminated,\" Taylor said.",
      "\"As soon as it's banned, it's forbidden fruit,\" Bickerstaff pointed out. She believes kids will use AI in ways that could be harmful if parents and educators don't allow or encourage their use.",
      "Instead, she's teaching students and teachers how to write effective AI prompts, which she says will enhance learning, and how to verify AI outputs.",
      "While both Bickerstaff and Taylor may not see eye-to-eye on bans, they both believe in taking a proactive, balanced approach to AI.",
      "\"We're living through an inflection point unlike anything we ever lived before,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous in a lot of our tools, social media and devices. If you have a new iPhone, then you already have generative A.I. models that are in your hands.\"",

Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",

From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

Threatening media outlets with the revocation of their licenses for diverging from what he wants his minions to hear and actually pointing out the truth.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:38:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",
      "In addition to the human health threat posed by the virus, an unprecedented toll claimed by spillovers of the D1.1 from wild birds into chickens has driven up egg prices across the country.",
      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked if D1.1's spillover changes that risk assessment.",
      "\"It is critical that animal health biosecurity practices are enhanced to help prevent the spread of disease and protect animal and worker safety,\" state veterinarian Peter Rolfe said.",

It claimed Wallace suffered \"millions of dollars in reputational harm\" as a result of Lively's widely-reported legal battle with Justin Baldoni, who directed and starred opposite her in the film. Wallace is seeking at least $6 million in damages.",
      "Lively named both Wallace and Street Relations in an initial civil rights complaint that she filed in California before ultimately suing Baldoni and his production company Wayfarer Studios in New York federal court at the end of last year.",
      "Her complaint and lawsuit accused Wallace and his firm of participating in a retaliation scheme to intentionally damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out\u00a0 \u2014 allegations Wallace formally denied in his defamation action this week. Neither Wallace nor the firm are defendants in Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni.",
      "\"Wallace and Street were widely reported to be defendants in the Formal Lawsuit although they were not, the confusion having been sown by the Precursor,\" the defamation lawsuit read.",
      "In her New York lawsuit, Lively alleged that Baldoni's public relations team hired Wallace and Street Relations to orchestrate a digital campaign in order to turn public opinion against her. It suggested Wallace \"weaponized a digital army around the country from New York to Los Angeles to create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\" with the intention \"to eviscerate Ms. Lively's credibility.\"",
      "On Jan. 21, Lively filed a petition for deposition in Hays County, Texas, against Wallace alleging that she believe he was a subcontractor for a PR firm Baldoni is accused of hiring for the alleged smear campaign against her.",
      "Wallace's lawsuit said that Lively later filed to dismissed the petition because \"she knew of no facts to support the allegations against Wallace or Street.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Lively for comment.",
      "Lively first came forward with sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni in a December interview with The New York Times. Baldoni has since sued the publication and Lively for defamation. The latter sought $400 million from Lively and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy, while again attacking the Times.",
      "\"This lawsuit is a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team's duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media,\" said Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, in a statement to CBS News after filing the second suit.",
      "A spokesperson from the New York Times called Baldoni's allegations \"meritless\" in a separate statement and \"recycled from equally baseless claims\" included in Baldoni's earlier complaint against the newspaper.",
      "Lively's legal team characterized Baldoni's counter lawsuit as \"another chapter in the abuser playbook.\"",
      "\"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim. This is what experts call DARVO. Deny. Attack. Reverse Victim Offender,\" the team said in a statement. \"In short, while the victim focuses on the abuse, the abuser focuses on the victim. The strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively's complaint, and it will fail.\"",

      "The attorney general established a \"weaponization working group\" to review Biden administration law enforcement policies. The initial focus of the working group will be the Trump cases in New York \u2014 the indictment pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and civil enforcement action brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 neither of which involved federal prosecutors. The group will also review the two federal cases against Mr. Trump pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith and will examine the prosecutions of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "As the Justice Department has begun collecting information about the FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations and fired career prosecutors who worked on the cases, Bondi said in her directive that the working group would investigate \"improper investigative tactics and unethical prosecutions\" versus \"good faith actions by federal employees simply following orders.\"",
      "Bondi is also accusing the Biden administration of targeting Catholic Americans and parents at school board meetings, and abusing the FACE Act \u2014\u00a0passed in 1994 \u2014 which makes it illegal to harm, threaten or interfere with an individual \"obtaining or providing reproductive health services\" or damage a facility \"because such facility provides reproductive health.\" These efforts will also be reviewed by the working group.",
      "The new group will \"review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority in the United States\u2026 to identify instances where a department's or agency's conduct appears to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice or legitimate governmental objectives,\" Bondi wrote. She added that her department would provide quarterly reports to the White House on the group's findings.",
      "Bondi also targeted sanctuary jurisdictions with an order to end funding to any that \"unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.\" She encouraged the department to pursue enforcement actions against sanctuary cities or states that do not comply with the federal government's immigration efforts.",

      "Bondi also ended a moratorium on federal executions put in place by former President Joe Biden, who had ended federal executions during his presidency. In 2020, the first Trump administration carried out 10 executions after that had been paused for 17 years.",
      "\"Going forward, the Department of Justice will once again act as the law demands,\" a memo reads, \"including by seeking death sentences in appropriate cases and swiftly implementing those sentences in accordance with the law.\" The memo emphasizes that prosecutors should seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of a law-enforcement officer or a capital crime by an illegal immigrant.",
      "Another memo establishes a task force to \"prioritize seeking justice\" for the victims of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel perpetrated by Hamas, emphasizing that the department is investigating Hamas leadership, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), and \"U.S.-based individuals and entities that provide funding to Hamas.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, marking his latest move\u00a0targeting transgender rights.",
      "\"The war on women's sports is over,\" Mr. Trump declared at a White House event celebrating the mandate.",
      "The order, titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" mandates that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Those not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're putting every school receiving taxpayer dollars on notice,\" he said.",
      "A White House official who briefed reporters on the order before Mr. Trump signed it said transgender female athletes can compete on co-ed or male teams. Republicans have argued that transgender girls and women athletes have biological advantages that are unfair and unsafe for other girls and women.",
      "\"This is about preserving women's sports for women, and that if you are not a woman, you should absolutely have opportunities in sports, but the burden should not always be on women to accommodate that,\" the official said.",
      "The guidance will also affect U.S. visa policies for athletes who travel to the country to compete in the Olympics or other sporting events, Mr. Trump said. The U.S. will host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Mr. Trump was surrounded by young female athletes as he signed the order.",
      "The executive order follows a Republican measure that passed the House last month. The bill passed 218 to 206, with two Democrats joining the Republican majority.",
      "The House bill, known as the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,\" would amend Title IX to recognize a person's \"sex\" as \"based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" Schools that allow \"a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls\" risk losing federal funding.",
      "The bill has yet to see any movement in the Senate, where Republicans hold the majority and senators have been consumed with confirming Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees. It's also unclear whether the measure can amass seven Democratic votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster.",

      "\"We believe that's consistent with federal policy,\" Baker said in a contentious exchange with Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri about why transgender athletes were permitted to participate in women's sports. \"The clarity on this issue at the federal level would be very helpful.\"",
      "The NCAA said in a statement Wednesday that Mr. Trump's executive order \"provides a clear, national standard\" and its board of governors is reviewing the mandate and \"will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days.\"",
      "\"The Association will continue to help foster welcoming environments on campuses for all student-athletes. We stand ready to assist schools as they look for ways to support any student-athletes affected by changes in the policy,\" the NCAA said.",

      "Polling in recent years has found a lack of support for transgender athletes participating on sports teams that match their gender identity. About half of states limit transgender athlete participation.",
      "Mr. Trump underscored those feelings on the campaign trail, often talking about \"keeping men out of women's sports.\"",

    "story": [
      "Foodborne illness kills hundreds of Americans a year, sickens tens of millions annually, and costs billions in medical care, lost productivity and premature deaths, federal researchers said in a report.",
      "Roughly 10 million cases of foodborne illness each year in the U.S. are caused by six pathogens \u2014 salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing E. coli and norovirus, according to a coming study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illnesses result in about 53,300 hospitalizations and more than 900 deaths annually, according to CDC estimates cited this week by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).",
      "The economic impact of these diseases is severe, costing an estimated $75 billion (in 2023 dollars) annually, including costs associated with secondary chronic illnesses and conditions that develop after the initial illness, according to the findings published Monday by the GAO, which also cited research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.",
      "The actual count of people who get sick from eating food is unknown and likely far higher than official tallies, as only a small percentage of illnesses related to contaminated food is diagnosed and reported to public health officials. For every case of salmonella detected through a lab test, for example, 29 illnesses are caused by the bacteria, the CDC estimates.",
      "Last year, separate salmonella outbreaks linked to cucumbers and eggs sickened more than 200 people in dozens of states, while listeria outbreaks linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sickened 19, hospitalized 17 and killed two. An outbreak of E. coli in the fall of 2024 linked to organic carrots sickened 48 people in 19 states, killing one. Another linked to onions served in McDonald's burgers sickened more than 100 people in 14 states, resulting in one death.",
      "At least 30 federal laws govern the safety and quality of the U.S. food supply, both domestic and imported, and 15 federal agencies administer the rules, making for a \"fragmented\" oversight system, according to the GAO, a federal agency charged with supplying nonpartisan information to Congress. The GAO since 2007 has called for a national strategy to oversee food safety.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 17:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The use of generative AI in schools is causing a divide in classrooms across the country. While some teachers are using AI detection tools to catch cheating, others are banning it completely.",
    "story": [
      "Since ChatGPT was released just over two years ago, its use everywhere from the workplace to academia has expanded significantly. In schools across the country, teachers and administrators have been grappling with how to contend with this new tool. While some say it has benefits, others point out the negatives, like cheating.",
      "This is leading to a divide in classrooms across the country with some teachers encouraging the use of AI and others voting to ban it completely.",
      "\"We believe very strongly that AI literacy, actually teaching kids in developmentally appropriate ways, what A.I. is and isn't and then how to use those tools responsibly, is a better approach than just outright AI banning,\" Amanda Bickerstaff, CEO of AI For Education, a group that provides what it calls \"AI literacy training,\" told CBS.",
      "A former high school biology teacher, Bickerstaff now works with educators across K-12 and higher to adopt AI in their classrooms so students can learn how to use the tool ethically. She believes students need to be prepared for both the short- and long-term changes technology brings.",
      "However, philosophy professor James Taylor from The College of New Jersey disagrees.",
      "Taylor told CBS that he was open to using AI at first. But, after seeing many identical essays, often full of false or misleading information that was obviously AI-generated, he decided to ban it.",
      "\"If you type in a prompt, boom! There's the answer. But that means the student has now outsourced all of their thinking to a machine. They haven't worked out and developed the skills themselves,\" Taylor explained.",
      "In Taylor's philosophy classes, students have to complete handwritten assignments without any devices. Rather than allowing AI to do all the work, students are encouraged to discuss their views, analyze others' arguments and come to a conclusion on what's right.",
      "\"Using it responsibly is important, but I think there has to be some classroom spaces where it's prohibited and its use is eliminated,\" Taylor said.",
      "\"As soon as it's banned, it's forbidden fruit,\" Bickerstaff pointed out. She believes kids will use AI in ways that could be harmful if parents and educators don't allow or encourage their use.",
      "Instead, she's teaching students and teachers how to write effective AI prompts, which she says will enhance learning, and how to verify AI outputs.",
      "While both Bickerstaff and Taylor may not see eye-to-eye on bans, they both believe in taking a proactive, balanced approach to AI.",
      "\"We're living through an inflection point unlike anything we ever lived before,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous in a lot of our tools, social media and devices. If you have a new iPhone, then you already have generative A.I. models that are in your hands.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman, appointed by former President Joe Biden, agreed to grant a preliminary injunction sought by immigrants-rights groups after conducting a hearing on the request. The organizations, led by Maryland-based CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, filed a lawsuit arguing Mr. Trump's executive order targeting birthright citizenship violates the Constitution and federal law.",
      "\"This is a victory for our families, for our country, and for the Constitution of the United States. This is the level of fight that will be required for the next four years of the Trump administration,\" George Escobar, chief of Programs and Services of CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, said. \"The pregnant women who took this case up against President Trump \u2014 and so many immigrants across the country \u2014 can breathe easier knowing that their precious children are citizens and afforded the full rights that come with that.\"",
      "The suit brought in Maryland is one of at least eight that were filed in courts from coast to coast soon after Mr. Trump signed the order on his first day in office. Entitled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" the directive denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful residents.",
      "The immigrants-rights' groups are suing alongside five women who are pregnant and live in the U.S. They now fear their children will be denied U.S. citizenship because of their immigration status and that of their fathers, according to the filing.",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans say they'll move forward with their own plan to approve key parts of the Trump agenda beginning next week, amid House delays.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans said Wednesday that they intend to move forward with their own plan to approve key components of President Trump's agenda beginning next week, as the House efforts to start the budget reconciliation process have stalled.",
      "\"It's time for the Senate to move,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Wednesday, after briefing Senate Republicans on the plan during their lunch meeting.",
      "Congressional leaders have been pursuing a massive legislative package through the budget reconciliation process to enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to pare government programs and address the debt limit. But top Republican leaders have appeared disjointed in how to proceed, prompting weeks of back and forth over whether to pursue a one- or two-bill approach.",
      "Until now, Senate Republicans had deferred to the House to kick off the process, though they generally advocated the two-bill approach that would include an initial effort to quickly secure a border win, while stressing that the tax legislation would take time to write and should be addressed in a separate measure.",
      "The budget reconciliation process allows Congress to fast-track certain types of legislation and avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But it's a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included. In order to approve legislation using budget reconciliation, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution, but the House has faced a backlash from conservatives in recent days over the legislation.",
      "Graham, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that while he appreciates \"what the House is trying to do,\" he thinks it's important to get the money to implement Mr. Trump's border security policy. He argued that \"one big beautiful bill,\" which Trump and House Republicans have said they prefer, is \"too complicated.\"",
      "\"It's important we put points on the board,\" Graham said, saying the president's plan on border security is \"running into a wall of funding.\" He said Senate Republicans are discussing a bill with $150 billion for border security that he said would be paid for.",
      "House Republican leaders outlined a timeline for the single-bill approach, which starts with the markup of a budget resolution that they aimed to hold this week \u2014 and a pledge to have the package on Trump's desk before May. The timing would fall within the first 100 days of Trump's second term, and allow for three vacancies in the House Republican ranks to be filled, improving their chances at winning approval for the bill.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Tuesday, as Senate Republicans began airing frustrations with the pace in the House, that \"we are well within the margins of time that we have to work on and I'm very optimistic about it,\" adding that \"we've made a lot of progress.\"",
      "\"The Senate will not take the lead,\" Johnson said. \"We're going to take the lead, and we're right on schedule.\"",

    "summary": "Even next-door neighbors face starkly contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, as nation's home insurance crisis grows.",
    "story": [
      "Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\"I chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\" said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they'll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation's growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\"It changes the whole trajectory to your life,\" said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin's home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state's bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can't get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\"That's why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.'\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \"difficult but purposeful business decisions\" in California.",
      "Mercury didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson's case, and noted that it's difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \"wrap-around insurance\" for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn't cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn't cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\"Being able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\" Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\"Half the time, I feel like I'm doing something wrong,\" Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\"I could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It's just luck, really. It's nothing I did or didn't do,\" Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \"I had the same risk factors as everyone else.\"",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\"They're all trying to manage their exposure,\" Collier said. \"If you think about wildfires, you don't want concentrated exposure.\"",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn't get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \"actual cash value\" coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that's very, very painful,\" said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \"done everything the insurers asked California to do\" but yielded little success.",
      "\"We're marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we're not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\" Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California's fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California's largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\"There's a huge amount of risk in the system and there's a big question of who is going to pay for this,\" Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he'll have to take out loans to rebuild. He's considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility's equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can't fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he's thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\"I don't want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\" Wilson said. \"Stuck paying for an insurance that doesn't cover anything. You don't want to live in a risky area. You don't have the safety net.\"",

      "According to a report by a panel of the National Academy of Public Administration for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the inspector general report, the investigations concluded that the statement backing Mr. Trump was \"driven by external political pressure,\" through a \"request from the White House then-Acting Chief of Staff,\" and that Jacobs, the head of NOAA who has been nominated again, \"violated the Code of Ethics for Science Supervision and Management set forth in Section 7.01 of NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy when they failed to engage the Birmingham WFO in the development of the September 6 Statement.\"",

      "President Trump's move to tack an additional 10% tariff on U.S. imports from China could lead Mattel to hike the price of its Barbie, Hot Wheels and other toys.",
      "Mattel Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that roughly 40% of the company's toys are made in China, while noting that is less than the industry average of 80%. Overall, the fresh U.S. levies on Chinese good affect about 20% of Mattel's global production.",
      "\"Against the tariff, we have a range of mitigating actions,\" including \"potential price increases,\" he said.",
      "\"We do work closely with our retail partners to achieve the right balance and always keep consumers in mind when we consider pricing actions,\" DiSilvestro added.",
      "Mr. Trump has also imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, where Mattel sources almost 10% of its products, and on Canada. On Monday, the president paused those tariffs for at least 30 days after Mexico and Canada agreed to heighten security at their respective borders with the U.S.",

      "\"We're going to suffer as a small business, but so is everyone in this country,\" Dan Marshall, co-owner of family-run Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CBS News Minnesota this week.

    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",

      "Space debris plummeting back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a new study.",
      "The study authors, all affiliated with Canada's University of British Columbia, said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights. The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",

The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 21:30:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Americans are among those exposed to the virus in Uganda.",
    "story": [
      "Some health officials in the U.S. fear the shutdown of U.S. Agency for International Development missions may have disastrous results, as the stalling of foreign aid has forced delays in what they said was the \"chaotic\" early U.S. response to Uganda's swelling\u00a0Ebola outbreak.",
      "The outbreak marks Uganda's eighth from an Ebola virus. The first confirmed case in the outbreak was a nurse at a hospital in the nation's capital, Kampala, who contracted Ebola on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21 and died on Jan. 29.",
      "There are now six confirmed and six suspect cases. In two of the suspect cases, according to an internal slide shared with CBS News, health authorities have identified no epidemiological link to the other cases.",
      "More than a dozen Americans in Uganda are also among those so far known to have been exposed to Sudan virus, the type of Ebola that had infected the initial case. Those people so far have not shown symptoms, two people familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "There is no vaccine or treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for Sudan virus. This Ebola strain has been fatal in at least 41% of reported cases during past outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The new outbreak coincides with the Trump administration's pause in foreign aid \u2014 including its response to international outbreaks that could spread. This has spawned uncertainty among health nonprofits, which now face unpaid debts and a sweeping freeze on much of their U.S. funding.",
      "\"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world,\" Dr. Atul Gawande, a former USAID global health director, told CBS News on Monday.",
      "The pause has resulted in understaffed contact tracing and screening of departing international travelers in Uganda, one U.S. official said, since many experts funded by the U.S. around the region have been laid off or ordered to stop work.",
      "USAID is set to put virtually all its staff on leave this Friday and is shutting down overseas missions.",
      "\"It puts the world at risk,\" said one USAID official in a message. \"I'm not an alarmist, but this is very bad,\" the official added.",
      "In 2022, an outbreak of Sudan virus in Uganda prompted a large American response. The U.S.\u00a0ramped up\u00a0screening and preparedness for the virus here and sent\u00a0staff and resources\u00a0to aid Uganda's efforts to contain its spread.",
      "Uganda's healthcare system had already been stretched thin in recent months, battling a separate outbreak of a different disease \u2013 mpox \u2013 that has resulted in at least 2,031 cases, according to the WHO.",
      "Spokespeople for the State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump has also ordered the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO, which was paired with a demand for all U.S. government staff to immediately sever collaboration with the U.N. agency that is helping to coordinate the response within the country.",
      "A U.S. health official said that CDC usually works closely with the WHO and a country's health authorities, often meeting daily to coordinate the response to outbreaks like this.",
      "Despite the president's order regarding WHO, \"CDC has been cleared to speak one-on-one with WHO counterparts related to response activities in Uganda,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement. The CDC said such conversations are also allowed regarding responses to other outbreaks of concern in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Attempts by U.S. agencies to deploy staff to aid the outbreak response have also been delayed, one official said, amid government-wide pauses to travel and spending.",
      "More than 100 staff are currently working in the CDC's office in Uganda, a U.S. official said. Agency staff are also currently embedded within Uganda's response team. An additional team of CDC experts is expected to deploy to the country this weekend, another health official said.",
      "While officials secured a waiver on Saturday from the State Department to free up some funds for the Ebola response, many recipients of U.S. funds have been reluctant to accept the money because of the turmoil in Washington, two people familiar with the situation said.",
      "Nonprofits have also been grappling with a growing number of demands imposed by the Trump administration as a condition for receiving funds, like a sweeping order to purge all mentions of gender and diversity \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contractors\" supported by U.S. dollars.",
      "In Uganda, groups are still waiting for clarification from their in-country contacts at USAID about how the waiver would apply to their work, the people said, wary of incurring more expenses that might never be repaid.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's executive orders, the country's health ministry urged all staff backed by CDC and USAID to \"continue working in the spirit of patriotism as volunteers,\" in a letter obtained by CBS News, as Ugandan officials sought \"to restore normalcy.\"",
      "\"Radio silence\" from the CDC",
      "The growing outbreak in Uganda has also left some state and local health authorities befuddled with the \"radio silence\" from the CDC, officials told CBS News.",
      "In past outbreaks, CDC officials were quick to start ramping up preparedness for the possibility of cases spreading to the U.S.",
      "External meetings and information sharing that health authorities usually rely on to communicate with CDC officials were canceled amid the communications \"pause\" across the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The communications pause was initially expected to end this past weekend, but many federal health officials say they're still facing delays or denials in getting approval to publish information or participate in external meetings.",
      "\"HHS continues to increase staff levels as we look forward to the new Secretary leading the agency. HHS has approved numerous communications related to critical health and safety needs and will continue to do so,\" Andrew Nixon, the department's communications director, told CBS News in an earlier statement.",
      "As a stopgap, some states have been working on informal partnerships to ramp up their own preparedness for the arrival of potential cases, officials said.",
      "The CDC was able to publish a travel alert on Wednesday about travel to Uganda, but it left out links and information from the WHO's updates about the outbreak.",
      "Other donors stepping in",
      "Not all health experts are alarmed about the current situation.",
      "Two U.S. infectious disease physicians who have worked with outbreaks in the country expressed confidence that other groups and countries would be able to fill the void left by American support, but acknowledged they're concerned about the possibility of undetected spread and delays in the response.",
      "In past outbreaks of Ebola, the U.S. has often funded many of the key steps to contain the outbreak in its earliest days, including rushing to set up isolation facilities and support the outbreak response from an array of non-governmental organizations with workers in the country.",
      "U.S.-funded laboratories have usually been on the front lines of past responses to outbreaks, through institutions like the Uganda Virus Research Institute.",
      "Some groups, like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the WHO, have tried to cover the shortfall. The WHO recently touted its launch \u2014 with the help of Canada and Europe \u2014 of a vaccination trial in response to the outbreak.",
      "Russia may also help fill the vacuum left by the U.S. departure: state media recently said the nation had launched a mobile lab in Uganda's capital to help with the outbreak.",

    "story": [
      "Allies and adversaries of the United States reacted with shock and disapproval Wednesday to President Trump's announcement of plans for the United States to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion that the Palestinian territory \u2014 part of the land that many people hope will eventually become an independent Palestinian state \u2014 be redeveloped into a \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" owned by the U.S., sent diplomatic shockwaves around the world.",
      "Palestinians and Israeli hostage families react to Trump's plan",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement worried some Israeli hostage family members, and it drew immediate condemnation from Palestinian civilians and from Hamas, which warned it could threaten the fragile Gaza ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"We came very close to dying, but we survived with the grace of God,\" resident Moeen Mohsen told CBS News' team in Gaza City. \"Unfortunately, there came a decision to displace us. We reject it in its entirety. We are still holding on to our right to live.\"",
      "\"We will not allow prejudice to the rights of our people, which we have struggled for many decades and made great sacrifices to achieve,\" the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was quoted as saying by the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The PA has limited authority over the other, larger Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is run separately from Gaza.",
      "\"These calls represent a serious violation of international law, and peace and stability in the region will not be achieved without the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,\" Abbas said.",
      "Negotiations have begun over the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which has seen 18 hostages released by Hamas and other militants in Gaza since it came into effect on January 19, including one man who is an American citizen.",
      "In the current, six-week first phase of the deal, Hamas is to free more hostages every week in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners being released from Israeli jails.",
      "If the deal holds, the hostage and prisoner exchanges will continue, with a total of 33 Israeli captives set to be released during the first phase. If the agreement falls apart, those releases could come to an end, and that prospect has worried some family members of those still held hostage in Gaza.",
      "\"We are shocked. We didn't know about it, but it was clearly not a move pulled from the hip,\" Ronen Neutra, the father of Israeli soldier Omer Neutra, who was killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war and whose body is still being held in Gaza, told the Israeli news outlet Ynet on Wednesday.",
      "\"We want to remind Trump and Netanyahu that human lives are at stake, and we need to return them as a top priority, and only after that if we want to make changes,\" Neutra said.",
      "Hamas condemned Mr. Trump's plan, calling it \"a crime against humanity, and a reinforcement of the law of the jungle at the international level.\"",
      "The U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group said it was demanding \"urgent regional and international action to put an end to these malicious plans, because any attempts to implement such plans will destabilize security in the region and beyond.\"",
      "\"We demand that the mediators, especially the United States, oblige the occupation [Israel] to implement the ceasefire agreement in its three stages without procrastination or manipulation, as we are committed to implementing the agreement as long as the occupation commits to it, and any manipulation in implementing the agreement may cause it to collapse,\" senior Hamas political official Basem Naim said in a statement.",
      "America's partners in the Middle East reject Trump's Gaza plan",
      "Regional powers, including American allies that had already rejected earlier suggestions by Mr. Trump that the more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza be relocated to other countries, also spoke out against the plans the U.S. president iterated on Tuesday.",
      "Egypt's foreign ministry stressed the importance of a two-state solution to create a Palestinian nation.",
      "Jordan's royal court put out a statement as the country's King Abdullah II met with Mahmoud Abbas of the PA on Wednesday.",
      "\"His Majesty King Abdullah II stresses the need to put a stop to [Israeli] settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians,\" the statement said.",
      "Saudi Arabia quickly said it would not reestablish ties with Israel \u2014 a bilateral relationship that Mr. Trump has long hoped to foster\u00a0\u2014 without the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia rejects any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land,\" Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday. \"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has affirmed the kingdom's position in 'a clear and explicit manner' that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances.\"",
      "Reaction to Trump's Gaza plans from around the world",
      "Countries outside the Middle East also reacted swiftly to Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "\"France reiterates its opposition to any forced displacement of the Palestinian population of Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of international law, an attack on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians, but also a major obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilizing factor for our close partners Egypt and Jordan as well as for the entire region,\" French foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer reiterated Britain's support for a two-state solution when asked about Mr. Trump's plan during a parliamentary session Wednesday.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza \"must be allowed home. They must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuild on the way to a two-state solution,\" Starmer told Britain's House of Commons.",
      "Russia and China also both released statements Wednesday supporting a two-state solution.",
      "Israel's current government \u2014 its most far-right, nationalist leadership in decades \u2014 and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stood next to Mr. Trump as he made his plans public on Tuesday at the White House, have made it clear they are not interested in working toward a two-state solution.",
      "Dr. Sanam Vakil, Director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the British Chatham House think tank, said Mr. Trump's \"provocative\" comments \"could be trying to disrupt conventional thinking on a longstanding conflict that has yet to be resolved or produce viable solutions.\"",
      "\"He equally wants to show continued commitment to Israel to placate supporters and high-level donors in the United States and shore up Netanyahu's fragile political balance of power to help the prime minister engage in phase two ceasefire negotiations,\" Vakils said. \"More broadly, this is also part of his extreme deal-making strategy that will lay the ground for broader Israeli-Saudi normalization talks. He could be using this to pave the way to promote Saudi normalization in exchange for no annexation.\"",
      "Vakil said there was a risk that Mr. Trump's statements could, in the near term, lead to a delay in the release of further Israeli hostages in the current phase of the ceasefire.",

    "summary": "Sudan's civil war is starving millions of civilians, who rely largely on foreign aid that has come from the U.S. more than anywhere else.",
    "story": [
      "Omdurman, Sudan \u2014\u00a0It is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, but probably the one you've heard the least about. Fueled by nearly two years of civil war, Sudan is in the grip of a man-made famine.",
      "More than 25 million people are starving \u2014 more than half of the African nation's population \u2014 and of those, 3.2 million are children under the age of 5 who are suffering from acute malnutrition.",
      "Despite those harrowing figures, Sudan's brutal conflict is often called \"the forgotten war.\" It has raged in the shadows of other global conflicts, including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Aid organizations were already battling to address the country's devastating hunger crisis, and those organizations warn President Trump's 90-day suspension of U.S. foreign aid now threatens to turn the Sudanese disaster into an all-out catastrophe.",
      "For a moment in 2019, it seemed like a new era was dawning. A popular civilian resistance overthrew former Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir.\u00a0 But instead of a new civilian government, two rival generals, Mohamad Daglo, leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, and Sudanese army commander Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan joined forces amid the chaos and seized power in a military coup.",
      "Under their cooperation agreement, they were to hand over power to a new, elected civilian administration within two years. But that never happened. Instead, in 2023, they had a falling out and plunged the country into the brutal civil war that has raged ever since.",
      "The U.S. government has sanctioned both leaders, accusing Daglo's RSF of genocide and Burhan and the army of other war crimes.",
      "Inside the desperation caused by Sudan's civil war",
      "It took our CBS News team nearly two years to get the visas required to enter Sudan. Once inside, we had to drive 12-14 hours per day on some occasions to reach areas near the front lines, passing through dozens of checkpoints on the way.",
      "At each roadblock, armed forces demanded copies of our permits, passports and visas \u2014 we had printed over 100 copies for each member of the team, and we still had to print more.",
      "Some of the most intense fighting is now in places such as al-Gezira, al-Fasher and Darfur. Getting there is impossible, but what we found near the front lines was deeply distressing.",
      "In one of the many tent camps where thousands of displaced families have sought shelter from combat, we saw a newly arrived child in critical condition from starvation. We went out with UNICEF volunteers as they monitored the condition of children under the age of 3. Every single one they saw was severely malnourished, which means without intervention, they were at risk of dying.",
      "The worst cases are hospitalized, their tiny bodies simply wasting away. We saw children battling to breathe on their own, some so dehydrated they were too weak to cry.",
      "At the Al-Buluk Children's Hospital in Omdurman, just 12 miles from the fighting in the capital Khartoum, we met Dr. Mohammad Fadlala. The Cincinnati native is in Sudan as a volunteer with the Doctors Without Borders charity.",
      "\"I think we're in dire straits here in Sudan,\" he told CBS News.",
      "As we arrived, Fadlala was supervising a medical team that had just admitted 13-month-old Ibrahim Jafar. The doctors said the little boy was close to death and his eyesight was badly damaged from severe malnutrition.",
      "\"Severe acute malnutrition happens over time,\" Fadlala explained. \"It's where kids don't get enough nutrients\u2026They're unable to fight infections like normal. They're unable to utilize nutrition like normal\u2026And the majority of children who have severe acute malnutrition end up getting an infection and dying from it.\"",
      "Ibrahim's family had been trapped by fighting in the state of al-Gezira for months.",
      "\"There was no food,\" his grandmother, Neamat Abubaker, told us. \"At times nothing at all, not even water.\"",
      "She desperately wants the war to end. At one point, she broke down crying, worried they'd left it too late to flee the violence to save her grandson. It was a fear shared by every parent in the emergency ward.",
      "Doctors and nutritionists all told us the same thing: Without humanitarian aid and medical intervention, the children we saw in that ward would not be alive.",
      "Much of that aid has come from USAID, the decades-old U.S. government aid program that President Trump has frozen. As of September 2024, the Biden administration said it had committed more than $2 billion to the emergency response in Sudan, including a new promise of \u00a0$424 million in new humanitarian assistance \u2014 $276 million of which was being sent through USAID.",
      "America has also long been the biggest funder of the United Nations' World Food Program. CBS News visited a WFP warehouse in Port Sudan, on the country's Red Sea coast, and saw it stacked with tens of thousands of bags of sorghum, a type of grain. A lot of it was paid for by the U.S.",
      "The grain sacks had been gathering dust for more than a month while the WFP battled a debilitating bureaucracy, waiting for permission to transport them to those desperately in need.",
      "As rival warlords burn the country to the ground, everything has been weaponized, from sexual violence, to food. Both sides in the conflict have frequently prevented food aid from reaching millions of starving Sudanese.",
      "As if it wasn't already hard enough, WFP head of communications Leni Kenzli told CBS News that President Trump's 90-day foreign aid suspension could prove catastrophic for Sudan.",
      "\"The time to roll back funding is not now,\" she said. \"It's the time to step up funding.\"",
      "Asked if the people of Sudan could afford to wait for 90 days, Kenzli said, \"every single delay means lives are lost.\"",
      "\"We are extremely worried that when we finally get into these places at the scale we need to, it's going to be too late, and we're going to be digging up bodies instead of feeding them,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

    "summary": "Researchers used advanced technology to digitally \"unroll\" an ancient Greek text on carbonized papyrus, and now they're reading it.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",
      "Last year, the Vesuvius Challenge announced that three young students had won its $700,000 grand prize for using AI to help researchers read about 5% of another scroll, the subject of which was Greek Epicurean philosophy.",
      "The scroll that the team at the Bodleian Libraries recently unfurled is assumed to be on the same subject.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves,\" Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation at the Bodleian Libraries, told the BBC. \"There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious.\"",

The gunman's motive hadn't been determined by early Wednesday as the Scandinavian nation \u2014 where gun violence at schools is very rare \u2014 reeled from an attack with such bloodshed that police early on said it was difficult to count the number of dead among the carnage.",
      "Police chief Roberto Eid Forest, for the city of Orebro, about 100 miles west of Stockholm, where the tragedy played out, said Wednesday there was \"a lot to indicate that\" the gunman had shot himself, saying he was found already dead when police reached him.",

All were in serious but stable condition after being admitted to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Another woman was treated for minor injuries and was stable.",

      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",

      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft -- a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",

      "On whether U.S. troops would be sent to Gaza, the president said, \"As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that.\"",
      "\"We're going to take over that piece,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it'll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.\"",
      "The president was asked by a reporter what authority he has to take over a sovereign territory, and he replied that he's studied the matter closely for months.",
      "\"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president said his decision about taking over Gaza \"was not a decision made lightly,\" and he claimed he's received praise from other leaders in the Middle East, though he did not identify any by name. Two sources said later that top Trump aides knew in advance of Netanyahu's visit that the president planned to announce the proposal regarding U.S. ownership of Gaza.",
      "Leaders of several of the most powerful Arab nations previously said they strongly opposed any suggestion that residents of Gaza be resettled in other countries.",
      "Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said in a statement reported by the Reuters news agency Wednesday that the kingdom \"rejects any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land\" and wouldn't establish diplomatic ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman affirmed the kingdom's position in \"a clear and explicit manner\" that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances, the statement said.",
      "Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri was also quick to dismiss the idea out of hand, telling Reuters the president's \"remarks about his desire to control Gaza are ridiculous and absurd, and any ideas of this kind are capable of igniting the region.\"",
      "Hamas also called Mr. Trump \"racist\" and said his plan aims to \"eliminate the Palestinian cause,\" according to Agency France-Presse.",
      "Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat and the first Palestinian-American to serve in Congress, was blunt, asserting in a post on X that Trump was \"openly calling for ethnic cleansing.\"",
      "In the past, Mr. Trump has voiced support for a \"realistic two-state solution.\" Gaza, a 139-square-mile strip of land that shares borders with Israel and Egypt, has been fought over for years. Palestinians have been refugees for decades, since Israel gained control of it in the 1967 Six-Day War with Egypt, Jordan and Syria.",
      "Asked who would eventually live in Gaza once it's rebuilt, Mr. Trump said it should be an international place.",
      "\"I envision world people living there, the world's people,\" he said, adding that the residents should be \"representatives from all over the world, Palestinians, also.\" He said it would be \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump opened the news conference by reinforcing his warm relationship with Netanyahu, saying they had forged a successful partnership in his first term. He claimed that the last four years \u2014 under former President Joe Biden \u2014 had not seen as many successes.",
      "He claimed \"the grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East \u2026 the horrors of Oct. 7 would never have happened if I were president.\"",
      "In the wake of the massacre of Israeli civilians in 2023, however, Netanyahu praised Biden \"for his vital support for Israel.\"",
      "Netanyahu suggested Mr. Trump may be unconventional, but he has good ideas, and they work well together.",
      "\"After the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, 'You know, he's right,'\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu told reporters he found he had something else in common with Mr. Trump, too \u2014 he said Iran has tried to kill them both.",
      "Trump, Netanyahu meet in Oval Office before news conference",
      "Seated next to Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump repeatedly said he doesn't think Palestinians want to return to Gaza and said that he thinks Jordan, Egypt and other nations would accept Palestinians, even though they've said they won't.",
      "\"They are not gonna want to go back to Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that Palestinians would only \"end up dying\" there, and suggesting Palestinians should have a permanent settlement elsewhere.",
      "\"If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death, like what's happening in Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And right now you have in Gaza a very dangerous situation in terms of explosives all over the place, in terms of tunnels that nobody knows who's in the tunnel. The whole thing is a mess.\"",
      "The president said other \"rich\" nations should pay for a new home for Palestinians, although he did not expand on this suggestion.",
      "Netanyahu largely allowed Mr. Trump to speak. One reporter asked the Israeli prime minister whether former President Joe Biden or Mr. Trump is more responsible for the hostage and ceasefire deal.",
      "\"I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,\" Netanyahu replied.",
      "The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered in part by the U.S., continues to hold so far. Dual citizen Keith Siegel was the first American to be released since the implementation began last month, although other Americans have been released before.",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu said he would discuss \"victory over Hamas\" with Mr. Trump, as well as countering Iran and building on diplomatic relationships with Arab nations.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday that he has \"no guarantees that the peace is going to hold.\"",
      "The president's meeting with Netanyahu being his first with a foreign leader signals how the Trump White House views the U.S.-Israel relationship.",
      "\"Trump is going to continue his support for our great ally, Israel,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Fox News Tuesday.",
      "Waltz said the U.S. and Israel have \"more to go\" in terms of returning Americans held hostage. And the national security adviser said the U.S. has to think \"realistically\" about rebuilding Gaza.",
      "\"I would push back on the characterization of cleaning out Gaza,\" Waltz told reporters Tuesday. \"I think President Trump is looking at this from a humanitarian standpoint. You have these people that are sitting with literally thousands of unexploded ordnance and piles of rubble. You know, at some point we have to look realistically. How do you rebuild Gaza? What does that look like? What's the timeline? I think we, a lot of people, were looking at very unrealistic timelines. We're talking 10, 15, years, not the five years. And so that is what, that's what we have to work through. That's part of what we'll work through with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\"",

      "Sporting gloves and a red ribbon to ward off evil, Ecuadoran police raiding a drug den apprehensively inspect an altar to Santa Muerte \u2014 a Mexican \"death saint\" adopted by local gangs as their own talisman.",
      "The eerie statue of a skeleton shrouded in a cape \u2014 a scythe in her right hand and a globe of Earth in her left \u2014 is the latest in a fast-growing number of Santa Muerte shrines found in criminal hideouts in the western city of Duran.",
      "Offerings of money, tobacco, alcohol, figurines and religious paraphernalia were piled up at her feet by gangsters seeking the saint's protection.",
      "\"The belief is that when they entrust themselves to this Santa Muerte, they will not be caught or they will achieve their goal because Santa Muerte takes care of them,\" Duran police colonel Roberto Santamaria told AFP.",
      "Sometimes the offerings are more sinister.",
      "A former gang member told AFP some colleagues have been known to make human sacrifices too.",

      "Guardian saint of healing and protection",
      "Also known as The Skinny Lady or The White Girl, Santa Muerte is a guardian saint of healing and protection, and thousands of Latin Americans pray to her for safe passage to the afterlife.",
      "Believed to date back to 18th century Mexico, the saint gained a following of drug lords there. Last November in Mexico, two women and a boy were shot dead at an altar to La Santa Muerte.",
      "The saint was more recently adopted by Ecuadoran traffickers and hitmen in Duran \u2014 a city overrun by drug gangs that extort and terrorize locals.",
      "In addition to making offerings at altars, gang members tattoo the saint's likeness on their arms and wear amulets bearing her image around their necks.",
      "Santamaria said Santa Muerte came over from Mexico about six years ago when members of the Ecuadoran gang Los Choneros received training from the infamous Sinaloa cartel, which also transferred its otherworldly beliefs.",
      "Police in Duran estimate they had found altars to the saint in about six out of every 10 busts carried out in 2024.",
      "Los Choneros is one of 20 criminal gangs declared \"terrorist groups\" by Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa, seeking re-election Sunday as he leads a war on drug gangs blamed for a surge in violent crime in the once-peaceful South American country.",
      "Just last week, a leader of one of Ecuador's biggest crime syndicates, Los Lobos, was\u00a0arrested at his home\u00a0in the coastal city of Portoviejo. The\u00a0U.S. last year declared Los Lobos\u00a0to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "Noboa has declared a state of emergency and deployed troops in the streets and violence-riddled prisons, resulting in a slight dip in homicide rates in 2024 from the previous year. The president took action last year after gunmen stormed and opened fire\u00a0in a TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces. A prosecutor investigating the assault was later\u00a0shot dead.",
      "Officers scared to work around the altars",
      "Duran and the nearby city of Guayaquil are at the epicenter of Ecuador's violence, due in part to their proximity to the port increasingly used to send cocaine to Europe and the United States from neighbors Peru and Colombia \u2014 the world's top producers of the drug.",
      "Like Mexico, Ecuador is a largely Catholic country, and the Church condemns the practice of portraying death as a personality like in the case of Santa Muerte.",
      "However, most Ecuadorans have no problem reconciling the two, and Santa Muerte is being adopted by broader society as well, with depictions sold at markets or even online.",
      "This has prompted observers to worry that people with Santa Muerte items in their possession may be wrongly labeled gangsters amid the government crackdown.",
      "\"People are already being criminalized because of their race, because they are impoverished, now they will also be criminalized for popular customs,\" Ecuadoran social studies researcher Cristina Burneo told AFP.",
      "In further testimony to the saint's reach, Santamaria said many of his officers are scared to work around the altars.",
      "\"Police have told me that after the operations, they get headaches, begin to feel sick and feel dizzy,\" he said -- though he personally does not believe in the powers attributed to the saint.",
      "Police investigating crime scenes or conducting searches do not destroy Santa Muerte statues they come across, unless there is evidence they contain drugs or ammunition.",

      "President Trump has said part of his motivation for imposing now-paused tariffs on Canada was to force the country to crack down on illicit fentanyl trafficking \u2014 but very little of the synthetic opioid enters the U.S. through its northern border.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said\u00a0the tariffs, announced Feb. 1 on Mexico, Canada and China, were \"for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country.\" Mr. Trump said in a statement that it was \"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been paused for at least one month following negotiations, while a 10% tariff on China remains in place.",

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0estimated there were more than 74,000 fentanyl-related deaths in 2023 alone.",
      "How is fentanyl entering the United States?",
      "Most fentanyl enters the United States through Mexico, CBS News has previously reported. The\u00a0U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0has said Mexican cartels are \"at the heart\" of the United States' fentanyl crisis.",
      "Caulkins' analysis found 21 large fentanyl seizures along the Mexican border for every such seizure along the Canadian border.",
      "Often, illicit drugs are transported over the southern border by U.S. citizens passing through CBP checkpoints, Caulkins said. The U.S. citizens are usually hired by smuggler groups, which have in turn been hired by cartels and drug manufacturers.",
      "\"In general, it's not like it's a Sinaloa cartel employee walking across the border,\" Caulkins said. U.S. citizens are less likely to be seen as suspicious, he said, and they face fewer obstacles during the actual border crossing.",
      "Precursor chemicals at the border",
      "Precursor chemicals, or the ingredients used to make illicit drugs, have been seized in both Canada and Mexico, as well as within the United States. Precursor chemicals are largely manufactured in China and shipped overseas, usually to Mexico. The fentanyl is then produced, again typically in Mexico, and brought into the United States for distribution.",
      "In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of chemical precursors and fentanyl.",
      "In November 2024, Canadian police said they had dismantled the most sophisticated drug \"super lab\"\u00a0that they had ever seen in the country. They said they seized a \"massive\" amount of precursor chemicals from the facility in British Columbia, as well as 54 kilograms, or about 110 pounds, of fentanyl, along with other drugs.",
      "Police said they believed the lab was a mass production site where fentanyl and methamphetamine were made so they could be distributed in Canada and internationally. Officials did not say what countries the drugs may have been exported to.",
      "In December 2024, Canada said its health agency would create a \"Chemical Precursor Risk Management Unit\" that could \"provide better insight into\" the chemicals and their distribution channels. The unit would also be able to \"enhance monitoring and surveillance\" and allow for \"timely law enforcement action\" in connection to these chemicals. The unit was just one of several ways Canada said it would be fighting the fentanyl crisis.",
      "Health Canada is also set to accelerate its regulatory process for banning precursors \"so that border and law enforcement can take swift action to prevent their illegal importation and use.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal authorities have released a pair of seeking information posters for two Iranian intelligence officers accused of authorizing the 2007 abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert Levinson. The posters come as part of a decades-long investigation into Levinson's disappearance, the FBI's Washington field office said Tuesday, noting their \"commitment to resolving the case for his long-suffering family.\"",
      "Since Levinson vanished, the United States has maintained the view that he was abducted during an unauthorized CIA mission in Iran and held wrongfully by the Iranian government. The former agent was thought to be alive until U.S. officials said in 2020 that intelligence suggested he may have been dead for \"some time.\"",
      "The posters include images of Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, the Iranian senior intelligence officers believed to be responsible for Levinson's abduction, subsequent detention and probable death. The men are described as high-ranking officers in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to the FBI.",
      "Levinson has not been seen or heard from since March 9, 2007, one day after the retired agent traveled to the Iranian island of Kish, according to the FBI. U.S. officials say Levinson's family received video and photographs of Levinson in anonymous emails several years later, in 2010 and 2011, which showed him in captivity. They ultimately released the footage and an image publicly but could not trace the emails back to their senders.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Baseri and Khazai under the Trump administration in 2020, the first time the country formally blamed Iran for Levinson's disappearance. At the time, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that Iranian officials \"authorized Levinson's abduction and detention and launched a disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the regime.\"",
      "His statement identified Baseri and Khazai by name.",
      "The U.S. has also accused Iran of sanctioning the scheme that resulted in Levinson's abduction and claimed its government knew the missing agent's location and lied about it for nearly 18 years.",
      "Federal officials claim Baseri has been involved in counterespionage activities within and outside of Iran, in addition to sensitive investigations related to Iranian national security, and \"has worked directly with intelligence officials from other countries to harm U.S. interests.\" Khazai has allegedly led Iranian intelligence and security delegations to other countries, the FBI said.",
      "The State Department is offering a reward of up to $20 million for information that leads to Levinson's recovery and return, while the FBI put forward a prize of up to $5 million for the same.",
      "\"The FBI remains steadfast in our commitment to return Bob to his family,\" said Sanjay Virmani, special agent in charge of the counterterrorism division at the FBI's Washington field office, in a statement.\u00a0\"Our extensive investigation continues to develop new leads and intelligence, and we will pursue all options to hold every Iranian official involved in his abduction accountable.\"",

      "\"It also regulates the metabolism of glucose and fats in the brain, the activity of neurotransmitter channels and brain cholesterol synthesis,\" Hornberger said.",
      "Neurons also use glucose to send information to nerves, which helps control the body\u2019s movements, but excessively high sugars may affect neuronal activity and lead to cognitive issues, according to the doctor.",

      "The Trump administration's plan to detain some of the most dangerous illegal immigrants arrested in the United States in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could raise legal concerns and challenges, which could slow efforts to deport them to their home countries, experts say.",

      "Among the uncertainties of the plan, what's inevitable is that those detained will most likely file petitions for a writ of habeas corpus, which asks a judge to review the legality of the prisoner's detention, said Eugene Fidell, a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School who teaches a course on military law and Guantanamo Bay.",
      "\"Nothing has changed in terms of that basic guideline, which means that the writ of habeas corpus, which is protected by the U.S. Constitution in so many words, applies there,\" Fidell told Fox News. \"And what that means is that the people who are being taken to Guantanamo as part of the administration's current effort are going to have access to the United States District Court.\"",

Because we were invaded for the last four years under Joe Biden,\" Hegseth added. \"Tens of millions of people entered our country. We have no idea who they are.

The ruling has played a factor that has slowed the government's ability to complete the prosecution of Mohammed and the other 9/11 planners.",
      "\"This is not a convenient venue,\" said Fidell. \"It's not a venue that insulates the government's activities from the oversight of the federal courts.\"",
      "Fidell noted that previous administrations have resisted efforts to get the federal court to exercise oversight of Guantanamo, resulting in a series of court cases, notably the U.S. Supreme Court case of Zadvydas v. Davis, noting that those cases dealing with the indefinite detention of illegal immigrants could apply.",
      "\"What you're going to see is an intersection of habeas corpus law generally with the very robust body of law that has grown up over the years in the immigration field,\" he said. \"And the notion that people can be held for prolonged periods of time is one that I think is going to meet with a lot of resistance in the courts.\"",

      "\"Congress is going to have to appropriate some money because it's not going to be free for the taxpayers,\" he added. \"I think this is a battle that's going to be fought out not at Guantanamo.

This provides a more secure second layer of verification, as authenticator apps are less vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks and interception compared to text message-based authentication. Choose\u00a0reputable authenticator apps, which generate time-based one-time passwords that change frequently and are tied directly to your device.",

      "A new era of transportation",
      "Whoosh isn't your typical gondola or cable car system. While it may look similar at first glance, this clever Kiwi invention offers a unique blend of on-demand service, direct routing and privacy that sets it apart from traditional public transportation. Unlike fixed-route gondolas, Whoosh pods are equipped with their own motors and autonomous navigation systems. This allows them to freely traverse a complex network of cables and rails, choosing the most efficient path from one point to another without intermediate stops.",

      "The Whoosh system combines the best aspects of ride-sharing and public transport. Users can book a pod through an app, much like calling an Uber. The pod will be waiting at a nearby station, ready to whisk you away to your destination. These stations are designed with minimal footprint, fitting into a standard car park space and featuring a spiral ramp up to the network height of about 40 feet above the ground. Larger stations can be built at ground level, offering easy access for passengers.",
      "The network itself consists of tensioned cables spanning 500-985 feet, interspersed with shorter sections of steel rail for smooth turns and junctions. This design allows Whoosh to overcome geographical obstacles with ease, crossing rivers, highways or even connecting rooftops.",

      "Whoosh pods are expected to achieve an average speed of 25 mph across the network. While this may not sound impressive at first, the non-stop nature of the journey means it could be significantly faster than driving through congested urban areas. The system features remarkable efficiency, using less energy for a standard ride than a 10-minute shower. This is achieved through constant motion and low rolling resistance, making Whoosh about twice as efficient as a small electric car. Comfort hasn't been overlooked either. The pods can lean into corners, much like a motorcycle, providing a smooth ride even at higher speeds. The cable sections of the journey offer an especially pleasant \"floating\" sensation.",

Nestled between mountains and a lake, Queenstown suffers from limited road networks and significant traffic congestion, making it a perfect proving ground for Whoosh's innovative transportation solution. The pilot project will demonstrate the system's ability to navigate difficult terrain and provide efficient transit in a compact urban environment, with Chris Allington noting that the location is \"small enough that it's actually solvable\" while presenting unique geographical challenges.",

Sketchy ticket resellers flood search results and social media with deals that seem too good to be true. Online ticket fraud is becoming increasingly common. While some tickets may be legitimate, many are not, with fans spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for nothing.",
      "Scammers often utilize automation and artificial intelligence to identify and target potential victims based on the language used in their posts. For instance, scammers search for popular buzzwords and hashtags that people use when looking to buy tickets, such as #SuperBowl, #SuperBowlTickets or #LookingForTickets. They then respond to these posts with messages that contain links to other platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or Cash App, where they attempt to finalize fraudulent deals.",

These scams appear everywhere, promising fans exclusive giveaways if they cover a small shipping fee or provide personal details. The posts look official, sometimes even using fake endorsements from players or teams, making them easy to fall for.",
      "Scammers also use cross-platform operations to evade detection and bans by social media platforms. They will identify and initiate communications with you on one social media platform before requesting you switch to another. This is likely an attempt to prevent one social media platform from gaining full insight into fraudulent activity and banning accounts.",

They may state they just want to sell the tickets \"last minute\" to justify large, attractive discounts, such as 50% off or more. They may also claim to have a personal or professional reason for not being able to attend the event, such as a family emergency or a work conflict.

Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at\u00a01Password, shared some tips on staying safe leading up to the games. These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are always looking for new ways to take advantage of football fans, especially during major events like the Super Bowl. Whether it is fake ticket sales, phishing scams or bogus giveaways, the risks are real. You can easily avoid becoming a victim of these types of attacks by staying vigilant and being cautious of emails and links that ask for personal information.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",
      "Elon Musk scam email ads (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Red flags to watch out for",
      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

      "Apple has\u00a0uncovered hackers exploiting a vulnerability in iOS that appears to have been lingering for more than a year. The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection. The prolonged stealth of the campaign underscores the challenges of identifying sophisticated, narrowly tailored exploits.",
      "This underscores the critical need for you to update your devices to iOS 17.2 or later, as these versions include essential fixes to safeguard against this actively exploited vulnerability.",
      "Apple's iOS 17.2 update included patches for several vulnerabilities. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Apple\u2019s response to the vulnerability",
      "In response, Apple has released fixes across its ecosystem, including iOS 18.3, macOS Sequoia, watchOS, tvOS and VisionOS. You should update your devices as soon as possible to stay protected. To install the update on your iPhone or iPad:",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings.Tap\u00a0General.Click\u00a0Software Update.Click\u00a0Update Now or Update Tonight.",

      "7 ways to keep your iPhone safe",
      "Protecting your iPhone requires proactive security measures. By following these seven essential steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats and keep your personal information secure.",
      "1. Keep your iPhone updated:\u00a0I can\u2019t say this enough.\u00a0Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.",
      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",
      "Open\u00a0Settings.Scroll down and click\u00a0Apps.\u00a0Tap\u00a0Messages.Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "This iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.",

      "A rise in high-profile home invasions, allegedly carried out by Chilean migrants, has security experts warning Americans about South American burglary rings targeting U.S. homeowners.",
      "Prominent targets in the last few months have included NFL stars Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Joe Burrow. Four Chilean nationals have been charged in the December burglary of Burrow's Ohio home, an investigation that led to two more arrests Tuesday as authorities searched a pawn shop in New York City's Diamond District.",
      "\"This is one of the first times we actually heard about an athlete's home being hit while they were playing football. So this just kind of started, but it's now kind of escalating to not only just athletes, but it's escalating to wealthy people,\" Michael Barbieri, a law enforcement veteran who works as an investigator with Global Intelligence Consultants, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"They gather intelligence information that's going to help them commit the crime. And that's exactly what's going on. And they're very good at it. And they take their time. They just don't go breaking into anyone's home. They take their time, and they find the people where they believe have the most that they can steal from.\"",
      "Barbieri explained that homeowners need to be more vigilant as a growing trend in migrant burglary rings is on the rise.",
      "\"Most of the time we think of cartels as smuggling drugs and people and everything else into our country. But what we're looking at is a cartel, that is zeroing in on very, very wealthy people. They use surveillance, they use trackers. They use everything you could possibly imagine,\" Barbieri explained.",
      "\"They wait until that person either leaves town or is at work or, in the case of professional football players and any other professional athlete, is on TV. So they know exactly where he's at before they break into his home,\" Barbieri said in reference to Burrow's case.",

      "\"They look for high-end cars. Somebody driving around in a Rolls-Royce, or driving around a Bentley, or driving around in a Mercedes-Benz and they have the ability to gather the license information, and they pay someone probably to run those plates to determine where that person lives,\" Barbieri explained on how these criminals are finding their targets.",
      "\"They either put a tracker on the vehicle to make sure that that's where he lives, and then they do counter-surveillance on these people so they know exactly what's going on in their lives. They know when they go to work, they know when and where they go to lunch, they know how long they're out for lunch. These are things that are part of a surveillance team that they have.\"",

      "\"It's a sophisticated system that we're really looking at. We're not looking at a bunch of guys who just strolled across the border, and they don't know what they're doing. They know exactly what they're doing,\" Barbieri said.",
      "In Burrow's case, the investigation led authorities to search a pawn shop in Manhattan on Tuesday, where they \"seized large quantities of suspected stolen property, including dozens of high-end watches and jewelry. Law enforcement also recovered large quantities of cash and marijuana,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York said.",
      "Officials said they also found \"large quantities of luxury goods and clothing, including high-end handbags, wine, sports memorabilia, jewelry, artwork and power tools consistent with those commonly used in burglaries and opening safes\" in a New Jersey storage facility.",
      "Two men, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar. were arrested in Tuesday's operations, accused of acting as \"fences\" for South American-based crime groups targeting luxury heists across the United States.",
      "They are accused of buying stolen luxury goods from burglary crews and then reselling them for almost five years.",
      "\"The defendants\u2019 alleged actions incentivized highly organized South American Theft Groups to continue their meticulous looting scheme against a myriad of affluent residences and businesses across the country,\" James E. Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, said in a statement.",

      "Barbieri said he is hopeful that President Donald Trump's border security plan will help decrease these crimes, but said we are still dealing with the large amounts of cartels who have already crossed into our country and are wreaking havoc.",
      "\"We're now trying to round them up, but we're not going to get to all of them that fast. A lot of them are sending these things back to their countries of origin. So if they're from Venezuela or if they're from Caracas or if they're from some other place, Mexico City, then a lot of these guys are cashing these things in that they are stealing and sending the money back to their country or to their families,\" Barbieri explained.",

      "\"They have some sophisticated ways to get rid of the merchandise that they have stolen. You just can't go down the street and turn it in because somebody will immediately turn you in. So they have a network of places that they are dropping these items off at, and they're gathering the cash for them.\"",
      "Barbieri shared that these cartels are sending the stolen merchandise by plane and to other countries, which is making it nearly untraceable.",
      "\"In the end, it's difficult to run that down. It's almost impossible to run down,\" Barbieri said about locating the stolen merchandise.",

      "He also recommended investing in a gun or weapon of some sort to better protect yourself from harm.",
      "\"Make sure you have some sort of weapon that you can protect yourself in your home against these people because these are violent criminals. These are not your normal guys that are just hanging around a school lot. These guys are violent criminals. They come from a violent country where there is no law and order. So that's what you need to be prepared for,\" Barbieri warned.",
      "Barbieri added another way Americans can protect themselves from becoming a victim of these home invasions is to fully vet anyone they hire and do a background check, which he acknowledged could be difficult, because some of these criminals have an inside connection to the homes they are stealing from.",
      "\"They're gathering intelligence from inside your own home from somebody who has already been there. I mean, you don't break into somebody's house and go through two sets of gates if you don't know the combinations. And that's exactly what happened to Patrick Mahomes,\" Barbieri said.",

      "Mansharof continued, \"While Biden tightened sanctions, he did not enforce them, allowing Iran to continue profiting from oil exports, providing critical support to its economy. This approach reflects a flawed strategy of attempting to engage Ali Khamenei [the supreme leader of Iran] diplomatically while ignoring Iran\u2019s oil smuggling.\"",

      "The history of Gaza that Trump was referring to is both a long and tumultuous one.",
      "Gaza\u2019s history dates back nearly 4,000 years, frequently appearing in biblical narratives. It was one of the five key cities of the Philistines, who arrived from the Aegean, known for their clashes with the Israelites. The story of Samson, who tore down a Philistine temple, is one of the earliest recorded tales of destruction and rebuilding in Gaza. Over centuries, it was conquered by the Egyptians, Babylonians and Persians, each bringing new rulers and forcing population shifts. Even then, Gaza was a land where people came and went, often not by choice.",
      "Under the Ottoman Empire (1517\u20131917), Gaza was a military stronghold. The Ottomans used it as a buffer zone, and while some periods saw growth, it was frequently abandoned during wars. In 1799, Napoleon\u2019s forces briefly occupied it before retreating. Once again, Gaza was left in ruins, and its population had to start over.",

By 1948, when Israel declared independence, thousands of Palestinian refugees fled to Gaza, turning it into an overcrowded enclave under Egyptian rule.",
      "From 1949 to 1967, Egypt controlled Gaza but never integrated it. Palestinians living there were not granted Egyptian citizenship, and Gaza remained impoverished and politically unstable. When Israel captured it in the Six-Day War, the cycle of displacement and destruction resumed.",

Soon, hundreds of thousands of Gazans would enter Israel daily for work, and Gaza's economy became tied to Israel's, but hostility persisted.

Since then, Hamas has engaged in repeated attacks on Israel, leading to destruction and humanitarian crises. With Hamas prioritizing terrorism over governance, Gaza has remained in a state of war and siege. Today, it is one of the most densely populated places in the world, with 2 million residents.",

      "As European Union leaders convened for a meeting in Brussels, Frederiksen addressed President Donald Trump's prospect of acquiring control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally, through military or economic force.\u00a0\"I think we have been very clear from the Kingdom of Denmark, with great support from the European partners and the European Union, that everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it is a part of our territory, and it's not for sale,\" Frederiksen told reporters, speaking in English. \"The chairman, the leader of Greenland, has been very clear that they are not for sale.\"",

They [the U.S.] are already there, and they can have more possibilities. And at the same time, we are willing to scale up from the Kingdom of Denmark. And I think NATO is the same. So if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward.\"",

      "\"You have to ask yourself, how are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security if that means that we need to take more territorial interests in Greenland? That is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us. He cares about putting the interests of America's citizens first,\" Vance said, adding, \"You've got probably 55,000 people living on Greenland who are not actually happy with Danish government. They've got great natural resources there. They've got an incredibly bountiful country that the Danes aren't letting them develop and explore. Of course, Donald Trump would take a different approach if he was the leader of Greenland.\"",

There will not be an extension of this program.\u201d",
      "More than 40,000 people have taken the buyout offer so far, according to a White House official, out of a federal workforce of over 2 million people.",
      "There is deep concern among federal workers that the Trump administration\u2019s buyout offer could turn out to be a bait-and-switch, with the government potentially failing to hold up its end of the bargain. Education Department managers\u2019 comments only worsened those concerns, the three employees said.",

      "A third employee described the tone of the call as angry, as workers put questions in Zoom\u2019s chat box but then did not get responses.",
      "The unusual buyout offer has upended Washington amid a flurry of executive orders and maneuvers by Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is head of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, an office within the White House. In just two weeks, Trump and Musk have launched a sweeping effort to remake the federal government, slash spending and even eliminate some agencies.",
      "Many Democrats and some Republicans say Trump and Musk are violating constitutional limits on the presidency in ways that are unlawful and that are precipitating a constitutional crisis.",
      "Some labor unions for federal workers have sued to stop the deferred resignation program, arguing that the Trump administration does not have legal authority to offer such buyouts. Federal government labor unions and Democratic state attorneys general have warned federal workers that they may never receive the promised resignation benefits and characterized the offers as an attempt to intimidate them into quitting.",
      "Trump has nominated Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO and head of the Small Business Administration in his first administration, to be education secretary. No confirmation hearing is scheduled yet.",
      "Other staffing changes coming to the Education Department may arrive before McMahon does. The department expects to conduct layoffs, known as Reductions in Force, the three department officials said they were told during Wednesday\u2019s meeting. Oglesby, the chief of staff, and Clay, the human capital officer, did not say when those will take place or which offices will be hit hardest during the meeting.",
      "Education Department staff members will also need to go into the office daily by Feb. 24. Clay told staff members that department leaders are working to find another federal building for remote employees to work from within 50 miles of their homes.",
      "Trump has said he wants to eliminate the Education Department, which would fulfill a longtime dream of the Republican base but is supposed to take an act of Congress to achieve.

      "DENVER \u2014 Heavily armed federal agents raided apartment buildings across metro Denver early Wednesday in a search for Venezuelan gang members and other migrants under the Trump administration's mass deportation effort targeting major cities.",
      "At least two dozen officers carrying high-powered weapons stormed several complexes before sunrise. In some cases, they were backed by large, military-style vehicles.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said on social media that it was targeting 100 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua for arrest and detention. It did not say how many people were taken into custody.",
      "The operation included officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the FBI; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The administration has said that its main targets are convicted criminals but that noncriminals could also be detained during raids.",
      "Witnesses said that they were caught off-guard by the agents descending on their homes and that many hid in their apartments, afraid federal agents would barge in. Many refused to answer their doors when officers knocked.",
      "At an apartment complex in Denver, a 31-year-old Venezuelan man said that shortly after 5 a.m., ICE agents and other federal officers began yelling and loudly banging on every door.",
      "The man, who asked that his name be withheld because he was afraid of being deported, said residents discreetly peered out their windows as large trucks and unmarked vehicles entered the parking lot.",
      "Several residents said eight people were arrested at the complex.",
      "People \u201chid with fear,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t open their doors\u201d and remained \u201cquiet without saying anything,\u201d he said after all the agents had left.",
      "He said many of his neighbors have pending asylum applications or other forms of temporary protection from deportation, \u201cbut none of that matters to them,\u201d referring to immigration authorities.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if even with having an asylum case, they\u2019ll just take us and deport us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re living with fear and uncertainty because we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll come back for us.\u201d",
      "Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement that he was aware an immigration enforcement action was taking place at a Denver apartment complex.",
      "\u201cWe are in contact with Denver Public Schools and other city partners and have confirmed that there has not been any activity in schools, hospitals, or churches,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cDenver Police and city authorities were not involved in these actions, nor were we given prior notice. We will continue to monitor these activities throughout the day.\u201d",
      "A Colombian immigrant at the Cedar Run apartment complex, one of three that was raided in nearby Aurora, said he was leaving the building around 7 a.m. to take his daughter to school when he saw a large number of federal agents surrounding the building.",
      "He immediately turned around and went back upstairs to his apartment. Federal agents walked the hallways of the building for several hours, repeatedly knocking loudly on doors, identifying themselves as \u201cimmigration\u201d and asking people to come outside.",
      "The immigrant and his family opted to remain silent and not open their door.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like they were knocking on every door in our hallway, but nobody opened,\u201d said the man, who asked that his named not be used because he feared retaliation from federal authorities. He lives with his wife and daughters. \u201cWe just stayed inside and stayed quiet.\u201d",
      "Carlos Rodriguez, a Venezuelan immigrant who previously lived at the Edge at Lowry apartments, where a viral video was recorded last year showing armed men, allegedly Tren de Aragua gang members, going door to door, said the raids have made him reconsider his desire to live in the United States.",
      "\u201cI want to go back to Venezuela, I really do,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe going out in the street anymore.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, which is part of a rapid response network of local advocates that sends legal observers and advisers to ICE operations, had volunteers present at the Cedar Run apartments.",
      "Raquel Lane-Arellano, the group's communications manager, said that legal observers repeatedly asked agents to show a search or arrest warrant but that none was provided. The observers saw agents numbering in the dozens and a bus to transport arrestees on the scene, but they saw only a handful of arrests, she said.",
      "The people who were apprehended and spoke to legal observers on the scene identified themselves as coming from several countries, including some in Africa, Lane-Arellano said, adding that it raised questions about ICE's stated intention to target Tren de Aragua members from Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this allegation of gang affiliation, but there are no criminal charges that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just an immigration raid with loose allegations that are seemingly unsupported.\u201d",
      "At another complex in Aurora, agents arrived when it was still dark and knocked on all the doors as terrified migrants hid inside their homes, said a 37-year-old Venezuelan asylum-seeker, who asked that his name not be used because he feared deportation.",
      "\"We didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knocked so hard they could have broken down the doors.\u201d",
      "He said that no one opened their front doors and that he did not know whether agents were targeting criminals or looking for specific people. He said he was not aware of anyone on his floor\u2019s being arrested.",
      "\u201cWe are not criminals,\u201d he said, adding he had heard that ICE was also \u201ctaking people with papers.\"",

      "\u201cI cannot go back,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same building, a 22-year-old Venezuelan migrant reiterated that officers knocked loudly on all the doors and that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t open them out of fear.\u201d",
      "The man, who also asked that his name be withheld, said he has an open asylum case but is afraid he could be deported anyway.",
      "At another apartment complex in Aurora, a Venezuelan migrant said officers knocked on doors in the early morning but not his.",
      "The man, who asked that his name and age not be used because he feared deportation, said he had planned to leave his apartment Wednesday but decided to stay home after he heard ICE was going around and \u201ctaking some of my neighbors.\u201d",
      "He said he hid in his room and was too afraid to peek outside to see what was happening.",
      "Hours after the raids, residents could be seen rushing away from their complexes. Several residents ducked around corners and quietly went in and out of their units to avoid being noticed.",
      "\u201cICE is looking for everyone,\u201d the 22-year-old Venezuelan said. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking for people who are helping the United States, working hard.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A handcuffed inmate whose fatal beating by correctional officers last year sparked outrage died by homicide, according to findings of an autopsy report a lawyer for the man's family shared Wednesday.",
      "The report attributed Robert Brooks\u2019 death on Dec. 10 to compression of the neck and multiple blunt force injuries, attorney Elizabeth Mazur told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe autopsy report confirms what was already clear,\u201d the family\u2019s defense team said in a statement. \u201cRobert Brooks\u2019s violent death was a homicide. We look forward to the prosecution of those responsible. In the meantime, we are pushing forward with our fight for justice for Mr. Brooks and his family.\u201d",
      "A homicide finding does not imply wrongdoing. It means the person died at the hands of another.",
      "A spokesperson for the Onondaga County Health Department said it could not release the findings because the case remains under active investigation. The local prosecutor\u2019s office also declined to comment, citing a pending investigation.",
      "In a statement, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul cited the findings and said authorities should now move quickly to file criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThose responsible for Mr. Brooks\u2019 death must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis reprehensible act of violence demands the full force of our justice system \u2014 the family of Mr. Brooks deserves no further delays.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The union previously described the officers' conduct, which was captured on video, as \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cnot reflective of the great work that the vast majority of our membership conducts every day.\u201d",
      "Brooks, 43, was serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault when he was transferred to Marcy Correctional Facility in Oneida County, roughly 240 miles north of New York City, on Dec. 9, New York Attorney General Letitia James told reporters after his death.",
      "Officers involved in the confrontation had not activated their body cameras, so they did not capture audio and recorded only 30 minutes of video while the devices were in standby mode, James said. Her office released several videos from the four officers' cameras that captured the beating.",
      "One video shows Brooks \u2014 whose hands are cuffed behind his back \u2014 being carried upside down into a medical exam room at the facility. It remains unclear what words Brooks exchanged with the officers, and while Brooks does not appear to physically retaliate, the videos present different angles, and at times it is unclear what is happening in the room.",
      "Another video shows officers repeatedly striking Brooks while his hands are still restrained. At one point, one of the officers can be seen lifting Brooks by his neck and slamming him onto a bed in the room.",
      "In December, Hochul ordered the state Department of Corrections to begin the process of firing 14 corrections officers, sergeants and a nurse at Marcy. Officials have publicly identified all 14, and they have been suspended without pay, except for one officer who had already resigned. The status of the remaining officers was not immediately clear Wednesday.",
      "Daniel Martuscello, commissioner of the Corrections Department, said in December that his office had launched an investigation in an effort to bring \u201cinstitutional change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no excuse and no rationalization for a vulgar, inhumane act that senselessly took a life,\" he said. \"This type of behavior cannot be normalized, and I will not allow it to be within DOCCS.\u201d",
      "In a civil complaint filed in federal district court in New York last month, Brooks' estate accused 17 people of excessive force and made other allegations in connection with his death. The suit does not specify damages. No lawyers are listed for the defendants, and they have not responded to the suit."

      "Three men who are alleged to be part of a theft group from South America were indicted Wednesday in the break-in at Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow\u2019s home, prosecutors in Ohio said.",
      "The three men, all from Chile, were arrested on state charges in Ohio late last month in connection with the break-in, which was discovered at the home in Hamilton County on Dec. 9.",
      "Burrow was in Texas at the time, leading the Bengals to a 27-20 win over the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "Jordan Francisco Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, 23; and Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, 38; were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury. They are charged federally with transporting stolen goods interstate and falsifying records in a federal investigation.",
      "\u201cOur investigation remains ongoing as these individuals seem to be the alleged tip of the iceberg of South American Theft Groups committing crimes throughout our district and elsewhere,\u201d Kenneth L. Parker, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement.",
      "An FBI affidavit filed with a criminal complaint Monday says investigators found photos in Cabello's phone showing items stolen in the burglary and of the three men posing together with another man.",
      "Burrow\u2019s name is not spelled out in court documents, but the victim is referred to as \"J.B., an NFL player for the Cincinnati Bengals.\" Using initials in a criminal complaint is not unusual.",
      "The date and time the break-in was discovered as laid out in the indictment matches a Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office incident report that does name Burrow \u2014 and Burrow himself acknowledged that his home was broken into and said he felt violated, including by the information that was out in the public.",
      "\"So, obviously everybody has heard what has happened. I feel like my privacy has been violated in more ways than one,\" Burrow said Dec. 11, two days after the break-in. \"And way more is out than I would want out there and that I care to share.\"",
      "The burglary was reported at around 8:14 p.m. on Dec. 9, by an associate of the homeowner who saw disarray and a broken window, the federal prosecutor's office said.",
      "More than $300,000 in luggage, glasses, wristwatches and jewelry was stolen, an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit as part of a criminal complaint against the three men filed Monday.",
      "A trail camera caught a single person carrying luggage near the home, and nearby license plate readers led to the identification of a suspicious vehicle, a 2024 Volkswagen Atlas SUV, which was later found abandoned in Florida, the FBI agent wrote.",
      "The person who leased that SUV led the FBI to the eventual discovery that Cabello leased it using a fake ID, and then investigators identified Morales from a photo of the pair in the vehicle, the affidavit says.",
      "Cellphone data led to a motel in Fairborn, Ohio, on Jan. 10, and all three men now federally charged were pulled over by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, according to the FBI affidavit.",
      "A fourth man was also arrested and faces state charges. All of them were in the country without authorization, having either entered the county illegally or overstayed their visas, the FBI agent wrote.",
      "Federal online court records did not show attorneys for any of the three men federally charged Wednesday evening.",
      "Two men alleged to be linked to the burglary crew accused in the break-in of Burrow's home were charged this week in New York with acting as \"fences.\" A \u201cfencing\u201d operation involves the buying and selling of stolen goods.",
      "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn charged Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar with conspiracy to receive stolen property.",
      "Nezhinskiy is alleged to have had contact with at least two members of the group that broke into the home in Ohio on Dec. 9, the U.S. attorney's office said.",
      "Nezhinskiy and Villar pleaded not guilty in federal court in Brooklyn on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. attorney's office said that Nezhinskiy and Villar operated a pawn shop in Manhattan and that investigators found a large number of stolen items there, as well as more stolen items at storage units in New Jersey.",
      "Prosecutor Michael Maffei\u00a0said at the men's arraignment Wednesday that the scheme involved transferring the stolen goods out of the country or selling them.",

      "Nezhinskiy's attorney, Todd Greenberg, told reporters outside court that he was happy that the judge set bond, although they still have to secure liens and Nezhinskiy was not expected to be released Wednesday.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the beginning of the case, as you know,\" Greenberg said. \"We\u2019re looking forward to seeing the evidence, and we\u2019re going to take it from there and look forward to fighting the case.\""

    "story": [
      "BRUNSWICK, Ga. \u2014 A judge Wednesday ended the trial of former Georgia prosecutor accused of using her influence to protect the men who chased and killed\u00a0Ahmaud Arbery\u00a0by throwing out the felony indictment used to charge her, abruptly halting the weeklong case before it went to the jury.",
      "Former District Attorney\u00a0Jackie Johnson\u00a0has long denied influencing police who initially decided against making arrests when Arbery was fatally shot nearly five years ago in coastal Glynn County, where Johnson then served as the top state prosecutor. The judge\u2019s ruling closed the book on criminal charges that hung over Johnson for more than three years.",
      "Johnson faced charges of violating her oath of office, a felony, and a misdemeanor count of obstructing police when her trial opened last week. It ended in her favor Wednesday morning without a verdict from the jury that heard five days of testimony from\u00a0witnesses, including Johnson.",
      "Senior Judge John R. Turner dismissed the oath violation charge after Johnson\u2019s attorneys argued the 2021 indictment was fatally flawed by technical errors and ultimately failed to accuse her of any crimes.",
      "\u201cFrankly, this is a decision I didn\u2019t want to make,\u201d Turner said in court. But he said the defense\u2019s challenge to the indictment \u201cneeds to be granted.\u201d",
      "Turner on Monday\u00a0ordered Johnson acquitted\u00a0of the misdemeanor obstruction charge. He ruled after prosecutors rested their case, declaring they failed to show \u201cone scintilla of evidence\u201d that Johnson had directed police investigators not to arrest the man who shot Arbery.",
      "Arbery\u2019s parents\u00a0said they still believe Johnson tried to protect the men who killed their son. His father, Marcus Arbery Sr., called the judge\u2019s decision to end the trial \u201cdevastating.\u201d His mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, said she believed the jury would have convicted Johnson.",
      "\u201cThe evidence was there,\u201d Cooper-Jones told reporters. \u201cWe all know that Jackie Johnson played a part in the cover-up of the death of Ahmaud.\u201d",
      "Father and son Greg and Travis McMichael armed themselves with guns and used a pickup truck to chase Arbery after spotting the 25-year-old Black man running in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. A neighbor, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range with a shotgun.",
      "More than two months passed without arrests. Then the video of the shooting leaked online, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. All three men were later charged and\u00a0convicted of murder\u00a0and federal\u00a0hate crimes\u00a0in separate trials.",
      "Georgia Attorney Chris Carr ordered an investigation of Johnson that resulted in her 2021 indictment. Prosecutors for Carr\u2019s office accused Johnson of withholding information that a neighboring district attorney appointed by Carr to the case had already advised police that Arbery was shot in self-defense.",
      "Greg McMichael had worked for Johnson as an investigator and retired the previous year. He left a voicemail for Johnson asking for help.",
      "Johnson denied wrongdoing on the witness stand, saying she never told anyone to spare the McMichaels. George Barnhill, the first of three outside prosecutors assigned to handle Arbery\u2019s case, testified he concluded the shooting was justified without Johnson\u2019s input.",
      "\u201cAhmaud Arbery was slaughtered for no reason, and then Attorney General Carr piggybacked on the greatest tragedy \u2026 and indicted an innocent woman,\u201d said Brian Steel, Johnson\u2019s lead defense attorney. He added: \u201cJackie was painted as a person who supported racism. That\u2019s just totally false.\u201d",
      "Johnson was voted out of office in November 2020 and largely blamed her defeat on controversy over Arbery\u2019s killing. She left the courthouse without speaking to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Prosecutors struggled to build a case. Their own witnesses called to testify about how district attorneys handle conflicts of interest told the jury they didn\u2019t see that Johnson had acted illegally. The indictment accused Johnson of directing two police officers not to arrest Travis McMichael. One of them, Stephanie Oliver, testified that never happened. The second officer was never called as a witness.",
      "In a statement, Carr said his office had worked to do \u201ceverything possible to ensure justice was served.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe stand by the case we presented,\u201d Carr said, \u201cand we regret that the jury won\u2019t get to decide.\u201d",
      "Defense attorneys for Johnson asked the judge to dismiss the indictment last week. Turner deferred ruling until Wednesday morning. He didn\u2019t explain his reasoning.",
      "Johnson\u2019s attorneys argued the oath violation charge cited an expired oath Johnson had taken in 2010. At the time she was indicted, they said, Johnson had taken a new oath after winning reelection in 2016.",
      "Defense lawyers also said the indictment accused Johnson of actions that weren\u2019t oath violations. It said she had shown \u201cfavor and affection\u201d to Greg McMichael, failed to treat Arbery\u2019s family with \u201cfairness and dignity,\u201d and didn\u2019t disclose to Carr\u2019s office that she had enlisted Barnhill\u2019s help before he was officially appointed.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t set forth a crime,\u201d Steel said. \u201cIt said that Jackie did not show dignity to the Ahmaud Arbery family because she told the attorney general some things. All of that is lawful.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Trump administration evicted former Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan from her home with three hours of notice on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's administration evicted former Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan from her home with three hours of notice on Tuesday \u2014 not even enough time to gather her personal effects \u2014 according to two people familiar with the incident.",
      "Fagan, a four-star admiral and the first woman to lead a branch of the military, was removed from her post as the Coast Guard\u2019s top officer on Trump\u2019s second day in office. Officials at the Homeland Security Department \u2014 which oversees the Coast Guard \u2014 cited border security issues and an \u201cexcessive focus\u201d on diversity, equity and inclusion among the reasons for her dismissal.",
      "Fagan, who was named commandant in 2022, made a convenient target for a new president who wanted to flex his muscle. The process for firing her was less complex than for dismissing chiefs of the four main branches of the military. More than that, the move allowed him to send signals about his anti-DEI agenda and desire to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and goods into the United States.",
      "Throwing her out of her house on short notice went a step further.",
      "\"It's petty and it's personal,\" one Fagan ally said.",
      "But a DHS official countered that it made sense for her to be moved out of the home at Joint Base Anacostia Bolling.",
      "\"She was terminated with cause two weeks ago today and she was still living in those admiral quarters,\" the official said, confirming that Fagan had been told to leave. The official said they could not confirm or deny the three-hour timeline.",
      "NBC News reached out to the White House and the Coast Guard for comment.",
      "Coast Guard leaders had given Fagan a 60-day waiver to find new housing, according to one of the sources. But on Tuesday, Homeland Security officials told the acting commandant, Kevin Lunday, that he had to kick her out because \"the president wants her out of quarters,\" according to one of the people familiar with the incident.",
      "The DHS official was not able to immediately ascertain whether the directive had in fact come from Trump or whether his name had been invoked without his knowledge.",
      "Lunday then informed Fagan, at 2 p.m. Tuesday, that she had three hours to get out. Shortly after that, her team received a call from aides to Sean Plankey, a DHS senior adviser and retired Coast Guard officer, instructing her to leave the house unlocked so that the interior could be photographed, according to one of the sources.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really strange power play,\u201d the Fagan ally said.",
      "Fagan pushed back on DHS officials taking pictures of the inside of the home.",
      "\"I do not authorize them to come into my house, whether I'm there or not,\" she told another Coast Guard official. Lunday relayed that back to Plankey's team, noting that an attempt to access the house would amount to trespassing, according to one of the sources. But Fagan did depart.",
      "She left the house \u201cwith many \u2014 maybe all \u2014 of her personal items and household goods still there,\u201d said a former U.S. military official. She spent the night with friends.",
      "United States Transportation Command is now responsible for moving her personal effects out of the house.",
      "\"She was given a different place to stay,\" the DHS official said. \"We\u2019re still providing her housing.\"",
      "The official was not able to say what form of housing, and the Fagan ally said that an alternative was not offered to her as part of the discussion of her vacating the premises."

    "title": "Trump signs executive order banning trans women from women's sports",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:16:02 GMT",
    "summary": "The president signed three orders restricting transgender rights, including limits on military service and access to gender-affirming care.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing in female sports. The measure, called the \u201cNo Men in Women\u2019s Sports Executive Order,\u201d is the fourth executive order targeting transgender people he has signed since he took office Jan. 20.",
      "\u201cThe radical left has waged an all-out campaign to erase the very concept of biological sex and replace it with a militant transgender ideology,\u201d Trump said from a podium at the White House, with dozens of women and girls standing behind him. \u201cWith this executive order, the war on women\u2019s sports is over.\u201d",
      "Trump also gave multiple examples of what he described as \u201cmen claiming to be girls\u201d and \u201cstealing\u201d victories, at one point perpetuating the false claim that Algerian female boxer Imane Khelif, who faced intense scrutiny over her gender at the Paris Olympics in August, was assigned male at birth.",
      "In a call with reporters Wednesday morning ahead of the signing, White House officials said that they expect headlines about the executive order to use the word \"transgender\" but that \"this has nothing to do with that.\" The order, they said, aims to protect women's access to safe and fair athletic opportunities, and it will do that in two ways, they said.",
      "First, officials said, the administration will roll back the Biden administration's guidance on Title IX, a civil rights law that prevents sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities that receive federal funding.\u00a0Under that guidance, schools were required to allow trans students to access school sports teams and sex-segregated facilities that align with their gender identities. Trump's order will, instead, bar students assigned male at birth from participating in girls' and women's sports and using women's restrooms. The Education Department will be tasked with investigating potential violations, and the administration \u201cwill be asking for investigations,\" the officials said.",
      "Second, officials said, the administration will work with sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee, to ensure the guidance is followed in noneducational settings. The guidance, they added, will affect U.S. visa policies.",
      "\"If you are coming into the country and you are claiming that you are a woman but you are a male here to compete against women, we\u2019re going to be reviewing that for fraud,\" one of the officials said.",
      "The timing of the \u201cNo Men in Women\u2019s Sports Executive Order\u201d does not appear to be coincidental: Wednesday is the 39th annual National Girls & Women in Sports Day, which was started in 1987 as a way to celebrate female athletes and inspire girls to participate in sports.",
      "The issue of transgender women participating in women\u2019s sports was a consistent and divisive topic leading up to the November elections. On the campaign trail \u2014\u00a0and even after he won the election \u2014\u00a0Trump referred to trans women as men and pledged to \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "A Gallup survey of U.S. adults conducted in May 2023 found that nearly 70% of respondents said trans athletes should be allowed to compete only on sports teams that correspond with their birth sexes, up from 62% in 2021. Twenty-seven states already have laws, regulations or policies banning transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identities, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank.",

      "Former Harvard University swimmer Schuyler Bailar, who made history in 2015 as the first openly transgender athlete to compete on a Division I men\u2019s team, called the order \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis, I think, is a really horrible way to invite a lot of discrimination \u2014 not just against trans people \u2014 but also against all people in the women\u2019s category, because this is a policing of women\u2019s bodies in sports.\u201d said Bailar, 28.",
      "Riley Gaines, a former college swimmer who has become an outspoken opponent of trans women in women's sports, applauded the trans sports ban on social media Tuesday and attended the signing ceremony Wednesday.",
      "Gaines wrote on X: \u201cThings could\u2019ve been so different. Gender insanity was the final straw that brought a lot of moderates to the side of common sense. Specifically, I believe it was the issue of men in women\u2019s sports. I\u2019ve been living in a state of gratitude everyday since Nov 5th. Praise God.\u201d",
      "A number of LGBTQ rights organizations criticized the order after Trump signed it Wednesday. Carl Charles, a senior attorney for Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy organization, said the order \"takes aim at K-12 and college athletes \u2014 a vanishingly small subset of people who on the whole, outside of a few sensationalized examples, have been participating in school sports programs for decades with absolutely no issues.\"",
      "\"We are appalled, and in fact disgusted, at this administration\u2019s insatiable appetite for fearmongering about and relentless targeting of this most vulnerable population,\" Charles said. He added that multiple states that have enacted restrictions on trans athletes' participation have faced lawsuits.",
      "Courts have blocked state bans in Arizona, Idaho, Utah and West Virginia. New Hampshire\u2019s restriction has been blocked against the two trans plaintiffs who sued, and Montana\u2019s law has been permanently blocked from taking effect in colleges but not K-12 schools, according to the Movement Advancement Project.",
      "Before Wednesday\u2019s trans sports order, Trump signed three others that directly target transgender people. On Inauguration Day, he signed an order proclaiming that the government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and that \u201cthese sexes are not changeable.\u201d He also signed orders barring transgender people from serving openly in the military and restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans people younger than 19 nationwide."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic lawmakers are staging protests outside federal agencies, holding resistance-themed news conferences back home and taking to social media as they try to combat President Donald Trump\u2019s moves to remake the government with executive power.",
      "Relegated to the minority in Congress and left with few legislative tools to check Trump, Democrats are seeking to rally voters against his push to freeze federal loans and grants, dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development and other agencies and allow his government efficiency czar, billionaire Elon Musk, to access Americans\u2019 federal data.",
      "On Monday, congressional Democrats staged a protest outside USAID. On Tuesday, they appeared outside the Treasury Department. On Wednesday, they spoke to a crowd near the Capitol and another outside the Labor Department. It all comes as Democrats seek to find their voice and break through in a cluttered media environment while Trump overwhelms the national discourse with one disruptive action after another.",
      "\u201cThis is not America First \u2014 this is America in retreat,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said at the Capitol rally. \u201cAnd we are not going to retreat from American values.\u201d",
      "Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., who represents more than 70,000 federal workers in his district next to Washington, said the protests will help mobilize support and sway public opinion.",
      "\u201cPeople need to know how serious this is,\u201d Beyer told NBC News. \u201cYou tear down the federal government, you also tear down our whole society. If you eliminate one of the three branches of government, you can\u2019t run a country.\u201d",
      "He was one of a dozen Democratic lawmakers who tried to enter the Washington headquarters of USAID on Monday, then gathered outside to protest Trump and Musk\u2019s shuttering of the decades-old agency, which is responsible for delivering $40 billion in food and other humanitarian aid overseas.",
      "At some of the protests and online, Democrats have been jeered by anti-Trump demonstrators who believe the party is failing to rise to the moment. \"Do you job! Do your job!\" protesters chanted at lawmakers at one point at the Capitol rally.",
      "\u201cI hear people are frustrated. And when people are asking us to do more, I think we\u2019re going to do more,\u201d said Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, 35, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \u201cAfter the election, a lot of Democrats needed some time to soul search and breathe. And now that time is over. The richest billionaire in the world can now take all of our taxpayer money and data and is getting richer off of it. So it\u2019s time for us to get off the mat and get back into the ring.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight smarter than last time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also need to fight harder.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, Elon Musk has got to go,\u201d outside the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees executive branch employees. Later, a group of lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Reps. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M.; Veronica Escobar, D-Texas; and Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., protested on the steps of the Treasury Department with scores of activists and supporters.",
      "\u201cWhen we open up the Senate every single morning, we don\u2019t pledge allegiance to the billionaires. We don\u2019t pledge allegiance to Elon Musk. We don\u2019t pledge allegiance to the creepy 22-year-olds working for Elon Musk. We pledge allegiance to the United States of America,\u201d a fired-up Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told the crowd at the Treasury Department.",
      "\u201cWe have to reach out to everyone in this country \u2014 conservatives, liberals, Republicans, Democrats \u2014 and tell them that we have not months, we have not weeks, but we have days to stop the destruction of our democracy,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Democrats use limited tools at their disposal",
      "Senate Democrats have a greater check on Trump and his party than their House counterparts. They can use the 60-vote threshold to filibuster GOP legislation and significantly delay Trump\u2019s executive branch and judicial nominees.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, has threatened to put a blanket hold on all of Trump\u2019s State Department nominees, while others have said Democrats should stall all of his picks.",
      "And the party is making a unified stand against some remaining Trump nominees, like Russell Vought for budget director, voting en masse against proceeding to his nomination Wednesday and beginning what they promised would be a 30-hour session that keeps the Senate in all night.",
      "House Democrats are at a greater disadvantage, and not all think the public protests around Washington are effective in stopping Trump.",
      "Progressive Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said that Democrats need better, bolder tactics and that he specifically wants to see the party unify behind a message that it will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless Trump backs off his unilateral spending cuts.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t pass a debt ceiling increase without the Democrats. Every single Democratic House and Senate member should say on the record that we will not vote for a debt ceiling increase unless we have an ironclad commitment from President Trump and the Office of Budget and Management to spend every single dollar that Congress appropriates,\u201d Khanna said in an interview.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s pretty simple, and that is Congress asserting our power,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the Democrats not just shouting into the wind but actually asserting with strength our demands for the Constitution.\u201d",
      "Democrats are also eying a key March 14 deadline for Congress to fund the government or shut it down as a mechanism to pressure Trump to spend the money that the legislative branch has directed him to. Party leaders say there is no value to striking a new spending deal if Trump can ignore the part of it that he does not like.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you could ever get a budget again in the United States Congress, under anyone, if we don\u2019t start setting up rules that the law is a law,\u201d Casar said. \u201cHow do parties negotiate a law if the president doesn\u2019t have to do it? How could one ever sit down and negotiate anything ever again?\u201d",
      "Grappling with a moving target",
      "Since Trump returned to the White House two weeks ago, Democrats have been grappling with the question of how aggressively to take him on as the party\u2019s progressive base demands action. The debate unfolded behind closed doors Wednesday at House Democrats\u2019 weekly caucus meeting.",
      "Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., the head of Democrats\u2019 messaging operation, told rank-and-file members that when Trump makes news, her team will rapidly send out talking points to make sure the issues \u201cresonate\u201d back home in their districts, said a source in the room.",
      "\u201cWe are just 15 days into the Trump presidency, but it is obvious that there are two words that sum up what Republicans are doing: chaos and corruption,\u201d Dingell told her colleagues, according to the source. \u201cThe news cycle is moving so quickly that we don\u2019t have time to respond to everything that happens. As Leader Jeffries has made clear, we must be targeted and effective.\u201d (Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is the House minority leader.)",
      "\u201cWhen Trump blunders \u2014 whether it\u2019s with the funding freeze, with tariffs or with the next big thing, eliminating the Department of Education \u2014 we must be ready to pounce and make Republicans pay,\u201d Dingell said, adding that Democrats held nearly 80 events in their districts in response to Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cLet me tell you something else: This nationwide drumbeat works.\u201d",
      "Jeffries has dubbed Trump\u2019s push to unilaterally cut or freeze spending the \u201cRepublican rip-off.\u201d But inside Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a member of the progressive \u201csquad,\u201d stood up and asked what that broad phrase means, the source said.",
      "In a letter to colleagues last week, Jeffries explained the \u201crip off\u201d as Republicans\u2019 \u201cstealing taxpayer dollars, grants and financial assistance as part of their corrupt scheme to pay off billionaire donors and wealthy corporations.\u201d",
      "Jeffries and other Democrats have said their party needs to take the fight against Trump to the \u201cstreets.\u201d Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., said at the rally outside the Capitol on Wednesday: \u201cWe must resist. We must be in the streets.\u201d",
      "Bipartisan members of the House Jan. 6 committee had accused Trump of inciting violence when he told thousands of his supporters to go to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell\u201d as he sought to block the certification of the 2020 election results. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sought to turn the tables, accusing Democrats of inciting violence even though all of the protests have been peaceful.",
      "\u201cFor Democratic officials to incite violence and encourage Americans to take to the streets is incredibly alarming, and they should be held accountable for that rhetoric,\u201d she said."

      "President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been attending the swearing-in ceremonies for his Cabinet officials in the last two weeks, having Vice President JD Vance and others take part in the ceremonial moments \u2014 until Wednesday, when Attorney General Pam Bondi took her oath of office.",
      "It was a notable shift as he welcomed the new attorney general, whose confirmation process revolved mostly around whether Bondi \u2014 a Florida Republican and former member of Trump\u2019s personal legal team \u2014 would make decisions independently from the White House.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time those questions came up when a president tapped a personal lawyer or ally to the Department of Justice.",
      "The clearest precedent for choosing personal lawyers for top jobs at the Department of Justice is William French Smith, who was President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general after serving as his estate lawyer. Perhaps no president and attorney general came into office with a stronger personal bond than when President John F. Kennedy nominated his 35-year-old brother, Robert F. Kennedy, for the post. And President Richard Nixon and John Mitchell were law firm colleagues before Mitchell ran Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign, served as attorney general and then resigned to run Nixon\u2019s infamous 1972 campaign.",
      "Now it\u2019s Bondi, a former Florida state attorney general who represented Trump in his first impeachment trial and was involved in the legal team that sought to overturn the 2020 election. Trump also named Todd Blanche, his lead defense lawyer in the New York hush money case, who also worked on Trump\u2019s other federal criminal cases in 2023 and 2024, to be Bondi\u2019s deputy. Blanche\u2019s co-counsel, Emil Bove, was named principal associate deputy attorney general and has been acting deputy attorney general while Blanche awaits confirmation. John Sauer, who successfully argued Trump\u2019s presidential immunity case before the Supreme Court, has been tapped to serve as solicitor general, where he would argue cases before the high court.",
      "\"I think she's going to be as impartial as you can possibly be,\" Trump said of Bondi on Wednesday. \"I know I'm supposed to say she's going to be totally impartial with respect to Democrats, and I think she will be as impartial as a person can be. I'm not sure if there's a possibility of totally, but she's going to be as total as you can get.\"",
      "Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served under President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, said whether Trump\u2019s nominees have the \u201ccourage and fortitude to say no to the president\u201d will determine where the Justice Department goes from here.",
      "Gonzales, the only person ever to serve both as White House counsel and attorney general, says that having a personal relationship to the president \u201ccan be a big benefit\u201d \u2014 as long as one has the ability to stand up to the president when necessary.",
      "\u201cThe concern about being close to the president arises when he asks you to do something that is contrary to the interest of justice, such as whether to begin or discontinue an investigation or prosecution \u2026 then you have to have the backbone to recommend against doing something against your better judgement and explain to the president why you are recommending a course of action,\u201d Gonzales, now the dean of Belmont University School of Law, told NBC News. \u201cAnd if he continues to press you, then you have to decide whether to agree to do what the president wants against your better judgment, or decide to simply resign.\u201d",
      "Relationships and impartiality",
      "NBC News spoke to several legal experts who were concerned that this group of nominees won\u2019t have that \u201cbackbone\u201d that Gonzales says they need.",
      "Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama and as President Joe Biden\u2019s personal lawyer, worries Trump thinks he has \u201cgotten around norms and ethics of the DOJ by picking \u2018my guys.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cTheir relationship to him is entirely that of personal lawyers, lawyers in private practice who represented him, up to the inauguration, represented him on matters that are personal to him and critically important to him, and now are being put in the Department of Justice,\u201d Bauer said, where the client won\u2019t be Donald Trump but the United States government.",
      "While Trump isn\u2019t the first president to name personal lawyers to top jobs at the Justice Department, the nature of their representation does make them unique.",
      "Blanche and Bove, in particular, defended Trump \u201cin criminal cases brought by the incumbent party,\u201d said John Yoo, who served as deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush\u2019s administration. It gives their nominations \u201ca much more combative, partisan flavor,\u201d said Yoo, who said that\u2019s partly Biden\u2019s fault.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference, I think, between just advising someone who wins the presidency on their will and trusts, versus, fighting in the criminal courtroom against the United States government itself, and the DAs in New York and Georgia,\u201d Yoo said.",
      "When Smith was nominated to serve under Reagan in 1981, senators pressed him on whether their relationship would affect his impartiality. Smith committed to adhering to a firm recusal policy.",
      "\u201cI would have to be very conscious of situations where it could appear that because of that relationship, a problem might be created,\u201d Smith said at the time. \u201cCertainly, if a situation arises involving the president or a member of his family or others in a sensitive situation, I would recuse myself from participating or handling any aspect which might develop out of that situation.\u201d",
      "Jed Shugerman, a professor of law at Boston University who has studied the history of cronyism in American politics, said that it was particularly \u201ctransgressive\u201d to appoint one\u2019s brother as attorney general, as John F. Kennedy did in 1961. Ultimately, he noted that Robert F. Kennedy made important achievements for federal civil rights.",
      "And Mitchell\u2019s close relationship with Nixon ended up playing a role in both of their downfalls in the Watergate scandal. Mitchell associates testified that he supervised the financing of the Nixon campaign\u2019s \u201cdirty tricks,\u201d including the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters that broke open the scandal. Mitchell went to prison, and Nixon resigned the presidency.",
      "Leading the Justice Department",
      "Gonzales sees Bondi as well qualified to be attorney general by virtue of experience, but told NBC News that he could not vouch for her willingness to keep the White House out of decisions relating to investigations and prosecutions if requested by the president. He emphasized that one of the most important jobs for the attorney general is defending the work and the men and women at the Department of Justice \u2014 and efforts to clear out people who worked on Jan. 6 Capitol riot cases or investigations of Trump were already underway as Bondi went through her confirmation.",
      "Gonzales was disappointed to hear Bondi tell senators at her confirmation hearing that the \u201cdepartment has been weaponized for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it is wrong. I think it is harmful,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cI think it\u2019s harmful for career folks to hear that they have weaponized, they have politicized the Department of Justice. In an agency with over 100,000 employees some people will make mistakes or do something wrong or questionable from time to time, but to condemn an entire department is wrong.\u201d",
      "Bauer said that \u201cloyalty, as defined by commitment to the president\u2019s governing program, is perfectly appropriate,\u201d but \u201cabsolute loyalty of a very personal kind is different.\u201d",
      "Yoo said that \u201cgiven everything we know about Trump,\u201d he would be \u201cutterly shocked if he didn\u2019t pick everyone who was loyal to him for every job.\u201d He added that Trump might be \u201covercorrecting\u201d from his first transition in 2017, when he \u201cpicked people he didn\u2019t know and had no relationship with.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation upended President Trump\u2019s relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in March 2017, leaving then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to put Mueller in charge of that probe.",
      "Later that year, during an interview with The New York Times, Trump said, \u201cSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News in 2019 that choosing Sessions was the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of his first term.",
      "\u201cThere were several professionals under Jeff Sessions who continued on in their roles in the DOJ and that\u2019s part of why we had the Mueller investigation,\u201d Shugerman said."

      "The selection of Joe Kent as director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is part of a wider effort by the administration to place trusted loyalists and partisan activists in senior government positions in intelligence, law enforcement and diplomacy. Trump and his supporters have said the intelligence community sought to undermine the president in the past and needs a radical overhaul.",
      "The National Counterterrorism Center oversees U.S. government intelligence on terrorist threats and retains a database of all known and suspected terrorists. Kent served in Army Special Forces, undertaking 11 combat deployments during a 20-year career, and later worked at the CIA.

      "Ellis will arrive at the CIA just as employees weigh a so-called \u201cbuyout\u201d offer from the new administration. The CIA informed its workforce on Tuesday that employees can receive eight months pay and benefits if they agree to resign. Similar options have been offered to workers at other federal agencies and departments, prompting criticism from lawmakers and labor unions that the move could strip the federal government of expertise \u2014 particularly in the field of law enforcement and national security.",
      "Ellis was an aide to Devin Nunes, the former Republican congressman who served as chair of the House Intelligence Committee during the outset of Trump\u2019s first term. Nunes was a steadfast defender of Trump when lawmakers were investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian operatives.",

Col. Alexander Vindman, then an official on the National Security Council.

      "At the end of Trump\u2019s first term, in November 2020, Ellis was\u00a0named\u00a0general counsel of the National Security Agency. The NSA\u2019s director at the time, Paul Nakasone, opposed the move. In the final days of Trump\u2019s term, the acting defense secretary, Christopher Miller, ordered the NSA to install Ellis in the general counsel job. But as soon as the Biden administration took over, Ellis was placed on administrative leave by Nakasone, pending an inspector general inquiry into his appointment.",
      "The inspector general\u2019s office\u00a0concluded\u00a0that there had been no untoward influence in the appointment.\u00a0But it also found that Nakasone acted properly in placing Ellis on administrative leave. Ellis resigned from the NSA in April 2021"

      "The list used the first names and the first initials of the last names of those hired in the past two years, the current U.S. official said. The names are of employees who are still on probation. The CIA\u2019s probationary periods can extend for years.",
      "\u201cAny foreign intelligence service worth its weight could apply research and analytic tools to marry up these names and initials with other public records to identify and target many of them,\u201d a former senior intelligence official said.",
      "The emailed list was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, said the email endangered intelligence officers.",
      "\u201cExposing the identities of officials who do extremely sensitive work would put a direct target on their backs for China. A disastrous national security development,\u201d Warner said on social media.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC that the unclassified email had created an avoidable security risk. \u201cAn absolutely unnecessary counterintelligence risk was assumed today,\u201d Himes said.",

      "The email comes against the backdrop of a push by the Trump administration to drastically scale back the federal workforce, offering so-called \u201cbuyouts\u201d to employees to resign and receive eight months in pay. The CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence sent similar \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d offers to its employees this week, and similar offers are expected to be extended across all 18 intelligence agencies, officials said."

      "The Trump administration has taken aim at USAID, a taxpayer-funded agency that delivers billions of dollars in humanitarian aid to other countries but has attracted attention from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, which has accused it of wasteful spending. USAID has placed almost all direct hires on administrative leave following the reforms under the Trump administration. The agency\u2019s website has gone dark, and the administration temporarily frozen foreign aid.",
      "Replicating USAID's impact would most likely prove difficult, Gates said.",

      "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte was impeached Wednesday on a range of accusations that include plotting to assassinate the president, large-scale corruption and failing to strongly denounce China\u2019s aggressive actions against Filipino forces in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The move by legislators in the House of Representatives, many of them allies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., deepens a bitter political rift between the two highest leaders of one of Asia\u2019s most rambunctious democracies.",
      "Marcos has strengthened defense ties with his country\u2019s treaty ally, the United States, while the vice president\u2019s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, nurtured cozy relations with China and Russia during his stormy term that ended in 2022.",
      "Sara Duterte did not immediately comment on her impeachment, but her brother, Rep. Paolo Duterte, said it was \u201ca clear act of political persecution.\u201d Rival lawmakers maneuvered to quickly collect signatures and push a \u201cbaseless impeachment case\u201d to the Senate, he said.",
      "Duterte has repeatedly accused Marcos, his wife and his cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, of corruption, weak leadership and attempting to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028 after Marcos\u2019s six-year term ends.",
      "At least 215 legislators in the lower house signed the complaint, significantly more than the required number to rapidly send the petition to the Senate, which would serve as a tribunal to try the vice president, House of Representatives Secretary-General Reginald Velasco told a plenary House meeting in the body\u2019s last session before a four-month recess.",
      "Among the signatories of the impeachment complaint was the president\u2019s son, Rep. Sandro Marcos, and Romualdez. The petition urged the Senate to shift itself into an impeachment court to try the vice president, \u201crender a judgement of conviction,\u201d remove her from office and ban her from holding public office.",
      "\u201cDuterte\u2019s conduct throughout her tenure clearly displays gross faithlessness against public trust and a tyrannical abuse of power that, taken together, showcases her gross unfitness to hold public office and her infidelity to the laws and the 1987 Constitution,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "Duterte ran alongside Marcos in 2022 on a campaign battle cry of unity in a deeply divided Southeast Asian country. Both were scions of strongmen accused of human rights violations, but their strong regional bases of support combined to give them landslide victories.",
      "Marcos is the son and namesake of the late dictator ousted in a 1986 pro-democracy uprising. The vice president\u2019s father and Marcos\u2019s predecessor, Duterte, led a deadly anti-drug crackdown that is being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "The whirlwind political alliance of the campaign rapidly frayed when they took office.",
      "The impeachment complaint against the vice president focused on a death threat she made against the president, his wife and the House speaker last year, irregularities in the use of her office\u2019s intelligence funds and her failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "She said in an online news conference on Nov. 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn\u2019t a joke.",
      "She later said that she wasn\u2019t threatening him, but was expressing concern for her own safety. However, her statements set off an investigation and national security concerns.",
      "Allegations of graft and corruption against her also emanated from a monthslong and televised House investigation on the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos ($10.5 million) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte\u2019s offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post after her political differences with Marcos deepened.",
      "She has also been accused of unexplained wealth and failure to declare her wealth as required by the law. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings last year.",
      "The impeachment complaint accused Duterte of undermining the Marcos government\u2019s policies, including her description of the administration\u2019s handling of territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea as a \u201cfiasco.\u201d The complaint also mentioned her silence over China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.",
      "\u201cHer sheer evasiveness and silence on the West Philippine Sea issue, an issue that strikes at the core of Philippine sovereignty, is diametrically opposed to her being so loquacious as to other issues,\u201d the impeachment petition said, using the Philippine name for the disputed waters."

      "The Trump administration filed a motion Wednesday night seeking to enter a proposed order that detailed the agreed-upon terms.",
      "\"The Defendants will not provide access to any payment record or payment system of records maintained by or within the Bureau of the Fiscal Service,\" the proposed order says.",
      "The order would allow exceptions for two special government employees at the Treasury \u2014 Tom Krause and Marko Elez \u2014 saying they are permitted access \"as needed\" to perform their duties, \"provided that such access to payment records will be 'read only.'\"",
      "The restricted access would remain in effect pending a subsequent hearing on the lawsuit. The judge still needs to sign off on the proposed order.",
      "The White House and the groups that filed the lawsuit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The suit contends newly minted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent should not have given DOGE access to the secure system. Bessent \"decided behind closed doors to allow\u00a0individuals not involved in the processing of the government\u2019s financial transactions to root around in the Bureau\u2019s records. Giving access to those records is unlawful,\" their filing said.",
      "\"And the longer that the private information of Plaintiffs\u2019 members remains accessible to unauthorized third parties, the greater the irreparable injury is. After all, as long as the sensitive data of Plaintiffs\u2019 members remains accessible to Mr. Musk and other members of DOGE, the more opportunity there is for that data to be disclosed to still more unauthorized third parties, either accidentally or deliberately,\" they added.",
      "The lawsuit sought a temporary restraining order barring Treasury from \"disclosing information about individuals\" to DOGE and directing the agency \"to retrieve and safeguard any such information that has already been obtained by DOGE or individuals associated with it.\"",
      "At a hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a Justice Department lawyer denied that Treasury was sharing Americans' personal information.",
      "\u201cThe allegation that that information is being shared with third parties outside of Treasury is incorrect,\u201d said the attorney, Bradley Humphreys.\u00a0He said that two DOGE appointees classified as special government employees, the same status held by Musk, have been granted access to the systems but that there is no plan for those two employees or any other DOGE employee working at the Treasury Department to share the information with Musk or anyone outside of Treasury.",
      "DOGE's actions under Musk \u2014 a tech billionaire and key ally of President Donald Trump \u2014 have prompted fierce criticism from Democrats, who have painted Musk as an unelected bureaucrat who is amassing outsized power and reshaping the federal government without the necessary checks and balances.",
      "\"Let\u2019s not mince words here: An unelected, unaccountable billionaire with expansive conflicts of interest, deep ties to China and an indiscreet ax to grind against perceived enemies is hijacking our nation\u2019s most sensitive financial data system and its checkbook,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a floor speech Wednesday.",
      "Musk, who spearheads DOGE, has defended it as \"something that is sorely needed,\" framing his efforts as cutting down on wasteful spending.",
      "\"DOGE is the wood chipper for bureaucracy,\" he said Monday on X.",
      "Musk is working in the Trump administration as a \"special government employee,\" according to a White House official, meaning he is not a full-time federal worker. That categorization also suggests Musk's employment period in the White House is limited to about a third of a year.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Trump renamed the U.S. Digital Service as the Department of Government Efficiency. He had previously announced that Musk would help lead the advisory group.",
      "Musk has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development for elimination, prompting the administration to grind humanitarian assistance to a near-halt. He has also turned his attention toward the other wings of the federal government, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that DOGE would have a role in his department, as well, saying on X that the entity is \"going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.\""

      "Three men who are alleged to be part of a theft group from South America were indicted Wednesday in the break-in at Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow\u2019s home, prosecutors in Ohio said.",
      "The three men, all from Chile, were arrested on state charges in Ohio late last month in connection with the break-in, which was discovered at the home in Hamilton County on Dec. 9.",
      "Burrow was in Texas at the time, leading the Bengals to a 27-20 win over the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "Jordan Francisco Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, 23; and Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, 38; were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury. They are charged federally with transporting stolen goods interstate and falsifying records in a federal investigation.",
      "\u201cOur investigation remains ongoing as these individuals seem to be the alleged tip of the iceberg of South American Theft Groups committing crimes throughout our district and elsewhere,\u201d Kenneth L. Parker, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement.",
      "An FBI affidavit filed with a criminal complaint Monday says investigators found photos in Cabello's phone showing items stolen in the burglary and of the three men posing together with another man.",
      "Burrow\u2019s name is not spelled out in court documents, but the victim is referred to as \"J.B., an NFL player for the Cincinnati Bengals.\" Using initials in a criminal complaint is not unusual.",
      "The date and time the break-in was discovered as laid out in the indictment matches a Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office incident report that does name Burrow \u2014 and Burrow himself acknowledged that his home was broken into and said he felt violated, including by the information that was out in the public.",
      "\"So, obviously everybody has heard what has happened. I feel like my privacy has been violated in more ways than one,\" Burrow said Dec. 11, two days after the break-in. \"And way more is out than I would want out there and that I care to share.\"",
      "The burglary was reported at around 8:14 p.m. on Dec. 9, by an associate of the homeowner who saw disarray and a broken window, the federal prosecutor's office said.",
      "More than $300,000 in luggage, glasses, wristwatches and jewelry was stolen, an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit as part of a criminal complaint against the three men filed Monday.",
      "A trail camera caught a single person carrying luggage near the home, and nearby license plate readers led to the identification of a suspicious vehicle, a 2024 Volkswagen Atlas SUV, which was later found abandoned in Florida, the FBI agent wrote.",
      "The person who leased that SUV led the FBI to the eventual discovery that Cabello leased it using a fake ID, and then investigators identified Morales from a photo of the pair in the vehicle, the affidavit says.",
      "Cellphone data led to a motel in Fairborn, Ohio, on Jan. 10, and all three men now federally charged were pulled over by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, according to the FBI affidavit.",
      "A fourth man was also arrested and faces state charges. All of them were in the country without authorization, having either entered the county illegally or overstayed their visas, the FBI agent wrote.",
      "Federal online court records did not show attorneys for any of the three men federally charged Wednesday evening.",
      "Two men alleged to be linked to the burglary crew accused in the break-in of Burrow's home were charged this week in New York with acting as \"fences.\" A \u201cfencing\u201d operation involves the buying and selling of stolen goods.",
      "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn charged Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar with conspiracy to receive stolen property.",
      "Nezhinskiy is alleged to have had contact with at least two members of the group that broke into the home in Ohio on Dec. 9, the U.S. attorney's office said.",
      "Nezhinskiy and Villar pleaded not guilty in federal court in Brooklyn on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. attorney's office said that Nezhinskiy and Villar operated a pawn shop in Manhattan and that investigators found a large number of stolen items there, as well as more stolen items at storage units in New Jersey.",
      "Prosecutor Michael Maffei\u00a0said at the men's arraignment Wednesday that the scheme involved transferring the stolen goods out of the country or selling them.",
      "Maffei estimated the value of the stolen goods found in the storage units at $1.5 million, with a potential to be valued at $5 million when all is tallied.",
      "Nezhinskiy's attorney, Todd Greenberg, told reporters outside court that he was happy that the judge set bond, although they still have to secure liens and Nezhinskiy was not expected to be released Wednesday.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the beginning of the case, as you know,\" Greenberg said. \"We\u2019re looking forward to seeing the evidence, and we\u2019re going to take it from there and look forward to fighting the case.\""

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:05:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Abject fear among agents that they could lose their jobs has distracted and destabilized the FBI workforce, current and former federal law enforcement officials say.",
    "story": [
      "First-of-their-kind lawsuits, near-daily staff memos from the little-known acting FBI director and abject fear among agents that they could lose their jobs have distracted and destabilized the FBI workforce, a half-dozen current and former federal law enforcement officials with experience in the bureau told NBC News.",
      "The tensions at the country's most powerful federal law enforcement agency follow a Trump administration request for the names of thousands of agents assigned to work on Capitol riot-related investigations. Assurances from the administration that it will review agents\u2019 conduct and not necessarily fire them have not quelled fears of mass firings.",
      "If the new administration fires or punishes agents involved in the Jan. 6 investigations \u2014 referred to within the bureau as simply \u201c1-6\" \u2014 it could affect the FBI in three dangerous ways, the current and former law enforcement officials said.",
      "National security risk",
      "Many of the agents involved in the investigations of the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, work in the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, which operates Joint Terrorism Task Forces in cities across the country with federal and local law enforcement agencies. Those agents investigate terrorism threats both from inside the United States and from overseas groups, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Most of the Joint Terrorism Task Forces in the United States are primarily made up of FBI agents, say the officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss dynamics in the bureau. And most of the terrorism cases are brought by the FBI, according to court documents and public filings.",
      "So the potential removal of thousands of those agents \u2014 some estimate the number of counterterrorism agents could be over 4,000 \u2014 poses a major threat to the FBI\u2019s ability to combat terrorist threats, the current and former officials say.",
      "The agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases were assigned to do so by superiors or by court orders in many instances, the officials noted. Agents and other FBI staff members do not pick their assignments.",
      "Punishing thousands of Jan. 6 case agents could also damage FBI operations not related to terrorism, the current and former officials say. Agents from smaller FBI field offices, for example, were also brought in to work on Jan. 6 cases. Dismissing those agents could affect smaller FBI field offices that investigate misconduct by local law enforcement agencies, corporations and public officials.",
      "Public corruption risk",
      "Retaliation against agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations could also have a chilling effect on FBI agents' desire to investigate future cases involving the second Trump administration.",
      "The current and former officials say they wonder whether FBI officials would be willing to investigate, for example, a person in Trump\u2019s personal orbit. A past example would Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign manager, who was investigated by FBI agents and convicted of tax and bank fraud.",
      "An investigation into a Manafort-like figure would dismay agents and potentially prompt some to refuse to investigate him, citing fear of reprisal, current and former officials say. Agents might also wonder about the consequences of investigating prominent Democratic figures, should they retake the White House.",
      "Democratic leaders have not called for the firing of FBI agents involved in the investigations of former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., or Hunter Biden, for example. But FBI personnel are concerned that the payback pendulum could swing both ways, the officials say.",
      "A former FBI official who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation, predicted that the current probe of Jan. 6 agents will have a lasting impact. \u201cThe chilling effect \u2014 it has a long tail,\u201d the former official said. \u201cYou\u2019re putting everyone on notice. They\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re watching you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Retention and recruitment risks",
      "Firing agents would also be likely to damage efforts to retain veteran agents and recruit new ones, the current and former officials say.",
      "Agents fired for their work on Jan. 6 cases would be unable to get hired by other federal law enforcement agencies, the officials say. If they managed to get hired by local police departments, it would most likely be for less pay and lower retirement benefits.",
      "The economic impact on agents\u2019 families would be immediate, the officials say. Since agents frequently work long hours and spend extensive time away from home, they are often their families\u2019 sole breadwinners.",
      "What surprises agents is that many genuinely believed that a new administration would bring positive change, the current and former officials say. Many agents hoped a new FBI director would bring much-needed changes to the structure and management of the FBI.",
      "They hoped more agents would be sent into the field from headquarters in Washington, the officials say. And they hoped that new technology would be adopted, which many officials told NBC News is sorely needed.",
      "An unlikely leader",
      "As rumors of mass layoffs have shaken the workforce in ways not seen in decades, an unexpected leader has emerged. Staffers have lauded acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll Jr., a career agent and the head of the FBI\u2019s field office in Newark, New Jersey, for standing up to Trump appointees and pushing back against orders for agents to be fired.\u00a0Current and former agents said Driscoll resisted the efforts so forcefully at times that they feared he might be forced out himself.",
      "On Tuesday, Driscoll released a video touting the FBI's recent accomplishments, including recent arrests of two people on the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted Fugitives list and agents' roles in investigating the plane crashes over Washington, D.C., and in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cWe will never take our eyes off of our mission, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cBecause at the bureau we\u2019re focused on the work, the people we do the work with, our partners and the people we do the work for, the American people.\u201d",
      "Agents credit Driscoll with stopping mass firings, for now, current and former officials say. They also know that the Trump administration could remove him at any time."

      "\u201cWe were married. When it was great, it was spectacular. When it was bad, it was horrific. There wasn\u2019t a lot of in between. We went full throttle, or you hit the emergency brake,\u201d she said.",

      "\"Just in the first glance of seeing Lamar, I feel a little bit of \u2014 God, this is so familiar and so unchartered all at the same time. I don't know this person anymore. I don't know. It's really just a mindf--k. I don't know how else to explain it,\" she said in her confessional.",

      "\"I have dealt with so much trauma in this relationship for years, and this was such the love of my life that that to learn how to un-love someone, to have to go through all that \u2014 it's almost like a death,\" she said.",

      "\u201cI can see Lamar is having such a hard time speaking. And I understand. We have been through so much. Maybe I remind him of a time in his life that\u2019s a really dark time. I don\u2019t know. But right now it\u2019s just uncomfortable memories and feelings,\u201d Kardashian said in a confessional.",

      "\"Thank you.\"",
      "\"That love \u2014 I don't think it will ever go away. I know it wont.\"",
      "Kardashian, after he said that, looked into the corner. The conversation will continue in the next episode."

The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It\u2019s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable,\" he said.",

      "What do the tarot readers predict about Chiefs v. Eagles?",
      "We spoke to four tarot readers who pulled cards related to the game.",
      "The results were somewhat mixed, with two tarot readers convinced of the Eagles' victory, one believing the Chiefs will win and another saying the Chiefs will face will face \"strong competition\" and obstacles in their quest to win their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Blue June predicts the Eagles will win in a well-matched challenge. says. \"I pulled the Nine of Wands for the Eagles victory which means from start to finish the Chiefs put up a great fight and the game is especially intense during the first quarter as I\u2019ve pulled the Emperor card. The Nine of Pentacles warns the Eagles to move with caution and discipline, but they will surely persevere,\u201d she says.",
      "Theresa Reed, aka the Tarot Lady, forecasts the Chiefs will win. For the overall game, she pulled the Page of Swords, which she says means \"the game will be down to the wire,\" and \"a last-minute surprise move changes the game in an exciting way.\" She predicts one person will have an \"incredibly strong night.\"",
      "Sarah Potter predicted the Eagles would win after pulling the Seven of Wands, which she said symbolizes standing your ground and facing challenges. \"This could indicate that the Chiefs might need to defend their title and face strong competition,\" she says. Next, she pulled the Eight of Wands reversed. \"This card suggests delays or obstacles which implies that there are issues or setbacks that the team may need to overcome before achieving a win,\u201d she says.",
      "Fernando Salinas said things aren't looking good for the Chiefs. \"I pulled the Nine of Swords \u2014 definitely not a good omen. This is the card of anxiety, of worry, and of doubt,\" he says. Meanwhile, he pulled The Chariot for the Philadelphia Eagles. \"The Chariot is the card of victory, success, and ambition, and so a much better sign that the winning plays might be made by the Eagles this year,\" he says.",
      "What do the astrologers predict about Chiefs v. Eagles?",
      "Four astrologers made their predictions about the 2025 Super Bowl, studying how cosmic events will intersect with players' charts, plus the teams' overall charts.",
      "Catherine Urban calls this a \"very difficult call\" but concludes that the underdog Eagles will \"surprise fans with a better performance.\" She points to the moon in Cancer conjunct, or next to, Mars, currently retrograde in Cancer. Two of the quarterbacks \u2014 Hurts and Carson Wentz, alternate QB of the Chiefs \u2014\u00a0have Mars in Cancer, meaning this transit will affect them and be a significant moment.",
      "Lauren Ash predicts a \"nail-biter\" going back and forth until the end, ultimately resulting in a Chiefs victory. \"Energy drainer for all players \u2014 a total slog. Emotions will dominate the game. You will not have an idea of who is going to win this game until the end,\u201d Ash says.",
      "Renee Watt says the Eagles will benefit most from current planetary placements: \u201cWith the Cancer moon crossing over the team\u2019s natal Pluto, a surge of empowerment and emotional investment can give them the edge they need to score a win. With the sun and Mercury close to their North Node, an ability to think ahead will make it easier to anticipate the moves of their opponents. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the Chiefs won\u2019t put up a fight!\u201d",
      "Meghan Rose said Jupiter makes the case for either team winning.  Ultimately she thinks the Eagles will be the major upset winners.",
      "Finally, in my opinion, the Eagles will have extra luck due to the natal Jupiter in the birth chart for the team being aligned with the South Node of Destiny.",
      "In total, that amounts to six predictions for an Eagles victory and two for the Chiefs.",
      "We'll have to watch the game on Feb. 9 to find out."

      "In the three decades since the song's release, Seal says he feels \"really fortunate\" that it still resonates with people.",
      "\"I'm a kid from a working-class area of London born in the '60s with nothing but a lot of dreams and a voice,\" he says. \"And so, if you'd have told me I would have one song, just one song that would make such a difference and turn out to be an iconic song that most people around the world know, well ... it's amazing.

      "\"I love his work, and I love him as a person,\" he says. \"I think he's even more impressive as a person. So, I got to work with him, that was fun.\u00a0And he really took care of me, which is a big thing. It was just a professional cast.\"",
      "Seal's enjoyment on set wasn't the only thing he liked about doing the ad. He hopes his kids, whom he said on TODAY Feb. 5 have been sending him a meme of the ad to try and \"humiliate\" him, find pride in his performance.",
      "\u201cThey've seen a few runs of it,\u201d Seal tells TODAY.com. \u201cObviously not the final edit, but they\u2019ve seen it, and, you know, they make fun of me, they laugh but I think inside they\u2019re really proud.\u201d"

    "summary": "What is the story and controversy behind Bianca Censori's Grammys dress? Did she break the law? Why are people worried?",
    "story": [
      "Bianca Censori caused a stir at the Grammys this year when she appeared on the red carpet wearing a barely-there dress.",
      "The Australian architectural designer and model, 30, arrived at the ceremony with her partner, the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.",
      "Ye was nominated alongside\u00a0Ty Dolla $Ign, Rich The Kid, and Playboi Carti in the Best Rap Song category for \u201cCarnival.\u201d The last time Ye attended the Grammys was in 2015.",
      "\u201cNude\" dresses are nothing new on the red carpet, but Censori\u2019s provocative look seemed to go a step further than other past revealing outfits at major awards events.",
      "Her barely perceptible garment went viral and also raised questions on social media about indecent exposure laws.",
      "Read on to learn more about what Censori wore to the Grammys and whether she could face possible legal ramifications tied to their red carpet appearance.",
      "What did Bianca Censori wear to the Grammys, and why did it spark concern?",
      "Censori arrived at the Grammys on Feb. 2 wearing a long black coat. She coordinated with her partner, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who also wore an all-black ensemble.",
      "As they posed for photographers, Censori slipped off the jacket and revealed a skintight, fully see-through dress.",
      "Ye shared a photo of the dress on Instagram on Feb. 4 with the caption, \u201cTHE INVISIBLE DRESS.\u201d",
      "The dress provoked major discussion and backlash on social media, raising questions about the nature of Ye and Censori's relationship and if the outfit \u2014\u00a0which was designed by his brand, Yeezy \u2014 was her choice.",
      "Psychologist Channa Bromley told TODAY.com in an email clothing is a \"a form of self-expression, autonomy, and identity.\"",
      "Bromley suggests Censori's Grammys is a \"case study\" into a partner potentially exerting undue influence over another's choice of clothes. If the choice of outfit were Censori's, Bromley says it would be \"marked by confidence, ease and ownership of the moment.\" If it wasn't, Bromley says you might see \"micro-expressions of discomfort, hesitation, forced compliance.\"",
      "\u201cIn controlling relationships, dress codes can serve as both a test of submission and a display of ownership. The more extreme the shift, the more likely it\u2019s a symptom of something deeper than just evolving style,\u201d Bromley says.",
      "Bromley says the video of her disrobing may strike viewers as \"unsettling\" because of the \"psychology behind it.\"",
      "\"The lack of natural confidence, the robotic compliance, the vacant expression, it doesn\u2019t read as a woman fully in charge of her choices,\" she says.",
      "Psychologist Kelsey Latimer says that changing clothing style in a relationship isn't necessarily a red flag. \"Are you making choices because you want to? Has your style simply changed and you like trying something new?\" she asks. But \"making changes in one\u2019s attire out of fear of what will happen if you don\u2019t\" or \"worry that your partner will get jealous that others might admire you\" are signs of an unhealthy relationship.",
      "Latimer says she's not surprised the outfit provoked such a response and questions into Censori's well-being. \"For most of us, wearing something that is extremely exposing would create a sense of vulnerability so if the person themselves is not making that choice then that can lead to a sense of physical or emotional vulnerability and lack of internal safety,\" she says.",
      "The message a nude dress sends",
      "Revealing looks are nothing new on the red carpet; other stars, including Chrissy Teigen, Shakira and Victoria Mon\u00e9t, sported dresses with sheer or cutout elements at the Grammys this year.",
      "Stars in general have been pushing the envelope for decades with daring looks and in one sense, Censori\u2019s latest look is just the continuation of that trend, fashion historian and professor Deirdre Clemente told TODAY.com in an email.",
      "\u201cCensori\u2019s nude dress is the culmination of more than a century of 'barely there' eveningwear,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, her dress is as shocking in its extremeness, as the dresses of the 1920s were 100 years ago.\u201d",
      "However, even today\u2019s \u201cnude\u201d looks generally contain some degree of coverage, however scant, whereas Censori\u2019s dress gave her the appearance of being fully naked.",
      "In this sense, Censori\u2019s dress differs from the risqu\u00e9 looks of other famously provocative style icons.",
      "\u201cWhy Censori\u2019s dress is different from previous incarnations of Marilyn Monroe or Kim Kardasian, is that it breaks a fundamental rule of fashion. And it does that on purpose,\u201d Clemente said.",
      "\u201cFor millennia, fashion has been used to simultaneously \u2018hide\u2019 and \u2018flaunt\u2019 the female form. It is in that tension that fashion exists,\u201d she continued. \u201cCensori\u2019s dress takes away the tension between \u2018wondering\u201d and \u2018knowing\u2019 that has defined evening wear for centuries.\u201d",
      "Will Censori face any legal consequences for her look?",
      "Following the Grammys, some wondered online whether Censori had broken any laws with her daring outfit.",
      "\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Bianca Censori being arrested for indecent exposure?\u201d one person wrote on X.",
      "\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t consent to seeing you naked\u2026.That is called INDECENT EXPOSURE and it is a CRIME,\u201d another person commented. \u201cI never consented to seeing this woman naked and I\u2019m sure a lot of people with their children watching didn\u2019t either. This is really disturbing.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to TODAY.com that \u201can investigation has not been opened\u201d into Censori\u2019s Grammys look.",
      "In this situation, a criminal charge is very unlikely, Dmitry Gorin, a criminal defense attorney with the Los Angeles law firm Eisner Gorin LLP, told TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSomebody would have to report the offense to the police, and I just see Los Angeles police having plenty of other work than investigating indecent exposure,\u201d he said.",
      "Besides, even if someone did decide to bring charges, Gorin says Censori\u2019s nude look does not meet the elements of Penal Code 314, the California statute that prohibits indecent exposure.",
      "The code states that to be considered \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d an act \u201cmust be done in a manner that the defendant had intent to draw public attention to their genitals for sexual gratification or to offend another person.\u201d",
      "Gorin argues that in Censori\u2019s case, context matters. He argues she was appearing at the Grammys in the capacity of a model, meaning that it would be expected that she would display her body in some way.",
      "\u201cI think in this situation, she\u2019s a model, she knew she\u2019d be getting a lot of attention,\u201d Gorin said. \u201cIf she was ever charged, her lawyer would say, \u2018Look, this is just a model showing off her body.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also noted that because she was appearing as a model and public figure, there was likely a secondary \u201ccommercial\u201d motivation for her red carpet appearance, and that it was unlikely she was driven solely by an intent to \u201csexually gratify\u201d or \u201coffend.\u201d",
      "Gorin also points out that the Grammys are known as a place where people try out daring looks on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a place to show off, to wear dresses and clothes that strike media and public attention,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented announcement that he was planning to seize control of the Gaza Strip and oust 2.2 million Palestinians, temporarily at least, has provoked shock and disbelief around the world, with some officials and analysts saying it would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing.",
      "Many wonder whether it\u2019s even practically possible, instead suggesting it might be more a diplomatic gambit or a distraction technique rather than an actual policy plan.",
      "Regardless of its intention or viability, the alleged plan to transform the war-ravaged Palestinian enclave on Israel\u2019s western flank into the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d has been condemned outside of far-right circles in Israel and the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is the most foolish idea any American president has put forth in the modern history of the United States,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, a veteran Middle East expert and professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt is beyond any kind of rational thinking, any kind of policy feasibility.\u201d",
      "The announcement prompted dismay among senior officials and diplomats at a private event in Washington on Tuesday evening. Multiple sources noticed two prominent Arab ambassadors leaving immediately when Trump made his comments, which people were listening to on their phones in real time.",
      "Other diplomats reached later by NBC News from Europe and Asian capitals said there was widespread shock over the suggestion of removing the 2.2 million Palestinians in order to rebuild Gaza.",
      "Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally and U.S. foreign policy maven, questioned the proposal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what the Arab world says but you know that\u2019d be problematic at many many levels,\u201d he said.",
      "Within hours, vital U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan unequivocally, if diplomatically, rejected the idea of removing Palestinians from their lands.",
      "\u201cThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates its firm rejection of any infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,\u201d the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cThis includes opposition to Israeli settlement policies, the annexation of Palestinian lands, and efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their homeland.\u201d",
      "The immediate and sometimes angry reaction to the proposal is an indication of how in Gaza, Trump has alighted on a strip of land as emotionally charged and politically intractable as it is tiny and ruined. Most governments in the world recognize it as part of a future Palestinian state. And though the United States does not, it has been involved in six decades of peacemaking efforts in support of a two-state solution to the conflict."

    "title": "Trump is talking tougher toward Putin but has yet to ratchet up assistance to Ukraine",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The bromance between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has noticeably fizzled in the new term, although assistance to Ukraine has not yet been ratcheted up.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The bromance between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has noticeably fizzled in the new term, though Trump has yet to reveal the extent to which he\u2019ll pressure Russia to end its grinding war with Ukraine.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has dropped talk of Putin\u2019s strategic \"genius\" and \u201csavvy.\u201d In a conspicuous rhetorical shift, Trump has instead been warning that the Russian president he once called \"very smart\" is leading his country to ruin by prolonging the war.",
      "\u201cHe [Putin] should make a deal,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on his first day back in the White House. \u201cI think he\u2019s destroying Russia by not making a deal.\u00a0I think Russia is going to be in big trouble.\u201d",
      "The rationale behind the frostier tone is simple enough. Trump promised during the campaign to end the fighting within 24 hours of taking office, if not sooner. That deadline has passed, meaning the clock is ticking on Trump\u2019s vow to stop a costly, destructive war that began nearly three years ago when Russia invaded its democratic neighbor.",
      "Trump needs both Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to come to the table and negotiate a peace deal, which for Russia means abandoning any hope of swallowing up Ukraine in its entirety.",
      "Ukraine is prepared to bargain, Trump told the World Economic Forum three days after his inauguration. And Russia?",
      "\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to ask Russia,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHaving listened to Trump talk about Putin for almost a decade now, this is the most critical stuff he\u2019s ever said,\u201d Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, said in an interview.",
      "The Russian embassy did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Ways to pressure Putin",
      "Words alone won\u2019t compel Putin to give up the quest to subdue Ukraine, national security experts said. For that to happen, Trump will need to demonstrate to Putin that it\u2019s fruitless to continue fighting, they said.",
      "That will take some doing. Putin remains uninterested in peace talks as long as Russian troops continue to gain ground in Ukraine\u2019s east, albeit at a slow pace, and while Ukrainian forces hold seized territory in the Kursk region inside Russia, according to John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and other former officials.",
      "\u201cHe [Putin] doesn\u2019t want to negotiate now, because his troops are moving forward,\u201d Herbst said. \u201cHe wants to put more Ukrainian territory in his pocket when negotiations begin.\u201d",
      "Sergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, told NBC News in an interview that \u201cUkraine is open for negotiation, but it should be a negotiation. Not an ultimatum by Russia. In this case, Ukraine demonstrated a will to negotiate. Russia does not.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear how far Trump will go in confronting Russia over Ukraine and whether he would be ready to ratchet up military assistance \u2014 including long-range missiles \u2014 to Kyiv.",
      "Trump has at his disposal a variety of tools that might make Putin more inclined to stop fighting. The question is, will he use them?",
      "The Trump administration briefly delayed the shipment of weapons to Ukraine last week but it was unclear exactly why, according to\u00a0a source with knowledge of the matter.\u00a0The shipments have since resumed.",
      "Depriving Ukraine of weapons would be a severe blow to Kyiv\u2019s war effort against its much larger neighbor.",
      "Asked about the pause, the White House\u2019s National Security Council pointed to Trump\u2019s comments about Ukraine during an Oval Office appearance on Monday.",
      "There, Trump told reporters that he would be open to linking financial assistance to something the U.S. wants in return: Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey [the Ukrainians] have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it.\"",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the White House\u2019s National Security Council, said in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump shared yesterday, the United States needs to recoup any money it spends or has spent on Ukraine aid. The discussions over the weekend centered around how best to ensure that repayment, and a timetable has yet to be established.\u201d",
      "Split in the Trump administration",
      "Trump\u2019s advisers and Cabinet members are split over how much pressure to bring to bear, with national security adviser Mike Waltz and Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg wanting to use American leverage to prod Putin to stand down, according to former U.S. and Ukrainian officials and a source close to the Kyiv government.",
      "Others favor cutting back the billions of dollars in assistance the U.S. gave to Ukraine in the Biden administration as a way of forcing a swift end to the conflict. Critics of that approach say it would effectively disarm Ukraine and thus amount to a capitulation to Russia.",
      "Before becoming vice president, then-Sen. JD Vance was a fierce skeptic of the money the Biden administration gave Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhy are spending $130 billion on Ukraine when we can\u2019t even pay our own bills at home?\u201d Vance said in one speech. He also called Ukraine\u2019s government \u201cthe most corrupt\u201d in Europe and possibly the world.",
      "Kellogg told NBC News in a statement, \u201cThe president\u2019s national security team is in sync.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president will use, as necessary, all levers of American strength to enable a conclusion to the carnage of the past three years,\u201d Kellogg added.",
      "A spokesperson for Vance declined comment Tuesday on his position on U.S. aid to Ukraine.",
      "Trump has laid out a few ideas for assisting Ukraine while the war continues.",
      "In a social media post two days after his swearing-in, he warned that he would slap Russia with tariffs, sanctions and taxes on the sale of Russian goods to the U.S. and other countries if Putin didn\u2019t negotiate an end to the war.",
      "A problem with that approach is that U.S. trade with Russia has fallen sharply, making tariffs less of a cudgel. Last year, the U.S. imported about $2.9 billion worth of goods from Russia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By contrast, in 2021, before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the figure was nearly $30 billion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total red herring,\u201d a former Biden administration national security official said of Trump\u2019s tariff threat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve totally disconnected the U.S. economy from the Russian economy,\u201d the former official added, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. \u201cSo, our ability to hurt Russia with tariffs is marginal.\u201d",
      "Another option would be for Trump to use Russia\u2019s own frozen assets, as opposed to U.S. tax dollars, to continue replenishing Ukraine supplies and weaponry.",
      "William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said that the $300 billion in Russian reserves sitting in European and U.S. banks \u201cwould go a long way to provide weapons and financial support to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat Trump could do is pressure the Europeans to seize those reserves and put them into an account for the Ukrainians and allow the Ukrainians to use that money to buy weapons from the U.S. and continue to operate their government,\u201d Taylor said in an interview.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump knows that the Russian economy is fragile and vulnerable to further sanctions. And thus, he knows that he has leverage on Putin,\u201d he added.",
      "A fear among Ukraine\u2019s supporters was that Trump would abandon the country upon returning to office. The warmth he had shown Putin over the years suggested he might bring about a settlement favorable to Russia, they worried.",
      "During a debate between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris last year, Trump did not say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.",
      "But now that he\u2019s in office, some who\u2019d questioned Trump could be a fair broker have been heartened to see that, at least, his team isn\u2019t selling out Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI think he [Trump] has started to realize how hard resolving this issue is and that Russia is not going to be constructive unless we apply more pressure,\u201d a U.S. official involved in Ukraine and Russia policy said in an interview, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.",
      "\u201cOne reason Trump\u2019s rhetoric has evolved is the switch from campaign to governing mode. The obstacle to peace is not Ukraine. I think that\u2019s sort of dawning on him, and it\u2019s also dawning on him how bad it would be politically, if nothing else, and strategically, if this f----- up.\u201d"

      "A small girl in a pink sweater waved goodbye through the smudged window of a bus as it prepared to depart Gaza on Saturday, packed with 37 ill and injured patients, most of them children with cancer, in need of medical treatment that Gaza's war-ravaged hospitals cannot provide.",
      "It was the first time in nine months that medical evacuees have been able to leave Gaza by the Rafah border crossing, and outside Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, weary mothers held their sick and listless children wrapped up in coats, anxiously waving their documents at officials to confirm their place.",
      "But their departure was bittersweet \u2014 only a few patients made the list that day, and each could bring only one companion.",
      "A small boy who tried to squeeze his way onto the bus with his sick brother and mother was escorted off.",
      "\u201cThey did not allow me to pass,\u201d Khalil, 8, still sobbing from being separated from his family, told NBC News' crew. \u201cMy brother went with my mom; he is sick.\u201d",

      "The conflict has destroyed much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, causing its health system to collapse. Beyond the enormous needs of the skyrocketing number of war wounded, hundreds of thousands of people with acute and chronic illnesses were left with limited or no access to medicine and treatment.",
      "According to the WHO, from the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, to when the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, Gaza's health care system sustained more than 1,200 direct attacks, including at least 660 on health facilities, and over 1,000 attacks that affected health care workers.",

      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",
      "She felt newly hopeful in November 2020, when Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy was elected to a second consecutive term in a landslide. The military coup took place within three months, shattering Maung\u2019s dreams.",
      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",
      "\u201cSometimes, some people feel that this way is usual,\u201d Maung said, \u201cbut this is not normal.\u201d"

He said WHO guidelines at the time led to the largest shutdown \u201cin the history of mankind.\u201d",

    "summary": "Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte was impeached Wednesday on a range of accusations that include plotting to assassinate the president.",
    "story": [
      "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte was impeached Wednesday on a range of accusations that include plotting to assassinate the president, large-scale corruption and failing to strongly denounce China\u2019s aggressive actions against Filipino forces in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The move by legislators in the House of Representatives, many of them allies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., deepens a bitter political rift between the two highest leaders of one of Asia\u2019s most rambunctious democracies.",
      "Marcos has strengthened defense ties with his country\u2019s treaty ally, the United States, while the vice president\u2019s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, nurtured cozy relations with China and Russia during his stormy term that ended in 2022.",
      "Sara Duterte did not immediately comment on her impeachment, but her brother, Rep. Paolo Duterte, said it was \u201ca clear act of political persecution.\u201d Rival lawmakers maneuvered to quickly collect signatures and push a \u201cbaseless impeachment case\u201d to the Senate, he said.",
      "Duterte has repeatedly accused Marcos, his wife and his cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, of corruption, weak leadership and attempting to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028 after Marcos\u2019s six-year term ends.",
      "At least 215 legislators in the lower house signed the complaint, significantly more than the required number to rapidly send the petition to the Senate, which would serve as a tribunal to try the vice president, House of Representatives Secretary-General Reginald Velasco told a plenary House meeting in the body\u2019s last session before a four-month recess.",
      "Among the signatories of the impeachment complaint was the president\u2019s son, Rep. Sandro Marcos, and Romualdez. The petition urged the Senate to shift itself into an impeachment court to try the vice president, \u201crender a judgement of conviction,\u201d remove her from office and ban her from holding public office.",
      "\u201cDuterte\u2019s conduct throughout her tenure clearly displays gross faithlessness against public trust and a tyrannical abuse of power that, taken together, showcases her gross unfitness to hold public office and her infidelity to the laws and the 1987 Constitution,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "Duterte ran alongside Marcos in 2022 on a campaign battle cry of unity in a deeply divided Southeast Asian country. Both were scions of strongmen accused of human rights violations, but their strong regional bases of support combined to give them landslide victories.",
      "Marcos is the son and namesake of the late dictator ousted in a 1986 pro-democracy uprising. The vice president\u2019s father and Marcos\u2019s predecessor, Duterte, led a deadly anti-drug crackdown that is being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "The whirlwind political alliance of the campaign rapidly frayed when they took office.",
      "The impeachment complaint against the vice president focused on a death threat she made against the president, his wife and the House speaker last year, irregularities in the use of her office\u2019s intelligence funds and her failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "She said in an online news conference on Nov. 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn\u2019t a joke.",
      "She later said that she wasn\u2019t threatening him, but was expressing concern for her own safety. However, her statements set off an investigation and national security concerns.",
      "Allegations of graft and corruption against her also emanated from a monthslong and televised House investigation on the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos ($10.5 million) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte\u2019s offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post after her political differences with Marcos deepened.",
      "She has also been accused of unexplained wealth and failure to declare her wealth as required by the law. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings last year.",
      "The impeachment complaint accused Duterte of undermining the Marcos government\u2019s policies, including her description of the administration\u2019s handling of territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea as a \u201cfiasco.\u201d The complaint also mentioned her silence over China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.",
      "\u201cHer sheer evasiveness and silence on the West Philippine Sea issue, an issue that strikes at the core of Philippine sovereignty, is diametrically opposed to her being so loquacious as to other issues,\u201d the impeachment petition said, using the Philippine name for the disputed waters."

He was educated in the U.S., having studied comparative literature at Brown University, and has served on the boards of various agencies within the Aga Khan Development Network, the spiritual leader\u2019s main philanthropic organization, according to a statement it released Wednesday.",

      "The late Aga Khan was given the title of \u201cHis Highness\u201d by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather, the Aga Khan III, unexpectedly made him heir to the family\u2019s 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect.",
      "Over decades, the late Aga Khan evolved into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly with ease.",

      "A network of hospitals bearing the Aga Khan\u2019s name is scattered in places where health care was lacking for the poorest, including Bangladesh, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where he spent tens of millions of dollars in developing local economies.",
      "Ismailis lived for many generations in Iran, Syria and South Asia before also settling in east Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as Europe, North America and Australia more recently. They consider it a duty to donate up to 12.5% of their income to the Aga Khan as steward.",
      "Shenila Khoja-Moolji, an associate professor at Georgetown University who studies Muslim societies, said Ismailis turn to the Aga Khan in matters of faith and daily life, and followers believe in his \u201cdivinely inspired knowledge\u201d that allows him to interpret the Quran.",
      "Prince Rahim has three siblings, two brothers and one sister."

      "This year he took a slow train instead, paying 160 yuan ($22) to sit upright for 18 hours. For Huang, that was a far more affordable option than the high-speed train ($92) or even a bed on the slow train ($40).",
      "Though Huang makes more money in Beijing than he would back home, living expenses in the Chinese capital are high.",

      "Chinese travelers made a total of 501 million domestic trips during the eight-day holiday, an increase of 5.9% compared with last year, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism said Wednesday as the country returned to work. They spent 677 billion yuan ($93 million) on domestic tourism during the holiday, the ministry said, up 7% compared with last year.",
      "But as they enter the Year of the Snake, Chinese consumers appear to be feeling squeezed.",
      "Though China\u2019s consumption expenditure per capita grew more than 5% last year, to about 28,200 yuan ($3,900), consumer confidence is at all-time lows, affecting retail sales in sectors such as clothing and cosmetics. That could limit long-term gross domestic product growth as China adjusts to slower growth overall.",
      "Increasing consumption is considered vital for reducing China\u2019s reliance on exports, all the more so as U.S. tariffs and Chinese counter-tariffs stir fears of an all-out trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",

      "In an effort to encourage spending, Beijing has been pushing an expanded consumer trade-in scheme that offers subsidies for home appliances such as microwaves and rice cookers, as well as electronic items such as smartphones.",

      "Shopper Xu Zicong said he saved 1,500 yuan ($208) on his new iPhone 16, thanks to the subsidy combined with discounts from the retailer and Apple, whose China sales are slowing as it faces growing competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iran\u2019s government seems to be welcoming some recent decisions by the United States \u2014 even though they happen to come from a man Iranian operatives have allegedly been plotting to assassinate.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s moves to freeze spending on foreign aid and overhaul, maybe even end, the U.S. Agency for International Development have been lauded in Iranian state media.",
      "The reports say the decisions will halt funding for opponents of the country\u2019s Shiite theocracy \u2014 pro-democracy activists and others supported through programs as part of U.S. government efforts to help democracy worldwide.",
      "At the same time, Iranian officials appear to be signaling that they are waiting for a message from Trump on whether he wants to negotiate over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program. At stake are potentially billions of dollars withheld from Iran through crushing sanctions and the future of a program on the precipice of enriching weapons-grade uranium.",
      "And even when signing an executive order to reimpose his \u201cmaximum pressure on Iran\u201d on Tuesday, Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran.",
      "Meanwhile, ordinary Iranians worry what all this could mean for them. On Wednesday, Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, plunged to a record low of 850,000 to $1 after Trump\u2019s order, showing the ongoing economic volatility they face. A decade ago, it stood at 32,000 rials to $1.",
      "\u201cIt encourages hard-liners inside Iran to continue repressions because they feel the U.S. would have less capability in supporting Iranian people who seek freedom,\u201d said Maryam Faraji, a 27-year-old waitress in a coffee shop in northern Tehran.",
      "The state-run IRNA news agency said that \u201ccutting the budget of foreign-based opposition\u201d could \u201caffect the sphere of relations\u201d between Tehran and Washington.",
      "Newspapers, like the conservative Hamshhari daily, described Iran\u2019s opposition as \u201ccounterrevolutionaries\u201d who had been \u201ccelebrating\u201d Trump\u2019s election as heralding the \u201clast days of life of the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "They then \u201csuddenly faced the surprise of cut funding from their employer,\u201d the newspaper crowed.",
      "Even the reformist newspaper Hammihan compared it to a \u201ccold shower\u201d for opponents of Iran\u2019s theocracy abroad, an idea also expressed by the Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cThose financial resources are not charity donations,\u201d Esmail Bagahei, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. \u201cThey are wages paid in exchange for services.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a clear sign of America\u2019s interventionist policy particularly during the Biden administration, which tried to pressure Iran and meddle in its domestic affairs through financial aid,\u201d Bagahei added.",
      "It remains unclear how funding for Iranian activists and opposition figures would be affected by the USAID decision.",
      "Iran also noticed that the U.S. avoided direct criticism of the Islamic Republic during a review by the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva last week. For those in Iran\u2019s government, there\u2019s anticipation this could mean that Trump is willing to negotiate, something he repeatedly brought up in his election campaign as a possibility.",
      "Even Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in September opened the door to talks with the U.S., saying there is \u201cno harm\u201d in engaging with the \u201cenemy.\u201d More recently, he tempered that, warning that sinister plots could still be \u201cconcealed behind diplomatic smiles.\u201d",
      "While Bagahei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged Iran hasn\u2019t seen any \u201cgreen light\u201d yet for talks, Iran is trying to do everything it can to signal it wants them.",
      "The country\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on outreach to the West, urged officials on Monday to listen to dissent from the Iranian people and avoid further crackdowns like those that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cThe enemies are hoping that by stirring up disputes within the country, they will throw people into the streets and then ride the wave of protests themselves,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "As he signed the executive order on Iran on Tuesday, Trump warned the country would be \u201cobliterated\u201d if he was assassinated by Tehran. But he still left the door open for talks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to sign it, but hopefully we\u2019re not going to have to use it very much,\u201d he said from the Oval Office. \u201cWe will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.\u201d",
      "However, factions within Iran\u2019s theocracy are still likely to oppose talks, whether out of their own self-interest or over anger that Trump ordered the 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the country\u2019s top general and a revered figure.",
      "That killing fueled Iranian calls for Trump\u2019s assassination \u2014 and alleged plots against him. In November, the Justice Department disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump. While Iran denied being involved, Tehran has a history of plotting the killing of opponents abroad.",
      "\u201cThis will not have any impact on the factions that oppose talks with the U.S., but maybe some moderates find it as an excuse to say that Trump is taking some steps,\u201d Iranian political analyst Ahmad Zeiabadi said."

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 10:35:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Greenland\u2019s parliament passed a bill that bans political parties from receiving contributions \u201cfrom foreign or anonymous contributors\u201d after President Donald Trump expressed his wish that the United States take over the island from Denmark.",
    "story": [
      "NUUK, Greenland \u2014 Greenland\u2019s parliament passed a bill Tuesday that bans political parties from receiving contributions \u201cfrom foreign or anonymous contributors\u201d after President Donald Trump expressed his wish that the United States take over the vast and mineral-rich Arctic island that belongs to Denmark.",
      "The bill is aimed at protecting \u201cGreenland\u2019s political integrity\u201d and will take effect immediately, according to a translation of a parliamentary document in Danish outlining the measure.",
      "The bill \u201cmust be seen in light of the geopolitical interests in Greenland and the current situation where representatives of an allied great power have expressed interest in taking over and controlling Greenland,\u201d the document said.",
      "Before taking office for his second term on Jan. 20, Trump said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, calling it vital to U.S. national security. His oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited Greenland last month and told citizens: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat you well.\u201d",
      "Denmark is a longtime U.S. ally and a founding member of NATO, and its semiautonomous territory is home to a large U.S. military base.",
      "With a total area of 836,000 square miles, Greenland \u2014 population about 57,000 \u2014 is over one-fifth the size of the United States, according to the CIA World Factbook.",
      "A senior legal officer at Greenland\u2019s parliament, Kent Fridberg, told The Associated Press he did not know whether any foreign donors had contributed to Greenland\u2019s political parties and that the idea for the bill was \u201cbasically a preventative measure.\u201d",
      "Fridberg noted that some Russian politicians had voiced a similar interest \u2014 and that political parties in Greenland are generally funded by public means.",
      "The new measure also prohibits any single party from receiving domestic private contributions that exceed 200,000 Danish kroner (about $27,700) in total, or 20,000 kroner (about $2,770) from a single contributor."

      "During its\u00a0weekly meeting, the cabinet approved the reduction, from 40 hours currently, in an executive decree penned by Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz, who leads the hard-left party Sumar.",
      "\u201cThis proposal is about living better,\u00a0working less and being much more productive and more efficient economically,\u201d Diaz told reporters.",
      "The measure still needs to be approved in parliament, where the center-left government led by Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez lacks a clear majority and\u00a0depends on balancing the demands\u00a0of several smaller parties to pass legislation.",
      "Diaz, who is also deputy prime minister, made the plan to reduce\u00a0working hours by the end of 2025 central to her party\u2019s support for Sanchez\u2019s premiership.",
      "But the center-right Catalan separatist party Junts has already signaled resistance to the proposal, while the main lobby for employers, CEOE, has said it would raise Spanish firms\u2019 costs and make them less competitive.",
      "After months of talks between Diaz and unions and employers\u2019 representatives, negotiations with CEOE broke down in November after it insisted the shorter\u00a0week\u00a0should not be imposed by law but through collective bargaining to suit each company\u2019s needs.",
      "\u201cThe corporate world is in favor of dialogue, but not in favor of monologue,\u201d CEOE chief Antonio Garamendi said Tuesday.",
      "Diaz has also\u00a0clashed with Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo, whom she accused of \u201csiding with employers\u201d after he proposed delaying the change by a year to give small businesses time to adapt.",
      "Spain\u2019s central bank and former economy minister have both warned that higher labor costs could fuel inflation and curb job creation.",
      "After the cabinet decision, Cuerpo said companies could resist the change given\u00a0Spain\u2019s strong economic growth, declining inflation and an unemployment rate at a 16-year low."

      "OREBRO, Sweden \u2014 Sweden's worst mass shooting\u00a0left at least 11 people dead, including the gunman, and at least five seriously wounded at an adult education center west of Stockholm.",
      "The gunman\u2019s motive hadn\u2019t been determined by early Wednesday as\u00a0the Scandinavian nation\u00a0\u2014 where gun violence at schools is very rare \u2014 reeled from an attack with such bloodshed that police early on said it was difficult to count the number of dead among the carnage.",
      "Officials said Wednesday that three women and two men, all with gunshot wounds, underwent surgery at Orebro University Hospital. All were in serious but stable condition after being admitted to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Another woman was treated for minor injuries and was stable.",
      "Jonas Claesson, regional director of health and medical services, said that two of the gunshot victims were in intensive care Wednesday. All of the victims are over age 18, officials said. No other patients related to the shooting were admitted to Orebro University Hospital overnight.",
      "The school, called Campus Risbergska, offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults age 20 and older, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. The school is on the outskirts of Orebro, which is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Stockholm.",
      "Justice Minister Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer called the shooting \u201can event that shakes our entire society to its core.\u201d King Carl XVI Gustaf and\u00a0Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson\u00a0ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the Royal Palace and government buildings.",

      "The shooting started\u00a0Tuesday afternoon\u00a0after many students had gone home following a national exam. Students sheltered in nearby buildings, and other parts of the school were evacuated following the shooting.",
      "Authorities were working to identify the deceased. Police said that officers discovered the gunman dead at the school when they arrived. It was unclear how the gunman died.",
      "Roberto Eid Forest, head of the local police, said that the school\u2019s large premises meant it took a long time for officers to search the campus to ensure there were not any more victims. Police heard gunshots when they arrived and initially thought they were being fired upon, he said.",
      "Eid Forest said that six officers were treated for smoke inhalation. There wasn\u2019t a fire, he said, but authorities didn\u2019t immediately know what caused the smoke.",
      "Investigators will spend Wednesday seeking information from witnesses and checking any video footage of the attack. Police wouldn\u2019t say whether the shooter had multiple guns.",
      "There were no warnings beforehand, and police believe the perpetrator acted alone. Police haven\u2019t said if the man was a student at the school. They haven\u2019t released a\u00a0possible motive, but authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point.",
      "Police raided the suspect\u2019s home after Tuesday\u2019s shooting, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what they found. Police cautioned the public against spreading incorrect narratives on social media.",
      "\u201cToday, we have witnessed brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people,\u201d\u00a0the prime minister\u00a0told reporters in Stockholm late Tuesday. \u201cThis is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. Many questions remain unanswered, and I cannot provide those answers either.",
      "\u201cBut the time will come when we will know what happened, how it could occur, and what motives may have been behind it. Let us not speculate,\u201d he said.",
