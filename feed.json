      "In the last few years, the Grammy Awards have made a concerted effort to diversify its electorate",
      "NEW YORK -- In the last few years, the Grammy Awards have made a concerted effort to diversify its electorate. In 2024, the Recording Academy revealed significant changes to its evolving voting body, saying 66% of voters joined in the previous five years, a number of whom were women and people of color. This year, there's even more movement: For the first time ever, all Latin Grammy voting members were invited to join the Recording Academy as part of its 2025 new member class.",
      "The Latin Grammys are a licensee of the Grammys and follow a similar voting process. But while the Grammys focus on the U.S. market, the Latin Grammys have global considerations, according to Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud. The Recording Academy also has a number of members on the Latin Grammys board.",
      "The results are notable: There are 3,800 new Recording Academy members in 2025. Half \u2014 50% \u2014 are 39 and under, 58% are people of color and 35% identify as women.",
      "And in that group, there are approximately 2,900 new Grammy voting members. Nearly half, 49%, are 39 and under; 60% are people of color and 30% identify as women.",
      "Over the last few years, Latin music has been skyrocketing in popularity, routinely celebrated as one of the fastest growing streaming genres in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe addition of many Latin Recording Academy voting members underscores that music has no borders and that our mission to serve music people, regardless of where they are from, is stronger than ever,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., academy president and CEO, wrote in a statement. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for our members\u2019 passion and hard work to shine through in this year\u2019s nominations.\u201d",

      "Reform at the Record Academy dates back to the creation of a task force focused on inclusion and diversity after a previous CEO, Neil Portnow, made comments belittling women at the height of the #MeToo movement. In the past, the Grammys have been criticized over a lack of diversity \u2014 artists of color and women left out of top prizes; rap and contemporary R&B stars ignored.",
      "In 2024, Mason jr. told The Associated Press that the Recording Academy sought to increase its voting body by reaching out to different, underrepresented communities. \u201cLet\u2019s take the time to understand why those people aren\u2019t engaging with us, figure out how we can fix that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once we fixed it, then let\u2019s invite them or ask them if they would like to be a part of our organization. So, it was a multi-step process.\u201d",

      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A2O MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden. But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

Lee advocates for worldwide standards on user verification and mediation systems where victims could identify attackers without expensive legal battles.",
      "But Lee resists the media\u2019s focus on K-pop\u2019s problems. \u201cShould we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?\u201d he asked. \u201cMedia should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn\u2019t we talk more about the future?\u201d",
      "After more than three decades, Lee\u2019s definition remains straightforward: \u201cK-pop is a new language of communication that transcends barriers. These languages move around naturally \u2014 what you can\u2019t stop is culture.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",
      "The record is reminiscent of Halsey\u2019s 2021 concept album, \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have Love, I Want Power,\u201d where femininity and motherhood are juxtaposed with influence, respect and violence.",
      "There\u2019s a similar rawness to Welch\u2019s poetry, as she grapples with mortality and ambition. But, like life, it\u2019s also accompanied by the mundane. \u201cDownloading \u2018Revelations of Divine Love\u2019 on my phone/Trying to read but getting distracted/Trying to live but feeling so damaged,\u201d she sings on \u201cPerfume and Milk,\u201d one of the more austere songs on the album.",
      "As a concept, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is stellar. There\u2019s a sonic and thematic unity to the album and its Halloween release makes perfect sense.",

      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug center abruptly resigned Sunday amid concerns about his personal conduct",
      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug center abruptly resigned Sunday after federal officials began reviewing \u201cserious concerns about his personal conduct,\u201d according to a government spokesperson.",
      "Dr. George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of General Counsel were notified of the issues, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email. Tidmarsh then resigned Sunday morning.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,\u201d Hilliard said.",
      "The departure came the same day that a drugmaker connected to one of Tidmarsh\u2019s former business associates filed a lawsuit alleging that he made \u201cfalse and defamatory statements,\u201d during his time at the FDA.",
      "The lawsuit, brought by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, alleges that Tidmarsh used his FDA position to pursue a \u201clongstanding personal vendetta\u201d against the chair of the company\u2019s board of directors, Kevin Tang.",
      "Tang previously served as a board member of several drugmakers where Tidmarsh was an executive, including La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and was involved in his ouster from those leadership positions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Messages placed to Tidmarsh and his lawyer were not immediately returned late Sunday.",
      "Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California's pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.",
      "Tidmarsh\u2019s ouster is the latest in a string of haphazard leadership changes at the agency, which has been rocked for months by firings, departures and controversial decisions on vaccines, fluoride and other products.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad, who oversees FDA\u2019s vaccine and biologics center, resigned in July after coming under fire from conservative activists close to President Donald Trump, only to rejoin the agency two weeks later at the behest of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The FDA\u2019s drug center, which Tidmarsh oversaw, has lost more than 1,000 staffers over the past year to layoffs or resignations, according to agency figures. The center is the largest division of the FDA and is responsible for the review, safety and quality control of prescription and over-the-counter medicines.",

      "In the New York borough of the Bronx, about 200 more people than usual showed up at the World of Life Christian Fellowship International pantry, many bundled in winter hats and coats and pushing collapsible shopping carts as they waited in a line that spanned multiple city blocks. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches.",
      "Mary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her SNAP payments.

      "In an apparent response to President Donald Trump, who said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the government to report back by Monday on how it would fund SNAP accounts.",
      "McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday.",
      "The delay in SNAP payments, a major piece of the nation's social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Rev. John Udo-Okon said \u201cpeople from all walks of life\u201d are seeking help now.",
      "\u201cThe pantry is no longer for the poor, for the elderly, for the needy. The pantry now is for the whole community, everybody,\u201d Udo-Okon said. \u201cYou see people will drive in their car and come and park and wait to see if they can get food.\u201d",
      "In Austell, Georgia, people in hundreds of cars in drive-through lanes picked up nonperishable and perishable bags of food. Must Ministries said it handed out food to about 1,000 people, more than a typical bimonthly food delivery.",

Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",

      "\u201cPeople of good intention and good faith are going to have honest questions that they're not going to be able to get an answer for,\u201d Neas said.",
      "Some states have turned instead to law firms for advice, but there are not always clear answers. In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, a lot of districts are just going to continue to follow the old guidance because it\u2019s the best thing they have,\u201d Martin said.",

      "In total, at least six people have died and 27 have been sickened in 18 states in the outbreak that began in August 2024. The latest illnesses occurred in September and October, with the most recent on Oct. 16, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new deaths were reported in Hawaii and Oregon, the CDC said. Previous deaths were reported in Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Utah. One person who became ill was pregnant and it resulted in the death of a fetus.",
      "The outbreak has been traced to precooked pasta produced by Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. In September, the company recalled nearly 245,000 pounds (111,130 kilograms) of pasta, including cases of linguine, fettuccine, penne and other products sold to large producers of heat-and-eat meals and pasta salads.",
      "The move came after tests showed that pasta made by Nate's Fine Foods contained the same strain of listeria found in chicken fettuccine Alfredo and meatball linguine products identified in the outbreak. FreshRealm, the San Clemente, California, company that produced those meals, used genetic sequencing to confirm the link to the outbreak.",
      "Several national grocery stores have recalled dozens of products made with the affected pasta. People should check their refrigerators and freezers for the recalled foods and throw them away or return them to stores for a refund, officials said.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",
      "Swick\u2019s speech therapy services are provided by the Chicago-area business Memory and Aphasia Care. Owner Becky Khayum said many of her clients are in different cities and states and sought her therapists out because they specialize in frontal temporal dementias.",
      "\u201cNow suddenly without telehealth services, they do not continue to have the support to participate in those activities that are so important to them,\u201d Khayum said. \u201cThe risk is we could see social withdrawal; we could see depression and anxiety increased.\u201d",

Dr. Faraz Ghoddusi, a family medicine provider in Tigard, Oregon, said he uses telehealth to check in and help his patients manage their conditions, like diabetes and chronic lung disease. He said that in the current Medicare telehealth pause, one of his patients wasn\u2019t having regular check-ins and ended up in the emergency room.",
      "Susan Collins, 73, in Murrieta, California, said Medicare-reimbursed telehealth appointments were a \u201ctremendous relief\u201d to her when she was a full-time caregiver for her late husband, Leo. Before he died last year from progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder, she struggled to lift him from his wheelchair in and out of the car for his in-person doctor visits 60 miles from their home.",
      "\u201cHe was much safer at home,\u201d Collins said, noting that telehealth was a useful resource when her husband needed a medication or symptom consultation but not a complete physical exam.",
      "The latest guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not ban medical providers from providing telehealth services during the lapse \u2013 but it stops short of promising they\u2019ll be reimbursed if they do.",
      "In response, providers are deciding whether they can absorb the risk of continuing care without assurance that they\u2019ll be paid for it when the government reopens.",
      "Khayum in Illinois said she had to stop providing telehealth services to Medicare patients because her small business couldn\u2019t handle the volatility of potentially losing out on payments. Ghoddusi, the family medicine provider, said his Oregon practice is honoring telehealth appointments made before Oct. 1 but not scheduling additional ones for Medicare patients until the funding is restored.",
      "Genevieve Richardson, owner of a speech pathology business in Austin, Texas, has stopped providing telehealth services to her Medicare clients who are spread across the country. She has been referring them to outpatient clinics in their areas who can provide stopgap services in person.",
      "Major hospitals are also grappling with whether to provide virtual care to Medicare patients. Dr. Helen Hughes, medical director of the Office of Telemedicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the hospital initially continued the care, but paused scheduling more Medicare telehealth visits as of Oct. 16 as the shutdown continued.",
      "She said the uncertainty surrounding the waivers has been \u201ca total roller coaster.\u201d",
      "The government shutdown is in its fifth week with no clear end on the horizon. Meanwhile, Medicare telehealth flexibilities and a separate Medicare program offering patients hospital-level care at home both remain paused.",
      "Mei Kwong, executive director of the Center for Connected Health Policy, said the simplest solution to renewing the telehealth waivers would be for Congress to vote separately on them.",
      "The hands of federal health care administrators \u201care kind of tied,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you really do need Congress to act.\u201d",
      "But with lawmakers divided and looking for leverage, hopes for such action are low.",
      "Martha Swick, practicing word exercises with her husband in their home on a recent morning, said if a solution isn\u2019t found soon, \u201cmy resource collection is going to run out.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I\u2019m able to at home as a wife and a caregiver,\u201d she said. \u201cBut eventually I\u2019m really going to need those appointments to come back.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Alaska Supreme Court is weighing a case that is expected to determine who can provide abortion care in the state.",
      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state this year shows that the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year. The report says that could include cases where medication was provided to manage a miscarriage, but without providing a number. It also says reasons for ending pregnancies are not reported to the state.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a federal right to abortion, leaving it up to each state to regulate.",
      "Access to health care has been a longstanding concern in Alaska, with travel \u2014 sometimes covering hundreds of miles \u2014 required for many residents. Compounding that are ongoing challenges to recruit and keep medical providers.",

      "\u201cEven if an occasional patient were prevented from getting an abortion, the physician-only law is not unconstitutional as applied to all women who are not significantly affected by the law because the law has a plainly legitimate sweep,\u201d the filing states.",

      "BERLIN -- The organization that handles claims on behalf of Jews who suffered under the Nazis said Wednesday that Germany has agreed to extend another $1.076 billion (923.9 million euros) for Holocaust survivors ' home care around the globe for the coming year.",
      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",
      "\u201cWhile we are losing survivors at a rapid pace each year, those who remain are older, frailer and in greater need than ever before,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \"This budget is critical in providing each of them the opportunity to age in place, a dignity that was stolen from them in their youth.\u201d",
      "The average age of survivors receiving home care through Claims Conference funding has increased from 86 in 2018 to 88.5 in 2024. Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

      "At 27, she is the average age of new mothers in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She's feeling the pressure as an only child. Her father wants to be a grandfather and her mother, before she died, always told Porretto that she would eventually want to be a mom.",
      "\u201cSome people think it's a bad thing\u201d not to have a child, said Porretto, who works in advertising. \u201cI just don't think I need to bring more people into (the world) when there's so much here currently that we need to fix.\u201d",
      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children, according to several studies. They are worried about bringing children into a world with increasing and more intense extreme weather events, a result of climate change, which is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when oil, gas coal are burned. And they are concerned about the impact their offspring will have on the planet.",
      "In a 2024 Lancet study of people 16 to 25 years old, the majority of respondents were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about climate change. The study also found that 52% said they were hesitant to have children because of climate change. Adults under 50 years old without children were four times more likely than adults over 50 without children to say that climate plays a factor in their decision, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found more than half of respondents said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to whether climate change made them question having children.",
      "Parenthood and climate change are related not just because of fears for a child's well-being, but also by concern for the planet's well-being.",
      "Compared to the carbon emissions of all the other decisions, \"having a child is by far, by orders of magnitude, larger,\u201d said Nandita Bajaj, executive director of Population Balance, which is a nonprofit focused on humans' environmental impact.",
      "Unlike other choices, procreation comes with something that bioethics professor Travis Rieder of Johns Hopkins University calls \u201ccarbon legacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",

      "Seaweed has been farmed off Zanzibar, part of Tanzania's Indian Ocean coast, for decades but there is a new boom underway as global demand increases.",
      "Seaweed is primarily exported to the global food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, which extract their thickening and stabilizing agents.",
      "In Zanzibar, private investment and donor dollars have been increasing. Seaweed is the third largest contributor to the local economy after tourism and spices.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, people thought you were crazy for working in seaweed,\u201d said Klara Schade, director at Mwani Zanzibar, which describes itself as a boutique seaweed farm and factory in the village of Paje. \u201cNow it\u2019s become a buzzword.\u201d",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- In the Ugandan newsroom where he appeared one day as an intern, Zohran Mamdani looked shy and unassuming. His father had arranged for him to spend time at the Daily Monitor newspaper with hope that the teenager would show more interest in current affairs.",

      "Mamdani wanted to be a \u201ctop reporter,\u201d which is how Izama recalled saving the young man\u2019s number in his cellphone. While sports was the teen's passion, he also \u201chad insatiable curiosity about the world\u201d around him.",

      "Now the 34-year-old Mamdani, who has kept his Ugandan citizenship, could become New York City\u2019s first Muslim mayor and the first of Indian descent. Tuesday is the final day of voting as he faces Republican Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.",

      "\u201cI think he\u2019s basically global, not so much Ugandan and not so much American,\u201d Izama said.",
      "Mamdani was born in Kampala in 1991. His father is Mahmood Mamdani, a Columbia professor who taught for many years at Uganda\u2019s top public college, Makerere University, and whose academic writings are influential in the field of postcolonial studies.

      "A global hunger monitoring group reports that famine has spread to two regions in war-torn Sudan",
      "CAIRO -- Famine has spread to two regions of war-torn Sudan, including a major city in Darfur where paramilitary fighters have been rampaging the past week, a global hunger monitoring group said Monday, marking the latest crisis in a war that has created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian disaster.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine has been detected in the Darfur city of el-Fasher and the city of Kadugli in South Kordofan province. Twenty other areas in Darfur and Kordofan, where fighting intensified in recent months, are also at risk of famine, according to the IPC report.",
      "El-Fasher had been under siege by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces for 18 months, cutting off much of the food and other supplies to tens of thousands of people inside. Last week, RSF fighters seized the city, reportedly unleashing a wave of killings and attacks on its population that killed hundreds, though the scope of the violence is still unclear, with communications to the region poor.",
      "Kadugli, as well, has been under RSF siege for months with tens of thousands of people trapped inside, as the paramilitary group tries to seize further territory from its rival, the Sudanese military.",
      "Sudan has been torn apart since April 2023 by the fight for power between the military and RSF. More than 40,000 people have been killed, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The war has driven more than 14 million people from their home, fueled disease outbreaks and pushed parts of the country into famine.",
      "In its latest report, the second in less than a year, the IPC said famine \u2013 or IPC Phase 5 -- has been announced in el-Fasher and Kadugli, which it said experienced \u201ca total collapse of livelihoods, starvation, extremely high levels of malnutrition, and death.\u201d The IPC is considered the leading international authority on hunger crises.",
      "In total, about 375,000 people have been pushed into famine in Darfur and Kordofan as of September, the report said. Another 6.3 million people across the country are in IPC Phase 4, meaning they face extreme levels of hunger, it said.",
      "Save the Children said in September that food supplies had run out in Kadugli, where it said fighting had escalated. It said tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, many fleeing to other parts of the city because of roadblocks blocking escape.",
      "Famine, or IPC Phase 5, is determined in areas where at least one in five people or households severely lack food and face starvation and destitution, at least 30% of children under 5 suffer from acute malnutrition and deaths from malnutrition-related causes reach at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000.",
      "The IPC has only confirmed famine a few times in the past, most recently in northern Gaza earlier this year amid Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas. The other locations have been in Somalia in 2011, and South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and last year in parts of Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region.",
      "Another Kordofan town, Dilling, has reportedly experienced the same conditions as Kadugli, but the IPC didn\u2019t announce famine there for lack of data, the report said. Since the military retook the capital Khartoum earlier this year, the RSF has turned its focus to completing its hold on the Darfur region in the west and on taking Kordofan to secure supply lines toward the country\u2019s center.",

      "Hegseth and South Korean Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back received a briefing from military officials at Observation Post Ouellette, a site near the military demarcation line that past U.S. presidents, including Donald Trump during his first term in 2019, had visited to peer across the border into North Korea and meet with American soldiers.",
      "Hegseth and Ahn also visited the Panmunjom border village, where an armistice was signed to pause the 1950-53 Korean War. Ahn\u2019s ministry said the visit \u201creaffirmed the firm combined defense posture and close coordination\u201d between the allies.",

The leaders also advanced trade talks, addressing details of $350 billion in U.S. investments South Korea committed to in an effort to avoid the Trump administration\u2019s highest tariffs.",

      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court on Monday rejected a former Tiananmen vigil organizer's attempt to quash her indictment, pressing ahead with a landmark case widely seen as part of a years-long crackdown on the city's pro-democracy movement.",
      "Chow Hang-tung, a former leader of the group that organized a decades-old vigil to remember China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was charged in 2021 with inciting subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. She was charged together with two of the group's other former leaders, Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan.",
      "Their case was brought under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 to quell massive anti-government protests in 2019. The trio were accused of inciting others to challenge the leadership of the Communist Party by unlawful means.",
      "Chow, who is a barrister and is defending herself, argued that the indictment was unacceptably broad and vague because authorities did not specify an unlawful means. She said it could amount to a \u201ccatch-all charge.\u201d",
      "Judge Alex Lee remarked during the hearing that the charge was broad, but not vague.",
      "Prosecutor Ned Lai argued that unlawful means meant those against the Chinese constitution, which stipulates that the party's leadership is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and that damaging the socialist system is prohibited.",
      "The three-judge panel, approved by the government to oversee the case, ruled against Chow. Lee said the panel would issue an opinion in January.",
      "Chow appeared calm when she learned about the decision and smiled to the public gallery before leaving the courtroom.",
      "The Tiananmen vigil, organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, was the only large-scale public commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in China for decades until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures.",
      "The group came under increasing pressure as police opened an investigation, accusing it of being a foreign agent. The group rejected the allegations and refused to cooperate. Chow, Ho and Lee were later charged for violations of the National Security Law.",

      "Fans have been flocking to soccer matches in Jalisco, Mexico, as authorities fine-tune security for the 2026 FIFA World Cup",
      "GUADALAJARA, Mexico -- Fans flocking to a soccer match in Zapopan chanted \u201cMexico! Mexico!\u201d while walking past dozens of police officers, bomb-sniffing dogs, metal detectors and drone jammers \u2014 as authorities fine-tuned security ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A few miles away, south of Guadalajara, a different sort of deployment was underway: National Guard troops stood sentry as volunteers dug up the small patio of an abandoned house looking for some of Mexico\u2019s 134,000 disappeared.",
      "It's a jarring contrast especially present in Jalisco, where 48,000-seat soccer stadiums and fan zones \u2014 like the site of the Oct. 14 friendly match between Mexico and Ecuador \u2014 coexist with one of the world\u2019s most powerful criminal organizations. The state \u2014 which will host four World Cup matches in June 2026 \u2014 is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, arguably Mexico\u2019s most powerful with an estimated 19,000 members and operations spanning 21 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states.",
      "With a population of 8 million, Jalisco leads in disappearances and is among Mexico\u2019s top four states for crime rate. As of October, the state had reported approximately 1,000 disappearances \u2014 a 30% surge compared to the same period the previous year, according to Mexico\u2019s National Search Commission.",
      "Yet, neither the soccer fans attending the recent soccer match, nor the officials securing the site expressed concern about hosting an international sporting event on the home turf of the Jalisco cartel. The reasons offered varied, spanning the notion of a temporary, tacit truce between criminals and the government, to the inherent security boost that such major events provide.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get yourself into trouble, nothing will happen,\u201d said Javier Rodr\u00edguez, an 18-year-old college student on his way to the stadium.",
      "South of Guadalajara, off the highway that leads to the snowbird destination of Lake Chapala, Indira Navarro and a group of volunteers dug up the concrete slab behind an abandoned house following a tip that human remains were buried there.",
      "They\u2019re members of the Jalisco Search Warriors, one of many volunteer groups across Mexico who spend their free time searching for the missing, hoping to find their own relatives or bring closure to another family.",
      "They didn\u2019t find anything that morning. However, earlier this year the team searched a ranch near Guadalajara \u2014 a site authorities raided the prior year \u2014 unearthing hundreds of garments and burned bone fragments that left authorities scrambling to explain why the initial investigation of the purported cartel recruitment and training site had been so shoddy.",
      "Navarro is searching for her brother who disappeared in the neighboring state of Sonora in 2015. Since March, she has lived with round-the-clock protection of the National Guard because of the death threats she received after publicizing the group\u2019s discovery at the ranch.",
      "The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which the Trump administration designated a foreign terrorist organization earlier this year, has established itself as Mexico\u2019s most powerful criminal organization. It earned its reputation through bold attacks on authorities, such as downing a Mexican military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade and attempting a spectacular ambush of a Mexico City police chief in 2020.",
      "Experts say there has not been a criminal organization so powerful in Jalisco since the late 1980s, the last time Guadalajara hosted international matches during the 1986 World Cup.",
      "Roberto Alarc\u00f3n, Jalisco\u2019s state security strategy coordinator, downplayed the local cartel\u2019s presence while simultaneously suggesting that their dominance actually makes security efforts easier.",
      "\u201cNot having a great number of criminal groups like other states allows \u2026 security authorities to attack these groups in a better, more controlled way,\" said Alarc\u00f3n, adding that all major crimes in the state are, in fact, trending downward.",
      "Security analyst David Saucedo expects to see a tacit agreement between the cartel and the government, in which security forces would hold off on operations to capture cartel leaders, provided the cartel avoids any high-profile actions.",

      "Organized crime, he said, will take advantage of the World Cup to \u201cincrease its criminal activity\u201d in casinos, street-level drug sales, sexual tourism and reselling tickets, he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to enjoy the World Cup themselves.\u201d",
      "A day before the Oct. 14 friendly match, Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus, local politicians and soccer federation officials spoke to the media about the investments being made ahead of the World Cup and the advantages of having Jalisco as a host. Security concerns and preparedness were notably absent from the discussion.",
      "Jalisco officials say the 2026 World Cup is expected to generate $1 billion in revenues for the state and create up to 7,000 jobs, primarily in the tourism and construction sectors, as the area rushes to add 12,000 new hotel rooms before the tournament.",
      "\u201cThe 2026 World Cup is a great opportunity for Jalisco to position itself before the world,\u201d Lemus told reporters.",
      "The following night, Johana Jaramillo, a 42-year-old event producer working at a fan zone outside the stadium, confronted the stark paradox of hosting a major international event in a place so steeped in suffering.",
      "\u201cThese events help slightly repair social pain and bring the opportunity for better security measures simply because so many people are attending,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to drone jammers and armored vehicles, Jalisco is installing 3,000 additional surveillance cameras, pushing the state\u2019s total past 10,000, a legacy of the World Cup that could continue to benefit residents after the tournament ends.",
      "But for those like Navarro, who have dedicated their lives to searching for loved ones with little help from authorities, the World Cup hype feels like whitewashing Jalisco\u2019s violence.",
      "\u201cThey want to wash away everything that has to do with the issue of the disappeared,\" she said. \"But they won\u2019t be able to do so because we\u2019re going to continue fighting.\u201d",

      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- A powerful 6.3 magnitude earthquake shook northern Afghanistan before dawn Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring more than 640 others, as well as damaging the historic Blue Mosque, officials said.",
      "The numbers of people killed or injured could rise, officials said.",
      "In the town of Khulm, near the epicenter, people dug through the rubble of collapsed mud brick homes with shovels and picked through debris to salvage what belongings they could.",
      "Local resident Ahmad Zia said the air was polluted from all the dust that rose from the ruins of houses. \u201cWe pulled the bodies of two people from the rubble, and their funerals will be held today,\u201d he said.",
      "Footage on social media from Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkh province, showed several bricks had fallen from the walls of the Blue Mosque but the structure remained intact. The centuries-old site, one of Afghanistan\u2019s most revered religious landmarks, is a major gathering place during Islamic and cultural festivals.",
      "The impoverished country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions. Buildings tend to be low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and outlying areas made from mud bricks and wood, many poorly built.",
      "In August, a quake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 2,200 people.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake\u2019s epicenter was located 22 kilometers (14 miles) west-southwest of the town of Khulm, and that it struck at 12:59 a.m. at a depth of 28 kilometers (17 miles).",
      "The deputy spokesman for Afghanistan's National Disaster Management Authority, Qari Taj Mohammad Hemat, said the earthquake had struck Balkh, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul, and Kunduz provinces and had left 20 people dead and 643 others injured, of whom 25 were in critical condition.",

      "In the nearby province of Badakhshan, the quake partially or completely destroyed 800 houses in one village in the Shahr-e-Bozorg district, said Ihsanullah Kamgar, spokesperson for the provincial police headquarters. But with a lack of internet in the remote area, there were still no accurate casualty figures, he added.",
      "Yousaf Hammad, a spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s disaster management agency, said most of the injured suffered minor wounds and were discharged after treatment.",

It said some people who were injured and trapped along the highway were transported to the hospital.",

In a statement, he offered condolences to the families of the victims, prayed for the swift recovery of the injured, and said that Pakistan stands with the Afghan people in this difficult time.",
      "His statement came as the two countries were engaged in rounds of peace talks amid heightened tension after deadly clashes on the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Pakistan accuses the Taliban government of sheltering members of the Pakistani Taliban and failing to curb cross-border attacks. Afghan officials reject the allegations, saying they seek good relations. Another round of peace talks is scheduled for this week in Istanbul, Turkey.",

      "Until this year, no president had used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs since its enactment in 1977.",

      "Dozens of centers are missing out on federal grant payments that were due to arrive Nov. 1. Some say they'll close indefinitely, while others are staying afloat with emergency funding from local governments and school districts. The closures mean Head Start students \u2014 who come from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care \u2014 are missing out on preschool, where they are fed two meals a day and receive therapy vital to their development.",
      "\u201cChildren love school, and the fact that they can\u2019t go is breaking their hearts,\u201d said Sarah Sloan, who oversees small-town Head Start centers in Scioto County, Ohio. Staff told families they planned to close Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s hampering our families\u2019 ability to put food on the table and to know that their children are safe during the day.\u201d",
      "A half-dozen Head Start programs never received grants that were anticipated in October, but there are now 140 programs that have not received their annual infusion of federal funding. All told, the programs have capacity to assist 65,000 preschoolers and expectant parents.",
      "Among the preschools closing as of Monday are 24 Migrant and Seasonal Head Start centers spread across five states. Those centers, created to assist the children of migrant farmworkers, typically operate on 10- to 12-hour days to accommodate the long hours parents work on farms.",
      "Children attending the centers in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma recently came home with fliers warning of possible closures, along with other parent notifications. Those centers serving more than 1,100 children will now remain closed until the shutdown ends, said East Coast Migrant Head Start Project CEO Javier Gonzalez. About 900 staff members across the centers also have been furloughed.",

      "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- Abu Dhabi opened a major oil summit Monday with officials offering bullish optimism that power demands for artificial intelligence and global aviation will boost energy prices, just hours after OPEC+ paused production increases planned for next year.",
      "The comments at the annual Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference in the Emirati capital highlighted the contradictions in the market and in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil producer that hosted the United Nations COP28 climate talks in 2023.",
      "Sultan al-Jaber, the head of the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. who led COP28, described the energy market as needing \u201creinforcement, not replacement.\u201d U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum applauded al-Jaber's remarks and criticized what he described as \u201ca set of policies that have been driven by an ideology around climate extremism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe demand for power is going to go up and up and up,\" Burgum said. \"Today\u2019s the day to announce that there is no energy transition. There is only energy addition.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, OPEC+ met and decided to increase its production by an additional 137,000 barrels of oil beginning in December. However, it said other adjustments planned in January, February and March of next year would be paused \u201cdue to seasonality.\u201d",
      "OPEC+ includes the core members of the cartel, as well as nations outside of the group led by Russia.",
      "Benchmark Brent crude sold Monday around $65 a barrel, down from a post-COVID high of some $115 a barrel after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It had fallen to $60 a barrel in recent days over concerns that the market had too much production.",
      "\u201cYes, OPEC+ is blinking, but it\u2019s a calculated move,\u201d said Jorge Le\u00f3n, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy. \u201cSanctions on Russian producers have injected a new layer of uncertainty into supply forecasts, and the group knows that overproducing now could backfire later. By pausing, OPEC+ is protecting prices, projecting unity and buying time to see how sanctions play out on Russian barrels.\u201d",
      "Suhail al-Mazerouei, the Emirates' energy and infrastructure minister, however, dismissed any idea long-term of too much oil being in the market.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about a an oversupply scenario,\" he said. \"I can\u2019t see that. I can\u2019t justify that. And I think all of what we are seeing is more demand.\u201d",
      "Burgum, a former Republican governor of North Dakota and the chair of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s National Energy Dominance Council, was on hand for the Abu Dhabi oil summit on Monday. He praised the partnership oil-producing Gulf Arab states have with America, saying: \"We share a belief about energy policy.\u201d",

One is Iran could not have a nuclear weapon,\" Burgum said. \u201cBut the second thing is that the free world cannot lose the AI arms race. ... You need chips, you need software models and you need more electricity.\u201d",
      "The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S., a key economic and political indicator in the country, stood at $3.03 on Monday. Trump also has criticized both OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia at times over the price per barrel, particularly in his first term.",
      "Meanwhile, both the United States and the United Kingdom implemented new oil sanctions targeting Russia over its war on Ukraine. Those sanctions targets included Rosneft and the Russian oil company Lukoil, whose red-and-white logo hung over the annual oil conference. The UAE has maintained close ties to Russia despite the war, but has served as a key interlocutor between Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate prisoner exchanges.",
      "\u201cThe Russian and Ukraine war is being funded by energy sales,\u201d Burgum said on a stage that had flashed the Lukoil logo before his remarks.",
      "The oil conference comes after the UAE hosted COP28. Those talks ended with a call by nearly 200 countries to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels \u2014 the first time the conference made that crucial pledge. Scientists have called for drastically slashing the world\u2019s emissions by nearly half in the coming years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times.",

      "Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi repeated a warning to the European Union that his nation could halt their liquefied natural gas shipments \u2014 something crucial due to Russian LNG being banned \u2014 over its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. That seeks to have companies pursue net-zero emission goals.",
      "\u201cI think, you know, a small part of this conference, unfortunately, changes with politics depending on when it was President Biden and President Trump and so on,\" al-Kaabi said. \"I think that they're not looking at facts and realities and I think we shouldn't be following politics when we look at the lives of people for the future and how much energy we need in the future.\u201d",

      "In three weekends \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has made $61.5 million domestically and $104.7 million globally. Universal also handled the nationwide re-release of Robert Zemeckis\u2019s \u201cBack to the Future\u201d which earned $4.7 million from 2,290 theaters \u2013 enough to snag a fifth-place spot on the North American charts. The 1985 time travel classic now has a domestic total of $221.7 million.",
      "Though there were plenty of HUNTR/X costumes on the streets this weekend, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d didn\u2019t do as well as it did when it played in theaters in August. That weekend, the streaming hit sold between $16 and $20 million in movie tickets. This weekend, it\u2019s estimated to have earned somewhere in the $5 million range from 2,890 screens. Two distribution executives shared numbers on the condition of anonymity because Netflix has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Sony Pictures and Crunchyroll\u2019s \u201cChainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc\u201d dropped a steep 67% in its second weekend and is projected to add $6 million from 3,003 locations, bringing its total to $30.8 million.",
      "Focus Features also launched \u201cBugonia\u201d into wide release after several weeks in limited. With an estimated $4.8 million from 2,043 theaters, it marks filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s best wide break to date. The darkly comedic thriller stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons and is expected to be an awards season player.",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere\u201d landed in sixth place, behind \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d and down 57% in its second weekend. It earned $3.8 million, putting its domestic total at $16.3 million and its global tally at $30.6 million.",
      "\u201cThis was a truly scary weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt was this imperfect storm of Halloween on a Friday and the World Series on Friday and Saturday. But the studios and theaters knew this was on the horizon and they planned for it.\u201d",
      "The weekend may net out to be one of the lowest grossing of the year, closing out an unusually slow October. With the exception of October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the month\u2019s total ticket sales ($443 million) have not been this low since 1998 ($455.5 million).",
      "The next two weekends may bring some energy back to multiplexes, however, with releases like \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d and \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don\u2019t,\u201d but the industry will likely have to wait until closer to Thanksgiving for a real blockbuster when \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2\u201d enter the mix.",
      "\"This was always going to be a tough weekend. The audience was truly fragmented,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere are weekends where the movie theaters are the focus of the attention, and those are coming.\"",

      "Profits improved thanks to a mild hurricane season and more paper investment.",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The profits of Warren Buffett's company improved 17% thanks to a relatively mild hurricane season and more paper investment gains this year as Berkshire Hathaway continues to prepare for the legendary 95-year-old investor to relinquish the CEO title in January.",
      "But last month's $9.7 billion investment in OxyChem won't do much to diminish the $381.7 billion cash pile that Berkshire was sitting on at the end of September even though it is the biggest deal the company has made in years.",
      "The biggest thing on most investors' minds right now is that Buffett Vice Chair Greg Abel is set to succeed him as CEO in January, although Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire. The Class A stock is well off its peak of $812,855, set just before Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting in May by announcing he will step back. It closed Friday at $715,740, but Berkshire still didn't buy back any of its own stock in the quarter, which suggests Buffett thinks it is still overvalued.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she expects investors will clamor for more details from Berkshire after Abel takes over, and that calls for the company to finally pay a dividend if it can't find better uses for all that cash will also grow louder. But with Buffett remaining chairman there may not be any immediate changes.",
      "\u201cThe lack of discussion and disclosure \u2014 I think has a lot of the investment community frustrated,\u201d Seifert said. Berkshire has never had public or investor relations departments, and the company skips the quarterly investor calls that nearly every public company holds. Buffett has long said he prefers to share results with every investor at the same time, on Saturdays, and give them the weekend to digest the results before the markets reopen.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that it earned $30.796 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's up from last year's $26.251 billion, or $18,272 per A share.",
      "But those bottom-line figures are always distorted by the current value of Berkshire's massive investment portfolio and any stock sales, which this year added $17.3 billion to the company's profits.",

      "On that measure, Berkshire's operating profit jumped to $13.485 billion, or $9376.15 per Class A share, thanks to a strong rebound in its insurance companies. A year ago, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings of $8,573.50 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire said fewer catastrophic losses from hurricanes this year compared to when Hurricane Helene ravaged the southeast a year ago helped its insurance underwriting profit jump $1.6 billion to $2.369 billion. The bottom line was also helped by $331 million in gains on debt held in foreign currencies this year, compared to a $1.1 billion loss on those holdings a year ago.",

      "Black vultures have killed and eaten several calves on Tom Karr\u2019s cattle ranch in southeastern Ohio, a loss he says didn't happen two decades ago",
      "EMINENCE, Ky. -- Allan Bryant scans the sky as he watches over a minutes-old calf huddled under a tree line with its mother. After a few failed tries, the calf stands on wobbly legs for the first time, looking to nurse.",
      "Above, a pair of birds circle in the distance. Bryant, hoping they're not black vultures, is relieved to see they're only turkey vultures \u2014 red-headed and not aggressive.",
      "\u201cHonestly, the black vulture is one of the ugliest things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to hate.\u201d",
      "Black vultures, scavengers that sometimes attack and kill sick or newborn animals, didn't used to be a problem here. But now Bryant frequently sees the birds following a birth. He hasn't lost a calf in several years, but they've killed his animals before. So now he takes measures to stop them.",
      "In some of his fields, he erects a scarecrow of sorts \u2014 a dead black vulture \u2014 aimed at scaring off the birds. It's a requirement of his depredation permit through the Kentucky Farm Bureau, which allows him to shoot a few birds a year. The dead bird keeps the live birds away for about a week, but they eventually come back, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that may grow worse for cattle farmers as the scavenging birds\u2019 range expands northward, in part due to climate change. Lobbying groups have been pushing for legislation that would allow landowners to kill more of these birds, which are protected but not endangered. But experts say more research is needed to better understand how the birds impact livestock and how their removal could affect ecosystems.",
      "Black vultures used to mainly live in the southeastern U.S. and farther south in Latin and South America, but over the past century they've started to rapidly stretch northward and also west into the desert Southwest, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration.",
      "Warmer winters on average, fueled by climate change, are making it easier for the birds to stay in places that used to be too cold for them. What's more, the human footprint in suburban and rural areas is enriching their habitat: development means cars, and cars mean roadkill. Cattle farms can also offer a buffet of vulnerable animals for vultures that learn the seasonal calving schedule.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from a lot of different studies of birds, it\u2019s that they are very good at taking advantage of food resources and remembering where those things are,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Although black vultures are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, they aren't really a migratory species, he said. Instead, they breed, and some disperse to new areas and settle there.",
      "After losing a calf to a black vulture a decade ago, Tom Karr, who raises cattle near Pomeroy, Ohio, tried to move his fall calving season later in the year in hopes the vultures would be gone by then. But that didn't help \u2014 the birds stay all year, he said.",
      "Until newborn calves are a few days old, \u201cwe try to keep them up closer to the barns,\u201d said Joanie Grimes, the owner of a 350-head calf-cow operation in Hillsboro, Ohio. She said they've been dealing with the birds for 15 years, but keeping them out of remote fields has helped improve matters.",
      "Annette Ericksen has noticed the black vultures for several years on her property, Twin Maples Farm in Milton, West Virginia, but they haven't yet lost any animals to them. When they expect calves and lambs, they move the livestock into a barn, and they also use dogs \u2014 Great Pyrenees \u2014 trained to patrol the fields and the barnyard for raptors that might hurt the animals.",

Farmers said calves can be worth hundreds of dollars or upward of $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the breed.",
      "In March, lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill that would let farmers capture or kill any black vulture \u201cin order to prevent death, injury, or destruction to livestock.\u201d Many farmers and others in the cattle industry have supported the move, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in July commended the House Natural Resources Committee for advancing the bill.",

      "Orb\u00e1n said Friday that both the U.S. administration and Moscow were seeking an end to the war, but that Ukraine and the EU were the primary impediments to peace. However, a planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest was recently scrapped after Russian officials made clear they opposed an immediate ceasefire in the conflict.",

      "Lambert, a critically endangered African penguin, has moved to a special geriatric island at the New England Aquarium in Boston",
      "BOSTON -- When Lambert started losing his vision and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends.",
      "But he couldn't be placed in just any nursing home \u2014 because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it sort of started off as a joke. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, well, why don\u2019t we give them an old folks home?\u2019\u201d Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. \u201cBut the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.\u201d",
      "The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don't have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.",
      "The enclosure has some flatter topography and a carpeted path down to the water, which allows Lambert and the other penguins to better navigate up and down the island. The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.",
      "As a result, Mia Luzietti, a senior penguin trainer at the aquarium, said she has seen Lambert become more active since moving to the new island \u2014 swimming more with his mate and getting off the island more often.",
      "The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world \u2014 what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans\u2019 overfishing.",
      "\u201cIt's really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,\u201d Luzietti said.",
      "\u201cSo learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,\u201d she added.",

      "Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure.",
      "The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans \u2014 such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds.",
      "\u201cWe are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,\u201d Luzietti said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re picking up on those \u2014 from how someone\u2019s hips are moving, how they\u2019re walking, how they are acting, if someone\u2019s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert \u2014 who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey's bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation.",
      "Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.",
      "A crowd had formed around the enclosure to watch, including Terri Blessman, a 69-year-old tourist from Canton, Illinois, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her friend Lou Ann Delost. Hearing about Lambert's age and the care he gets, Blessman said she could relate.",
      "\u201cThat's wonderful,\u201d Blessman said. \u201cAll of us older people need extra care as we get older.\u201d",

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive world of animal research",
      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",
      "\u201cIt is highly unusual \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that Tulane refuses to identify its partner in this shipment,\u201d Jones-Engel added.",
      "Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prevent the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to The Associated Press. That's done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.",
      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

      "The Mississippi crash is one of at least three major monkey escapes in the U.S. over the past four years.",
      "Last November, 43 Rhesus macaques escaped from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research after an enclosure wasn't fully locked. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "In January 2022, several cynomolgus macaque monkeys escaped when a truck towing a trailer of about 100 of the animals collided with a dump truck on a Pennsylvania highway, authorities said. The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",

      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",

Earlier this week, reports said that the \u201cYellowstone\u201d creator was leaving Paramount for an overall film and television deal at NBCUniversal valued at some $1 billion across five years. Representatives for NBCUniversal declined to comment.",
      "The announcement also comes on the heels of mass layoffs at Paramount, just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of a planned 2,000 layoffs company-wide on Wednesday.",

      "Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are developing tiny drones inspired by bats for search and rescue missions",

      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "The excavation project itself began after artifacts began appearing on the beach around 2007. Part of the site that washed out had been excavated previously.",

      "When he left in July, there was a roughly 30-foot buffer to the sea. The storm took out the buffer and another 30 feet of the site, he said. It also left what Knecht described as piano-sized clumps of tundra on the tidal flats.",

      "\u201cI just drove right by it because all the landmarks I\u2019m used to on the beach and at the site were gone or changed,\u201d he said.",
      "Work to preserve the rescued artifacts has included soaking the marine salts from the wood and placing the pieces in special chemicals that will help them hold together when they dry out, he said. If one were to just take one of the wooden artifacts off the beach and let them dry, they'd \u201ccrack to pieces, sometimes in a matter of hours.\u201d",

      "The news of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s accelerating growth in revenue and profit comes on the heels of a court ruling in the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s landmark monopoly case against Google\u2019s dominant search engine that was widely seen as a mild rebuke that wouldn\u2019t hobble the company.",
      "Alphabet performed like a powerhouse during the July-September period, delivering a profit of nearly $35 billion, or $2.87 per share, a 33% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% from last year to $102.3 billion. Both figures easily exceeded the analysts' projections that steer the stock market.",
      "Investors celebrated the third-quarter numbers by driving up Alphabet\u2019s stock price nearly 5% in Wednesday\u2019s extended trading.",
      "That\u2019s on top of a 30% surge in Alphabet\u2019s shares that has created nearly $770 billion in stockholder wealth since early September. That\u2019s when U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected a Justice Department proposal to break up Google to curb the abuses of a search engine that was declared an illegal monopoly last year.",
      "Mehta\u2019s cautious handling of Google\u2019s search monopoly largely reflected his belief that rapid advances in artificial intelligence technology have already been spawning conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d from rising tech stars such as ChatGPT and Perplexity that are giving consumers more options.",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI and Perplexity have released AI-powered web browsers to compete against Google\u2019s industry-leading Chrome browser that the Justice Department had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Mehta to order to be sold.",

In a sign of the inroads those efforts are making, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai disclosed Wednesday that Google's AI-powered Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users.",
      "Like other major tech companies, Google has been bankrolling its AI ambitions with a spending spree that has raised worries about a potential bubble that will eventually burst. Alphabet now expects to budget $91 billion to $93 billion for capital expenditures this year, up from $85 billion in its previous quarterly report issued in July, with most of the money earmarked for the massive data centers needed to power AI.",
      "Alphabet has the luxury of drawing upon a lucrative ad network that Google has spent a quarter century building. Google\u2019s ad sales totaled $74.2 billion in the third quarter, a 13% increase from last year.",
      "The AI craze has been a boon for Google\u2019s Cloud division that oversees data centers for other companies, an endeavor that has turned into the fastest growing part of Alphabet. Google Cloud posted revenue of $15.2 billion in the past quarter, up 34% from last year.",
      "Although Google appears to have fared relatively well in the legal attack on its search engine, it still faces a potentially damaging blow in another case brought by the Justice Department against the technology underlying its ad network.",
      "After condemning parts of Google\u2019s ad technology as an illegal monopoly earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema is considering ways to handcuff the company in the future. The Justice Department is seeking a court order to force Google to sell pieces of its ad network \u2014 an issue that Brinkema isn\u2019t expected to rule on until early next year.",

      "The crash investigators are particularly concerned because only about 12% of the 1,883 planes that might be affected have been inspected so far even though their maker, Bombardier, recommended it in March \u2014 not long after the crash in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

      "The FAA did not immediately respond to questions about the recommendations Wednesday.",
      "Investigators looking into why the Learjet in question veered off a runway in Arizona and hit a business jet, killing one person, quickly determined that the left main landing gear had separated from the plane upon landing.

    "story": [
      "Producing and manufacturing electric vehicles and their batteries uses a lot of energy, leading many to be skeptical about the environmental benefits of going electric",
      "DETROIT -- Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.",
      "The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.",
      "The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.",
      "\u201cWhile there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you\u2019re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,\" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.",
      "The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.",
      "Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.",
      "They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest \u2014 a 31% share of vehicle sales \u2014 to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)",
      "The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",
      "The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is \u201cnot only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,\u201d said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.",
      "Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it a \u201cvaluable study\u201d that echoes other findings and \u201cconfirms the environmental and economic benefits\u201d of EVs.",
      "\u201cAccelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody\u2019s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.\"",
      "Outside experts agreed \u2014 as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.",

But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.",

      "If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s order was meant to enable an American-led group of investors to buy the app from China\u2019s ByteDance, though the deal also requires China\u2019s approval.",

      "The president is expected to be engaged in the midterms, campaigning for Republican candidates and having a hand in messaging and candidate selection, a Republican official close to the White House told ABC News, in order to prevent messy primaries or bids from non-Trump-aligned options.",
      "\"[The White House is] very involved in making sure we have the right candidates next year, that we're backing the right folks and that we're basically prepared and ready to go,\" the official told ABC News. \"The thinking basically started even before the president took office, like it's been a fantastic change compared to 2017, 2018.\"",
      "\"People on our side remember what it was like to deal with all of these investigations ... and how much it distracted and hurt the president's agenda. So I do think, especially on our side, when we're talking to our base, we're going to remind voters, you need to get out and vote to give the president a full four years.\"",
      "To win races, Republicans are strategizing on how to mobilize Trump voters, whose turnout has historically been lower in off-presidential election cycles, the Republican official and other GOP political operatives said. Ongoing pushes from Trump and other Republicans for mid-cycle redistricting in order to gain additional House seats are another way the party is shoring up its chances for victory.",
      "A year out from the midterms, an\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0published on Sunday finds 46% of registered voters saying they would support the Democratic candidate in House races if the election were held today. That's a significant drop from a\u00a0November 2017 ABC News/Washington Post poll, when voters had an 11-percentage-point preference for Democratic candidates.",
      "\u201cWhile Democrats face historically low approval ratings, a Sanders\u2019 socialists vs. Schumer\u2019s favorites proxy war for control of their Party, and an identity crisis after a decade of standing for nothing except hating President Trump, Republicans are united behind an agenda of promises made, promises kept to American working families who want to see Washington focused on the issues that matter to them,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to ABC.",

      "Trump has confirmed what could be one of the largest mobilization strategies for the party-- a 'midterm convention' ahead of the 2026 races.",
      "\"The Republicans are going to do a Midterm Convention in order to show the great things we have done since the Presidential Election of 2024,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform in September.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are cognizant of Republicans' ramped up mobilization efforts, attempting to counter them by making strides early to be more competitive in future races.",
      "\"One thing that the Republicans have done, and quite sophisticatedly, is they run a permanent campaign. They never stop organizing.

      "Republicans dedicated to avoiding contentious primaries, National Republican operatives say",
      "Republicans are not struggling this cycle with having many messy primaries, with the White House and the national Republican Party steering Republican candidates in key toss-up races in order to fend off messy primaries and secure swing districts with Trump-aligned candidates, the Republican official said, echoing several GOP operatives interviewed for this story.",
      "\"I think that speaks volumes about the way that we're operating this time, compared to what it was like during the first administration,\" the Republican official close to the White House said.",
      "They're also looking to leverage Democrats' apparent lack of party unity, which has contributed to several messy Senate primary fights in key battleground states like Maine, Michigan, Texas and Iowa.",
      "\"Our ducks are in a row,\" the official said, \"it's an advantage that the Democrats had in '22 that we didn't-- messy primaries this time around, that script is completely flipped.\"",
      "While Republicans have largely avoided significant MAGA proxy battles, a few have still percolated. In Kentucky, Trump has weighed in against Rep. Thomas Massie, endorsing the\u00a0six-term congressmember's challenger over his opposition to the GOP megabill that's been Trump's chief achievement on the Hill this Congress.",
      "In Louisiana, incumbent Sen. Bill Cassidy is facing several primary challengers after his past criticism of Trump.",
      "A messy primary is also brewing in Texas, but is viewed as less of a MAGA-on-MAGA battle, and more of a personal fight between Trump loyalist Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who has also been a longtime ally of the president.",

      "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.",
      "At the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Not to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.",
      "Yet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.",
      "Now, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.",
      "One of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.",
      "\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.",
      "On June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.",
      "The salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.",
      "The mocking never let up.",
      "'Newsom Derangement Syndrome'",
      "A non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.",
      "Since then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.",
      "One of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.",
      "Newsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.",
      "A key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"",
      "'It feels very unrestrained'",
      "\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies.",
      "\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.",
      "When Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views.",

      "\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.",
      "'Holding a mirror to the clown show'",
      "Newsom's longtime speechwriter and former deputy chief of staff Jason Eliott described the online mockery as a strategy of \"holding up a mirror to the clown show that is the Trump administration. We're not doing anything differently than what they are doing.\"",
      "Elliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday,\u00a0will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.",
      "\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.",
      "Newsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred.",
      "\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.",
      "John Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"",
      "\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.",
      "But he admits it appears to be working.",
      "\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats. And he's got good people around him,\" Dennis said. \"They know that Trump is the center of the universe right now so he's just keeping his name alive and positioning himself as the Trump fighter -- and he's going to run that all the way into the Democrat primaries.\"",
      "Dan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.",
      "\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"",

      "Christine Matthews, a pollster for former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, told ABC News that young Hispanic men will be \"really critical\" in 2026 -- a group Trump won last year by 10 points -- as they represent \"strong economic cost-of-living voters.\"",
      "Trump won 48% of Latino voters in 2024 -- nearly as many voters as Vice President Kamala Harris. The large Latino populations of Arizona and Nevada particularly played an outsized role in boosting Trump to victory and helping him secure these critical swing states.",
      "Jennifer Benz, deputy director of the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, referenced immigration as another factor that might bring Hispanic voters back to the fringes. Much of their dissatisfaction stems from the immigration tactics being implemented, she said, even if voters are aligned with the president's views at a higher level.",
      "Black voters",
      "While Black voters remain predominantly Democratic, their support for Trump nearly doubled in 2024. Black voters were likely influenced by the economy as well, according to Ashley Konig, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.",
      "Yet Trump's economic promises appear to be falling short, with the Black unemployment rate climbing to 7.5% this year, its highest point since October 2021.",
      "Matthews referenced a \"notable [swing] among younger Black men\" toward Trump in 2024 -- a group that has been drifting away from the Democratic party since 2020. The way the economy shakes out over the next year is likely to influence their voting decisions, she said, similar to young Hispanic men.",
      "Marcus James, a 43-year-old from Alabama, told ABC News that he \"totally regret[s]\" voting for Trump in 2016, pointing to his identity as a Black man and criticizing the administration for their treatment of minorities.",
      "\"The big question leading into 2026 is, will those same inroads that [Trump] made in '24 carry over? Or will Democrats be able to win back their near-unanimous support among Black voters and their majority support among Hispanic voters?\" Konig said.",
      "Non-voters",
      "Some voters could swing in the direction of not voting at all, with Lake pointing to a swath of reliably blue voters who sat out in 2024 due to disillusionment with both parties.",

      "\"This is a group of voters who report in '24 that -- just by a small margin -- that they had sort of been leaning towards Trump, but now they're split on the generic ballot,\" Matthews told ABC, nicknaming them \"weighted vest women.\"",

      "A new Quinnipiac Poll taken in the final days of the race found that 25% of likely voters say taxes are the most important issue in deciding who to vote for.",

      "Several ABC News interviews with Democratic strategists, current and former national staffers, and state-level officials raise several questions from within the party of how to best shift perceptions ahead of the midterms: does the party go full bore on anti-Trump messaging as the navigate the politics of the ongoing government shutdown and voters feel the pinch? Do they focus, instead, on boosting progressive rising stars even as Republicans paint the party as too-radical?",
      "Some less conventional Democrats question whether the party should bother relying on the traditional leadership structure, who may lean too much on outdated tactics, in Washington at all. While other, more traditional members, argue they're not in as much disarray as their critics claim.",
      "Democrats in Washington point to recent wins as proof that their brand is not as toxic as some critics claim: two Republican legislative district flips in Iowa; electing a Democrat in a Pennsylvania state senate seat for the first time in 130 years; elevating a Democratic mayor to lead Omaha's blue dot, for example.",
      "They're banking on likely successes in the days-away gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey (and to a lesser extent, dominance in New York City's mayoral race) as reputational defibrillators a year out from the midterms.",
      "\"We have the momentum, certainly, heading into this final stretch,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told ABC News in a recent interview, of anticipated wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania's supreme court races.",

But to me, people complaining tells me that they care a whole lot, and I think that that's valuable. And also, frankly, we can listen to that stuff and still do our jobs every day to elect Democrats,\" said Schneider.",
      "\"We went from being the party of cool with Barack Obama to turning into the party of nerds and dweebs and losers, right? What is really annoying about all of it is that we have winners. We have good stars,\" the second staffer continued. told ABC News.",

And it's important that the leadership right now provides that,\" said Harrison, who says he trusts Martin and believes support, from donors and otherwise, will return after Democratic wins on Tuesday.",

      "Some Democrats also point to Martin's tenure as one that prioritizes infrastructure. For example, state parties now get major influxes of cash, to the tune of a million dollars a month, to hire staff, set up programs, and fortify their ranks. \"Party changing money,\" adds Schneider. Lauren Nechochea, chair of the Idaho Democrats, told ABC News her chapter now has steady, monthly financial support.",
      "Texas Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Lone Star State House Democratic caucus, said Jefferies and Martin gave his cohort full support to break quorum and attempt to block Republican redistricting efforts, a move that kicked off the party's more aggressive opposition to redistricting nationwide.",
      "Wu acknowledges that the perception of the Democratic Party is in peril, and is anxious for politicians to openly fight for the working class. He says voters, friends see Democrats as message-less, scolding hall monitors.",
      "\"People who would rather be right than win; people who would rather spend the time to tell other people how they're wrong instead of telling people what they would do about it and how they're going to fix it,\" Wu told ABC News.",
      "Wu said candidates need to be firmer on their beliefs, and his party must run candidates willing to take Republicans to task (like California's Gov. Newsom in his push to draw Democratic friendly maps) or face total failure.",
      "\"I think that the reality of where we are today and what the cost of failure will mean, I don't think people are under any illusion of where we are at this moment,\" said Wu, who added, \"this is not time for us to screw around ... I don't give a crap that you think Democrats are wimpy or whatever else. But if you want America to not suck anymore, you better join us.\"",

      "Their efforts came as President Donald Trump's political operation also invests millions in voter turnout for New Jersey and Virginia's gubernatorial races, in an effort to boost the Republican candidates on those tickets.",
      "Speaking at a rally for Democratic candidate and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday afternoon, Obama told a crowd of thousands, \"Our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now... Every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.\"",
      "Obama hit Trump on his handling of the economy, and the effect that the administration's layoff efforts had on Virginia, a state home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",
      "\"The economy has been really good for some of Trump's billionaire pals and for finance bros and well-connected corporations who've seen their tax bills go down and don't have to worry about all these pesky regulators anymore. ... Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, including a lot of people here in Virginia, have lost their jobs to pay for those billionaire tax cuts,\" Obama said.",
      "In her remarks, Spanberger sought to link her opponent -- current Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears -- to Trump.",
      "\"We do not need someone who has been in lockstep with this administration every step of the way,\" Spanberger said. Earle-Sears has not campaigned with Trump and has received only a verbal endorsement from the president.",
      "Obama later joined New Jersey Democratic candidate for governor U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill for a campaign rally in Newark on Saturday evening. He delivered similar remarks about Trump, Republicans and the state of the economy under the Trump administration.",
      "Obama's remarks diverged when praising Sherrill for her qualifications, telling the crowd that Sherrill is \"the kind of leader who understands the mission, who knows who she is supposed to serve, who doesn't have a lot of time for excuses. And that is exactly what New Jersey needs right now.\"",
      "Obama also took the time to link Sherrill's opponent in the race, Republican candidate and former state assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, to Trump. Ciattarelli has spoken in support of Trump but has also said he'd be willing to bring up differences with the president if needed.",
      "\"Donald Trump called Mikie's opponent '100% MAGA.' Not a great endorsement. When he was asked to give the Trump administration a grade, Mikie's opponent said they deserved an A,\" Obama said.",

    "summary": "Mamdani addressed recent remarks by his opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Vice President JD Vance.",
    "story": [
      "Mamdani sat down with ABC News' Linsey Davis on Monday.",
      "Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani said he would be a leader for \"every New Yorker\" and try not to \"pit people against each other,\" during a wide-ranging interview with \"ABC News Live Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis in the last stretch of the election.",
      "At the top of Monday's sit-down interview, Mamdani, 34, addressed what he has called anti-Islamic comments made to attack his campaign, following controversial statements made by one of his opponents, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "\"This is a former governor who went on a radio show. The radio show host said that if there was another 9/11, I would be cheering it. Andrew Cuomo laughed and agreed. And it's been a number of days since then, and he's yet to apologize,\" Mamdani said. \"That's not my description of his remarks as being Islamophobic. That is what those remarks are.\"",
      "Mamdani also responded to \"shocking\" remarks by Vice President JD Vance after the mayoral candidate said his aunt felt uncomfortable riding the subway wearing her hijab after 9/11. In response to Mamdani's comments, Vance said on social media: \"According to Zohran the real victim of 9/11 was his auntie who got some (allegedly) bad looks.\"",
      "\"It is sadly unsurprising, but still shocking to see the vice president of this country try and make a cheap joke about Islamophobia when what New Yorkers want is a vision of a city that can come together,\" Mamdani said of Vance's remarks. \"And coming together means honoring every single person who calls this city their home, not trying to pit people against each other as has become the norm in both Republican politics and now we're also seeing in Democratic politics as well.\"",
      "On concerns about his candidacy from some Jewish leaders, after more than 1,000 rabbis from across the country signed a letter decrying his rhetoric on Israel, Mamdani said he has \"appreciated\" conversations he has had with rabbis and Jewish leaders in the five boroughs.",
      "\"Those are conversations that have not only informed my understanding of what it means to root out antisemitism across the city, which we must do, but also the many different ways that we have to do it,\" he said, mentioning actions such as increasing funding for hate crime prevention and implementing a curriculum that \"celebrates the breadth and the beauty of Jewish life in the history of this city.\"",
      "\"I'm looking forward to being the mayor for every New Yorker, for every Jewish New Yorker, and not just those who actually vote for me, but anyone who calls the city home,\" he said.",
      "Days before early voting kicked off in New York City, Mamdani received an endorsement from one top Democrat -- House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. -- and has yet to be endorsed by the other -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "Asked what he makes of that, Mamdani said he appreciates Jeffries' support and that the two discussed affordability in particular.",
      "\"I also say all of this knowing that the reason I sit in a chair across from you now as the Democratic nominee is not because of the number of endorsements that I've received, but because of the movement that we've built -- 90,000 New Yorkers who've been knocking on doors, making phone calls,\" Mamdani said. \"Those are the people who've built this campaign. Those are the people who will take us across the finish line.\"",
      "Among Mamdani's affordability promises are free public buses, an increase in free childcare and frozen rents for rent-stabilized units.",

Both tax changes would need approval from state leaders, though New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has been clear that she does not intend to raise taxes on New Yorkers.",
      "Asked how he would fund his proposals if he isn't able to increase taxes, Mamdani said he would continue to push for the hikes -- which he argued would help \"Trump-proof\" New York City, following threats from President Donald Trump to take away federal funding from the city if the assemblyman, whom Trump has called a \"radical\" and \"communist,\" wins.",
      "\"I will continue to make the case as to why I think we need to increase taxes on the top 1% by 2%, why we need to raise the state's top corporate tax rate to match that of New Jersey, and in doing so, this would raise $9 billion. And that more than pays for our economic agenda and starts to actually 'Trump-proof' our city,\" he said. \"And I will make that case because I think it makes the most sense in the wealthiest city and the wealthiest country in the history of the world that we actually ensure we have the funding necessary to make it a place that New Yorkers can afford.\"",
      "Asked what the biggest misconception is about him, Mamdani said he thinks it's that his affordability platform isn't for all New Yorkers.",
      "\"There is, at times, a misconception about me and also in our politics that I'm only speaking to a certain set of New Yorkers when I'm speaking about that. That I'm only talking to tenants, for example, and not homeowners, that I'm only speaking to New Yorkers who live in this neighborhood as opposed to that one,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the affordability agenda, for it to have a real, true meaning, it has to be universally applied. It means both at once freezing the rent for rent-stabilized tenants and taking on a broken property tax system. It means at the same time that we are talking about how we make buses fast and free, that we are also looking to help those New Yorkers who don't take the bus, right?\"\u00a0Mamadani said.",
      "\"This is a universal application of our politics because too often what politics is characterized by are leaders who are looking only to serve those who already agree with them. I'm looking to serve everyone who calls the city home,\" he added.",

      "Chesley died Sunday at a long-term care facility in Cincinnati, according to his son, Richard Chesley. He did not provide the cause of death.",
      "Chesley came into prominence after winning $50 million for victims of an electrical fire in 1975 at the Beverly Hills Supper Club in Kentucky that killed 165 people. Aside from suing the nightclub, he also took on the aluminum electrical wire industry, an unprecedented approach at the time.",
      "Once among the nation's most powerful trial attorneys, he helped hammer out the $206 billion national tobacco settlement in 1998 and also won settlements against the Catholic Church over alleged sexual abuse.",

      "The man whose mistaken deportation galvanized opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies is charged in federal court in Tennessee with human smuggling",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies, has hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday in the human smuggling case against him in Tennessee.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence.",
      "Here's what to know about the latest developments in the case:",
      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.",
      "While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.",
      "Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump's Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.",
      "Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.",
      "The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of \u201cselective or vindictive prosecution.\u201d",
      "In a recent ruling, Crenshaw found \u201csome evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive\" and said many statements by Trump administration officials \u201craise cause for concern.\" Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, on a Fox News Channel program, that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.",

      "Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire has argued in court filings that it doesn't matter what members of the Trump administration have said about Abrego Garcia.",
      "\u201cThe relevant prosecutorial decision-maker, the Acting U.S. Attorney, has explained on the record that this prosecution was not brought for vindictive or discriminatory reasons,\u201d McGuire writes in a court filing. He adds that any public statements by senior Trump administration officials about Abrego Garcia reflect public safety concerns that are \"plainly consistent with a legitimate motivation to prosecute him.\u201d",
      "Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.",
      "In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.",
      "Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane \u201cconsistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.\u201d And the trooper, they said, had \"no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia currently can't be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.",
      "The administration\u2019s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.",
      "Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.",

      "The shooting happened at around 12:15 a.m. in Bath Township, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of Akron.",
      "At a Sunday morning news conference, Police Chief Vito Sinopoli said the seriousness of the victims' injuries was not clear. It also was not immediately clear if all nine people were shot \u2014 one person's leg injury may have been caused by a fall, he said.",
      "Sinopoli said the large home had been rented out on Airbnb, which is not allowed under local zoning ordinances, and most of the people at the party were under 18. He said the victims may include a mix of juveniles and adults. Social media posts about the party drew a big crowd, he said.",
      "It was not immediately known what sparked the shooting and how many people fired guns, he said. No arrests were announced.",
      "\u201cThe Bath Township community experienced a tragic and senseless act of violence early this morning,\" Sinopoli said.",
      "Airbnb said in a statement Sunday that it prohibits \u201cunauthorized and disruptive gatherings,\" and it has suspended the property listing and removed the account of the person who rented the home. It said it has seen a 50% decrease in the rate of reported parties since 2020, when it put into effect a global party ban policy.",

      "Willy Hilaire is homeless, unemployed and 63. He lives in a New York shelter with his two grandchildren and often goes hungry so that they can eat the food he gets from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "On many days, Hilaire\u2019s only food is a hot meal he gets from Holy Apostles in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. With SNAP at risk, he worries there won't be enough for him and the children, forcing more sacrifice.",

      "Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation\u2019s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown. But officials said it was too late to stop recipients from losing benefits on Saturday and that restoring them could likely take at least one week.",
      "One in eight Americans use SNAP but its halt will disproportionately hurt Black Americans like Hilaire. Black people are 12.6% of the population but more than a quarter of SNAP recipients, the largest overrepresentation of any ethnic or racial group.. Other racial groups get SNAP at rates lower than their overall share of the population.",
      "Historians and advocates say that's an example of what's known as systemic racism. There may be no formally racist policy at play but America\u2019s long history of racism \u2014 from slavery to unfair zoning rules \u2014 has left Black communities with a series of structural disadvantages, and far less wealth accumulated over generations.",
      "Non-Hispanic white people are 58.1% of the population but just 35.4% of SNAP recipients, the latest data show.",
      "Hispanic people and Asian people are underrepresented in the SNAP statistics. And Native Americans get SNAP at basically the same rate that their group is in the general population.",
      "Asian Americans living in poverty face constraints like lack of English fluency and neighborhood gentrification. In New York City, 253,000 of the 1.5 million Asian residents use SNAP, according to the nonprofit Asian American Federation. Over 91% of them work. But, with limited English proficiency, many are limited in their job opportunities, said CEO Catherine Chen. Families who have lived comfortably in cultural enclaves like Chinatown for one or two generations are getting priced out.",
      "A majority of adult SNAP recipients who can work, do. Some still qualify for SNAP \u2014 typically $187 a month \u2014 despite holding down one or more jobs, according to nonprofit advocates. They\u2019re often low-wage jobs without benefits like paid sick days.",
      "A report by the National Urban League last year found that the racial income gap has been virtually unchanged for more than 20 years, with Black Americans making 64% of the income of white people, on average.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much discrimination in the work force, so much discrimination in America today, that Black people who were enslaved and segregated for 350 years are still fighting for economic parity,\u201d said Marc Morial, president of the civil rights group. \u201cWhile we have a growing number of African American, middle-class Americans, we still have a disproportionate number of poor (Black) Americans.\u201d",

Black homeownership fell to the lowest level in four years, according to an analysis by the real estate brokerage Redfin. The Census Bureau found the median Black household income fell 3.3% last year to $56,020. That\u2019s around $36,000 less than what a white household earns.",
      "The looming absence of grocery dollars would almost certainly make it harder for families to afford rent, gas and other expenses. Even if SNAP benefits are restored before November ends, nonprofit leaders say low-income residents could face financial setbacks into next year.",

      "However, those rights continue to be chronically underfunded and uniquely vulnerable to government shutdowns, according to a report released last week by the Brookings Institution. The study found that in 2024, more than two-thirds of trust and treaty responsibilities were funded through discretionary spending, meaning they are not guaranteed during a shutdown. It also noted that one of the largest sources of mandatory spending owed to tribes comes in the form of SNAP benefits.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump sees tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will.",
      "He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda, but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term.",
      "He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil\u2019s case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad.",
      "This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on.",
      "Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history.",
      "He has said it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place.",
      "Trump had said he wanted to take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person, but on Sunday said he had ruled it out, saying he didn't want to be a distraction. \u201cI wanted to go so badly \u2014 I just don\u2019t want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",
      "The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president.",
      "Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs \u2014 a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations.",
      "The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related \u2014 and unrelated -- to trade.",
      "\u201cThe fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump trade team is working on contingency plans should the high court rule against the Republican administration.",
      "\u201cWe do have backup plans,\u201d Leavitt said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\" \u201cBut ultimately\u2026we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what\u2019s right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The president must have the emergency authority to utilize tariffs.\u201d",
      "Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council.",
      "There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates.",
      "Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.",

      "Trump\u2019s tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America\u2019s friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade.",

      "\u201cThe use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like \u2014 just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,\u201d said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank.",
      "But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a \u201cdecent chance\u201d the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president \u201cbroad, flexible emergency powers.\u201d",
      "The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump\u2019s wide-ranging use of executive powers.",
      "If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities.",
      "The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said.",
      "\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t take tariffs off the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes them a little bit slower.\u201d",

      "Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes.",
      "With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week.",
      "The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.",
      "\u201cThe impact, even if it\u2019s temporary, on many of the nation\u2019s poor families is going to be profound if we don\u2019t solve this problem,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes.",
      "\u201cThese are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t point to a similar time in recent history where we\u2019ve had this.\u201d",
      "LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.",
      "States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data.",
      "While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet.",
      "Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.",
      "Minnesota\u2019s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state\u2019s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients\u2019 heating bills until the shutdown ends.",

      "Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves.",
      "\u201cThe situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,\u201d said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has visited Vietnam to reaffirm a partnership focused on addressing the legacies of the Vietnam War",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was in Vietnam on Sunday, reaffirming a partnership built on healing the scars of the Vietnam War in a trip that will test whether Washington can reassure a vital but wary partner.",
      "Hegseth said addressing the legacies of the war, which ended 50 years ago in April, remains the foundation and a top priority of the countries' defense relationship.",
      "At the end of his talks with Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang, Hegseth handed over a leather box, a belt and a small knife \u2014 wartime artifacts once taken by U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War.",
      "Such returns have become part of broader reconciliation efforts between the two countries, with similar relics \u2014 including letters, identification tags and photographs \u2014 handed back to the U.S. in recent years.",
      "\u201cToday we will exchange artifacts and information from the war with the goal of helping family members in both countries find peace,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s visit also marks 30 years of diplomatic ties between the former foes and two years since they upgraded relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, Vietnam\u2019s highest diplomatic status. He arrived in Hanoi from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he attended a meeting of counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.",
      "Cooperation on postwar issues remains key to U.S.-Vietnam relations. Since normalizing ties in 1995, the two countries have worked together to clear unexploded ordnance, recover remains of missing service members and clean up dioxin \u2014 the toxic chemical used in Agent Orange \u2014 from former U.S. air bases that continue to affect communities.",
      "There were concerns about the future of these efforts when U.S. funding for several programs was slashed, temporarily halting some cleanup work before resuming.",
      "The visible recommitment to these projects could help stabilize relations and \u201ccreate space\u201d for further defense cooperation, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute.",

      "The nation\u2019s largest police fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks is set to begin patrolling the streets of Las Vegas in November",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The nation's largest police fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks is set to begin patrolling the streets of Las Vegas in November thanks to a donation from a U.S. tech billionaire, raising concerns about the blurring of lines between public and private interests.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the future of policing,\u201d Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said during a recent press conference, surrounded by the Cybertrucks while drones hovered overhead and a police helicopter circled above him.",
      "The fleet of 10 black-and-white Cybertrucks of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department with flashing lights and sirens are wrapped with the police department\u2019s logo. About 400 officers have been trained to operate the trucks that will use public charging stations.",
      "The all-electric vehicles are equipped with shotguns, shields and ladders and additional battery capacity to better handle the demands of a police department, McMahill said.",
      "The donation has raised concerns from government oversight experts about private donors\u2019 influence on public departments and the boost to the Tesla brand. The department is the latest U.S. city to turn to Tesla models even as Elon Musk \u2019s electric vehicle company has faced blowback because of his work earlier in the year to advance the president\u2019s political agenda and downsize the federal government.",
      "McMahill noted the trucks will help keep officers safer because they are bulletproof, while Metro\u2019s other squad cars are not. Each Cybertruck is valued at somewhere between $80,000 and $115,000 and will be used to respond to calls like barricades and shootings in addition to regular patrols.",
      "The Cybertrucks also offer unique benefits such as a shorter turn radius, he said.",
      "\u201cThey look a little bit different than the patrol cars that we have out there, but they represent something far bigger than just a police car,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThey represent innovation. They represent sustainability, and they represent our continued commitment to serve this community with the best tools that we have available, safely, efficiently and responsibly.\u201d",
      "The fleet comes amid a roller coaster year for Tesla that has dealt with multiple recalls.",
      "In March, U.S. safety regulators recalled virtually all Cybertrucks on the road.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s recall, which covered more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right side of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. Tesla offered to replace the panels free of charge in notification letters sent out in May.",
      "In late October, Tesla announced another recall of more than 63,000 Cybertrucks in the U.S. because the front lights are too bright, which may cause a distraction to other drivers and increase the risk of a collision.",
      "Las Vegas officer Robert Wicks with the department\u2019s public information office said all of Tesla\u2019s recalls will have been dealt with before the Cybertrucks patrol the streets. The March recall regarding panel issues was handled before the department received the trucks, he said.",
      "Federal regulators also have opened yet another investigation into Tesla\u2019s self-driving feature after dozens of incidents in which the cars ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "The Cybertrucks modified for the Las Vegas police fleet do not have any kind of self-driving feature.",
      "Laura Martin, executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund, said the imposing trucks with their sharp angles \u201cseems like they\u2019re designed for intimidation and not safety.\"",

      "In this case, the donation is a physical piece of equipment, and the money can\u2019t be diverted to something else, Obayashi said. That said, he doesn\u2019t think the trucks provide the department with a specific advantage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be really any distinct or noticeable advantage or benefits, so to speak, other than the fact that it\u2019s a free vehicle and it saves the taxpayers money to replace equipment,\u201d Obayashi said.",

      "In the New York borough of the Bronx, about 200 more people than usual showed up at the World of Life Christian Fellowship International pantry, many bundled in winter hats and coats and pushing collapsible shopping carts as they waited in a line that spanned multiple city blocks. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches.",

    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 11:42:02 -0500",
    "summary": "In his latest film, George Clooney plays a familiar role \u2013 one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 who nonetheless tries to reconcile professional success and his personal shortcomings.",
    "story": [
      "Venice can feel like a movie set, particularly when riding on a boat down the Grand Canal with George Clooney.",
      "Waving to fans, he's asked if that ever gets normal. \"No,\" he replied.",
      "Clooney has practice navigating this kind of attention. He's made about 50 films, picking up a couple of Academy Awards along the way (as an actor for \"Syriana,\" and as a producer for \"Argo\"). And for his latest, \"Jay Kelly,\" he plays one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 a familiar role.",
      "He says it's true that he said yes to the film within 24 hours. \"Well, I read it, and I was like, Well, if I take time to think of it, they might go get Brad. And I can't have that. I can't have that, man! When you read something, you know.\"",
      "Co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, the Netflix film \u2013 part comedy, part drama \u2013 critiques the cult of celebrity, as Clooney's character embarks on a journey to reconcile his professional success and personal failings.",
      "I asked, \"There's this kind of mind-bending experience where you're watching the film and you're wondering how much is the character and how much is George Clooney. Did you feel that making it?\"",
      "\"I really didn't,\" Clooney said. \"You know, what I know in life is you can live with failure. I tried this, it didn't work out. What you can't live with is regret. Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",
      "\"I mean, there's things that we would laugh about, you know, playing a guy who no one says 'no' to.\"",
      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",
      "\"Well, I designed it so that that's not the case.\"",
      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salman-rushdie-on-the-eleventh-hour-and-free-speech/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

      "K\u014cRERO: THE PAST IS THE FUTURE",
      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "You are eighteen years old. Cast out by your father, shunned by society, you have fled to Geneva with your lover and your sister. The closeness of their relationship makes you furious, but if you protest, your lover will abandon you. Confined by terrible storms, you find yourself in a house with your lover, your sister and Lord Byron, an infamous and magnetically attractive poet. You know he is dangerous, but you find yourself drawn to him. When he sets a challenge to write a ghost story, all the turmoil that has boiled within you finds a voice.",
      "The anger pours from your pen in a roar of rage. Even as the monster that emerges terrifies you, you understand that it belongs to you. This creature that crawls across the page is the woman you were always meant to be. And in Byron, this furious beast that you have kept hidden for so long may have found a mate. You are eighteen years old. The creature you have created will howl its way onto page and stage and screen, burning its path across history in its desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved. The monster will never be silenced. Neither will you.",
      "Prologue",
      "Geneva, 1816",
      "At dusk, the sky over Lake Geneva is the colour of blood in a glass of water. The ash fragments falling over the city form a strange fog \u2013 a thickening of the air, which swirls through the deserted streets, past the spire of the old cathedral and over the walls of the new Protestant church. Inside, people are on their knees, praying for the uncanny cloud to lift. It is a judgement, they fear, a punishment from God, or else a curse.",
      "This night, like so many before it, the choking dust has driven the residents of the city into the shelter of shuttered houses and places of prayer. Outside, there is no one to witness the way the ash gleams as it settles on the lake. The water flickers and shimmers, each tiny filament glowing like a candle, sinking into the silence, quickly snuffed out.",
      "The lake is chill and dark and deep \u2013 not even the fishermen have fathomed its depths, or the small children who, on any other evening, would be taking turns to dive beneath the surface, competing to see who could swim down the furthest, stay under the longest.",
      "No one is standing on the lake's stony shores to watch the water's surface glow, red as the strange sky above. No one is there to see the darkness beneath the water shift and stir and coalesce, parting for a breath, like two slick thighs, which fall back into the darkness with a gasp that is almost human.",
      "Above, half masked by cloud, a thin slash of moon hangs hazy and indifferent. A lone figure stumbles down to the lake and scrambles into a small rowboat that one of the fishermen has left bobbing at the end of a long line. Looking right, then left, the man leans forward over the rope. Flash of steel from the blade in his hand. A quick tug and the boat is free. The man settles himself on the rocking boards, tugging the oars. No one will see him on this cloud-deadened, mist-muffled night. No one will stop him. Still, his breath stutters and stumbles. He must be quick. His hands ache, his chest burns. His eyes feel gritty as the mist parts before him, then closes around him, giving him the strange sensation of being swallowed.",

      "A National Book Award finalist, Megha Majumdar's \"A Guardian and a Thief\"\u00a0(Knopf) is set in India in a climate-ravaged near-future, in which mother preparing to move her family to America awakens to discover that a starving young man has stolen all\u00a0their passports \u2014 plunging her into seven days of desperation and moral reckoning.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"A Guardian and a Thief\" by Megha Majumdar",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "From the storeroom hidden under the stairs, Ma fetched a cup of rice and a sack of eggs speckled gray like the moon, then cooked, standing before the stove's blue fire, her eye upon the window and its dusk, in which bats swooped and the neem tree shivered and a figure down on the road pedaled a bicycle, whistling, as if everything was all right.",
      "Thief, thought Ma. Who else but a person who had chanced upon fresh vegetables or fruit would wander the city of Kolkata in this ruined year, the heat a hand clamped upon the mouth, the sun a pistol against one's head, and recall a song? She watched to see what the thief would do. He pedaled past. But Ma saw a different reality shimmer into being, in which he leaned his bicycle against the wall, climbed the pipes like a toddy tapper, and appeared at her window. In that picture, the thief was a collector of local information, dutiful in his neighborhood eavesdropping, shrewd in following what he heard about the bins of onions and carrots, the sacks of lentils and rice, the bags of raisins and cashews hidden in the dark fist of the house, stolen by Ma from donations made to the shelter where she worked, while the city outside wept for a handful of something to eat.",
      "There was \u2014 in the label accepted by the region \u2014 a shortage.",
      "In the year prior to this day, farmers across the region had fallen, their bodies running fevers in air that no longer cooled. In the croplands, among stilled machines, pests had traveled from acre to new acre, savage in their feeding of grains. In the west a drought had cleaved riverbeds and in the east salt water had tainted the paddy fields. In the city, those who walked to the neighborhood markets with umbrellas in their hands and wishful lists in their pockets, broad corners torn from the newspaper with writing in Bengali \u2014 cabbage, ginger, lychees if they were good, ice cream, half loaf of bread \u2014 found the roads alongside which the markets usually sat, its baskets and tarps invading, rickshaws and cars sounding their horns, slow shoppers inspecting the purple shine of eggplant and pressing guavas hard as hail, instead completely empty, nothing but some onion peel scattered at the edges where the pavement gave way to earth, where on most days goats and cows might have nudged the soil for something to eat. But those animals were gone too.",
      "It had happened before. 1770, when crops failed and smallpox plagued the enfeebled. 1876, when drought struck the Deccan Plateau and the British continued to export what grain remained. 1943. Those black-and-white newspaper photos, in which people appeared as sunken eyes and twig-thin limbs, facing a photographer who could do nothing for them, their fullness \u2014 their love, their humor, their annoyance, their preference \u2014 pared by the lens to reveal what remained, which was hunger.",

      "Five people have been federally charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of actor Robert De Niro's grandson\u00a0and two others, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The five men, all in their 20s, are charged in connection with the the overdose deaths of three 19-year-olds in 2023, including Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez, Akira Stein, daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein, and an unnamed victim, according to a news release from the Drug Enforcement Administration.",
      "The five suspects were identified as Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver and brothers John Nicolas and Roy Nicolas.",
      "They all face charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl and alprazolam, resulting in the deaths of De Niro-Rodriguez, Stein and the third victim. If convicted as charged, they face a minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.",
      "Epperson was arrested Tuesday in Troy, New York, the DEA said, while McIver was arrested Tuesday in Houston, Texas. John Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Buffalo, New York, while Roy Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Valley Stream, New York. Barreto surrendered to authorities Wednesday in Manhattan. All five have made their initial court appearances.",
      "De Niro-Rodriguez's mother Drena De Niro previously said he died after being sold pills laced with fentanyl. The medical examiner ruled his death accidental, caused by mix of fentanyl, cocaine and other drugs.",
      "\"Defendants who distributed the drugs, who killed these young 19-year-olds knew that they were deadly,\" Clayton said.",
      "Prosecutors allege the five people arrested used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands of counterfeit prescription opioid pills laced with fentanyl to teens and young adults.",
      "\"Drug trafficking organizations have weaponized social media in a way that allows them to expand their network, make more profits and, unfortunately, get more people addicted to their poison,\" Frank Tarentino, special agent in charge for the DEA's New York Division, said in a news conference Thursday.",
      "One of the victims allegedly warned one of the five suspects arrested that the drugs they had sold her caused her to overdose, and\u00a0 she told him \"just warn customers in batch might be extra strong,\" according to federal court documents. She later died after another overdose, prosecutors said.",
      "The second victim died of an overdose two weeks later, and De Niro-Rodriguez died of an overdose less than a month after that.",
      "De Niro-Rodriguez and his mother appeared in the 2018 movies \"A Star Is Born\" and \"Cabaret Maxime.\" He was also credited with an appearance in 2005's \"The Collection.\"",
      "Drena De Niro speaks out",
      "De Niro-Rodriguez's mother released the following statement Friday:",
      "Leandro De Niro Rodriguez - our Leo - was kind, curious, and full of promise. He was a young man just shy of his 20th birthday, with a bright future ahead of him. We miss him terribly. We know there are thousands of families like ours who understand the nightmare of losing a child or loved one to fentanyl poisoning.",
      "The recent indictments in relation to the wrongful deaths of Victim #1 (whose name has not been made public at this time), Akira Stein, and Leandro De Niro Rodriguez is yet another painful reminder of an epidemic that has risen to plague proportions in the U.S. In 2023, there were 100,000 overdose related deaths. Out of over 2,400 New Yorkers who died of fentanyl-related overdose deaths, approximately 75 of them were teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24.",
      "No parent should have to bury a child. No family should have to endure the suffering of such a senseless and preventable loss.",
      "We are grateful to the law enforcement agencies, including the DEA New York Division and the NYPD as well as many individuals whose work and dedication brought us to this moment. Their efforts mean more than our words can express. Thank you.",
      "We will continue to honor Leo's life and the lives of countless other children and young adults taken too soon, by raising awareness, advocating for change, and working to ensure that other families will never have to experience this kind of heartbreak.",

      "In addition, 19 other people were federally charged with running a drug distribution racket in New York City's Washington Square Park since 2020. The 19 charged have nicknames like \"Scarface,\" \"Butter,\" \"Hollywood\" and \"Heavy,\" prosecutors said, and face charges of conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death.",
      "The indictment alleges they \"maintained a year-round market for opioids and crack cocaine\" in the park, adding the various defendants have been arrested more than 80 times for drug-related crimes and, when they were released, they returned to the park and kept selling drugs.",
      "\"The defendants are aware that their drugs cause overdoses,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Pictures in the indictment reportedly show the scene after two people fatally overdosed on drugs containing fentanyl, allegedly sold to them from dealers in the Washington Square Park area.",
      "The victims included an 18-year-old who had just arrived in the city two days after graduating from high school and a 43-year-old person experiencing homelessness who was found dead on a sidewalk.",

      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

      "Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" one of the most influential rock songs ever recorded, was released 50 years ago.",
      "It broke records and soared to the top of the British charts. It was No. 1 twice in the U.K. and also made history with the first ever promotional rock video.",
      "But in the U.S., the song took 17 more years and being featured in the movie \"Wayne's World\" to turn into a mega hit. Today, it has almost 3 billion streams on Spotify, which is the most for any 20th century song.",
      "\"It changed the dynamics of music\"",
      "The hit song came to life in the Welsh countryside at Rockfield Studios, which was set up in the 1960s by two farmers and musicians, Charles and Kingsley Ward.",
      "Queen's band members \u2014 Freddie Mercury, John Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May \u2014 lived at Rockfield for two weeks in 1975, working on their fourth album, \"A Night at the Opera.\"",
      "\"I don't think anybody realized at the time that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' would end up the iconic record it was,\" said Kingsley Ward, who's now 85 years old.",
      "In the main studio, which is still in use, Queen laid down the song in three sections \u2014 choral, hard rock and opera. The sound was revolutionary, as was the length of the track at almost six minutes.",
      "\"It's probably the greatest record ever made, a rock record, because it changed the dynamics of music, and people now realize they can do anything with music,\" Ward said.",
      "Ward remembers Queen's leader, Mercury, as \"very quiet, unassuming and just a genuinely nice person, wasn't flamboyant at all.\"",
      "He said Mercury kept the band waiting for the song they then knew only as \"Freddy's thing.\"",
      "\"Brian and John were playing frisbee. I remember talking to Brian and saying, 'You've been here a long time, five days, you haven't done much.' And I think Brian said, 'Freddy's in there writing something.'\"",
      "Ward explained Mercury was inside what is now an office and in the corner of the office was an old piano. Out the window, Kingsley said Mercury would have been able to see the old farm wind vane.",
      "\"Now, the odd thing is, a lot of people ask me, 'did Freddy get the idea of that iconic line, 'any way the wind blows,' looking at the weathercock?' We don't know, because Freddy's not here to tell us, but it's a great story, isn't it?\"",

      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the statement said. \"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew had recently said he would stop using his royal titles and honors, including the Duke of York, but Thursday's statement on behalf of King Charles III and Queen Camilla initiated the formal process of revoking all his titles, including prince.",
      "\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement said.",
      "Andrew has come under intense scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from\u00a0Virginia Giuffre\u00a0that she was trafficked to engage in sex with the prince while she was underage. Andrew has denied the allegations. He reached a\u00a0settlement with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,\" the statement said.",
      "Giuffre's family said Thursday in a statement provided to CBS News' partner network BBC News, \"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.\"",
      "\"Today, she declares victory. We, her family, along with her survivor sisters, continue Virginia's battle and will not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" said the statement sent on behalf of her brother, Sky Roberts, and sister-in-law, Amanda.",
      "In a memoir published posthumously, Giuffre detailed her alleged encounters with Andrew.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, [Ghislaine] Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\" (Maxwell was convicted for her role in trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.)",
      "In 2022, Andrew gave up his military affiliations, royal patronages and official public duties. He also stopped using the title \"His Royal Highness.\"",
      "Andrew had faced heavy criticism from the British public over his living arrangements, with many voicing concern that he continued to live in his mansion on a royal estate despite the accusations leveled against him and his retreat from royal duties.",
      "His 75-year lease for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, included an up-front payment of around 8 million pounds (around $10.5 million) and an annual rent described as a \"peppercorn,\" meaning an extremely small amount, according to\u00a0BBC News. Part of that payment was for renovations to the property, which at the time was in a state of disrepair, and Buckingham Palace felt that having Andrew pay the cost to upgrade the property was better than using public funds, BBC reported.",
      "The lease had previously been referred to as \"cast iron,\" and Buckingham Palace said it needed to negotiate with Andrew in order to remove him, but did not provide further information about the details of those negotiations.",
      "Buckingham Palace said Andrew will move out of the residence as soon as possible and will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, located about 100 miles north of London.",

      "In widely expected job cuts after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount has begun layoffs set to impact about 2,000 employees.",
      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",
      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",
      "It's not uncommon for businesses to initiate layoffs following a merger. When Skydance completed its purchase of Paramount, the combined company said it would look for \"opportunities to streamline its business.\" Paramount is also rumored to have interest in buying Warner Bros. Discovery, the home of HBO, CNN and DC Studios, among other brands.",
      "Neither Paramount nor Warner has publicly confirmed talks. But Warner earlier this month signaled that it may be open to selling all or parts of its business\u00a0in light of \"unsolicited interest\" it said it had received from multiple parties.

      "\"When I first got there, I felt socially pushed away,\" he said. \"Because it is like the whitest show in the world and I didn't want no one to portray me in a way that wasn't true. It was like I had the whole Black community on my back.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",

    "story": [
      "Travelers heading to airports this week may face more flight disruptions as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck late last month and with the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on the cusp of becoming the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Almost 6,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, Nov. 2, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "The shutdown on Tuesday is set to become the longest in history, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse. In the meantime, air traffic controllers and workers for the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 both considered essential workers \u2014 are required to show up at their jobs even though their pay is halted until lawmakers agree on a new deal to fund the federal government.",
      "The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more likely it is to cause flight delays and snarls at security checkpoints, Katy Nastro, a travel expert at Going.com, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",
      "Some Houston travelers faced waits of about an hour to get through airport security lines this weekend, according to CBS affiliate KHOU. Only two out of five security checkpoints are open at Houston's Bush airport, the station noted, while the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported\u00a0that some people faced waits of three hours to get through the airport's security.",
      "Thanksgiving outlook for air travel",
      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",
      "Still, experts said that air safety isn't an issue, given that the FAA will slow flights if there aren't enough air traffic controllers directing flights. That was reiterated by Duffy on Sunday, who told \"Face the Nation\" that the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him \u2014 everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.",
      "In his gray three\u2011piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass\u2011domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty\u2011three\u2011foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.",
      "It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?",
      "As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth\u2011century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream\u2011white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.",
      "The athletic fifty\u2011two\u2011year\u2011old bank chairman \u2014 an unusually optimistic man whom the press called \"Sunshine Charlie\" \u2014 had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self\u2011consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.",
      "Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.",
      "But he didn't have time to consider his emotional state.",
      "He walked upstairs to confer with Hugh Baker, who ran National City's stock\u2011trading unit.",
      "Baker, a tall, bald man with piercing eyes, began to explain to Mitchell, calmly, if somewhat obliquely, what had taken place while Mitchell had been at the Federal Reserve.",
      "\"Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,\" Baker told him.",
      "Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.",
      "Baker finally blurted out: \"We purchased seventy\u2011odd thousand shares.\"",
      "Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged \u2014 and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.",
      "Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.",
      "But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big \u2014 and risky \u2014 bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month \u2014 because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.",
      "So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.",
      "In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy\u2011one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.",
      "\"With that news,\" he told Baker, \"I could be knocked over with a feather.\"",
      "There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy\u2011one thousand shares \u2014 which cost about $32 million \u2014 were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.",
      "\"It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,\" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers \u2014 traders who bet that stocks would go down \u2014 were lining up targets, probing for weakness.",
      "The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.",
      "What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately \u2014 known as \"off\u2011exchange,\" which was the case with National City shares \u2014 were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.",
      "Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop. If prices declined fast enough, it could trigger a much larger crisis: A \"lack of confidence might bring a run,\" Mitchell told Baker, envisioning depositors lining up outside every one of its fifty\u2011eight branches around the country.",
      "A run on the country's largest bank. There was nothing bankers feared more.",

    "story": [
      "Selling for nearly $1,000 a cup, a cafe in Dubai is offering the world's most expensive coffee, brewed from Panamanian beans sold at a premium price.",
      "The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures, including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world's tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.",
      "\"The wait is finally over,\" Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering,\u00a0said in a Facebook video. \"The world's most celebrated and highest graded coffee of all time has arrived at Julith.\"",
      "Located in an industrial neighborhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve \"around 400 cups\" of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.",
      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",
      "\"There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavors like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,\" said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.",
      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",
      "Dubai notched a Guinness World Record for the world's most expensive cup of coffee last month, when Roasters offered one for 2,500 dirhams.",
      "The new record staggered some people, though residents also said it was par for the course for the desert city with a luxury lifestyle.",
      "\"It's very shocking but at the same time, it's Dubai,\" said Ines, who did not give her last name.",
      "\"For wealthy people, it's just another experience they can boast about,\" added another resident, Maeva.",
      "The Julith cafe bought its beans at an auction in Panama after a tough battle that lasted many hours and drew hundreds of bids.",
      "It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.",
      "Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.",
      "Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the \"Nido 7 Geisha\" beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama's Baru volcano.",
      "But the cafe said it does not plan to share its treasure, beyond a small amount reserved for Dubai's ruling family.",
      "Coffee prices surging in U.S.",
      "The pricey cup of coffee is being offered as the cost of roasted coffee has jumped 18.9% in the U.S., according to the most recent Consumer Price Index data for September.",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 07:43:48 -0400",
    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",

      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month.

      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 18:19:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

      "Powder supplements sold at Sam's Club stores are linked to at least 11 cases of Salmonella in seven states, federal health authorities said Friday.",
      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,\" the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.",
      "Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.",
      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. State health officials in Virginia and Michigan collected and tested samples of the product from the homes of people who fell ill.",
      "The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues.",
      "Moringa is a plant native to India and other countries prized for essential nutrients including protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, according to research published by the National Institutes of Health. Its leaves can be dried and powdered.",
      "People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms.",

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500\u00a0workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

The only way to protect her money was to convert the funds into bitcoin, the person told Reynolds.",
      "She withdrew her entire bank account balance, which totaled $13,100, and followed the scammer's directions to go to a bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 such terminals across the U.S.",

      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",

      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:24:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",

      "Disney networks including ABC and ESPN have gone dark on Google-owned YouTube TV after the two corporate giants couldn't come to terms on a new deal. And the two sides wasted no time pointing fingers.",
      "A post on the YouTube blog says, \"Last week, Disney used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers. They're now following through on that threat, suspending their content on YouTube TV. This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.",
      "\"We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers and we continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV.\"",
      "But a Disney spokesperson said in a statement that, \"Unfortunately, Google's YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC. Without a new agreement in place, their subscribers will not have access to our programming.",
      "\" ... Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor. We know how frustrating this is for YouTube TV subscribers and remain committed to working toward a resolution as quickly as possible.\"",
      "YouTube did say that if Disney content stays off YouTubeTV for \"an extended period,\" YouTube would offer subscribers a $20 credit.",

    "story": [
      "Some federal workers going unpaid during the U.S. government shutdown are resorting to taking out bank loans to tide them over financially.",
      "A San Antonio, Texas, woman whose husband works for the Department of Defense, told CBS News her family\u00a0is relying on a no-interest loan from the United Services Automobile Association (USAA) to pay the bills while he is furloughed.",
      "The woman, who did not want to be named because of concerns about sharing private financial matters, told CBS News the family took out a $3,200 loan from USAA earlier this month, saying that \"we would have been in trouble\" without the money.",
      "Her predicament highlights the financial challenges many government workers are facing as the stalemate in Congress, now on Day 30, continues. She said that one of her five children, who has special needs, underwent spinal fusion surgery earlier this year. Their health plan covered most, but not all, of the procedure's costs, saddling them with medical bills that are now coming due.",
      "\"Insurance took some time to process it all, and things are starting to come in at a really bad time,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Since the shutdown began on October 1, USAA has issued more than $365 million in special loans to over 119,000 federal employees affected by the government shutdown.",
      "\"These are unique, zero-interest, zero-fee loans built specifically to help people meet their essentials during this crisis,\" USAA certified financial planner JJ Montanaro told CBS News.",
      "USAA members can apply for a no-interest loan equal to one net paycheck, for up to $6,000, and have 90 days to repay the loan from its date of issuance, according to the San Antonio-based lender. USAA provides banking services to 14 million members of the military, veterans and their families, and has offices in eight cities.",
      "Paycheck replacement",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal workers missed their first full paychecks\u00a0on Oct. 24, and last received partial paychecks on Oct. 10. Furloughed workers, as well as essential government employees required to work without pay during the shutdown,\u00a0are entitled to back pay once agencies reopen. It remains unclear when their next payday will come.",
      "Other lenders are also stepping in to help federal workers bridge the financial gap during the impasse in Congress.",
      "Navy Federal Credit Union, which serves military servicepeople, veterans and their families, offers a \"Paycheck Assistance Program\" for members who are going without pay during the shutdown.",
      "The credit union's no-interest loans are issued in the amount of members' regular deposits, also up to $6,000. Once workers receive their paychecks again, the amount of the loan will be deducted as repayment.",
      "During a 2018-2019 government shutdown that lasted a record 35 days, Navy Federal issued a total of $53 million in loans to 32,000 recipients. Anne Repczynski, an assistant vice president at the lender, said member enrollment in the financial assistance program has been \"significantly higher\" during the latest shutdown.",
      "Naomi Pyle, a San Diego resident whose husband is in the Navy, said she applied for a Navy Federal loan to help her family cover bills, including therapy sessions for their son, who has autism, and for the couple's daughter's braces. She is delaying some dental work she requires until the shutdown ends, Pyle added.",
      "Redwood Credit Union, a California-based community lender, said it has issued roughly $160,000 in zero-interest loans to 60 recipients. The bank says it serves about 3,200 federal workers who are eligible for the loans, which they have 60 days to repay.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans earlier this week on the issue, defended the tariffs, telling reporters that \"tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first.\"",
      "\"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country,\" the vice president said. \"They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Then, on Wednesday, the Senate approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, with support from four Republicans.",
      "Thursday's vote also marked the second time the chamber has weighed in on the issue, after the Senate voted in April on a resolution to Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The effort fell short at the time, with two senators who had previously voiced opposition to the tariffs measure absent from the vote.",

    "summary": "With the Treasury Department no longer minting the one-cent coin, some businesses are offering perks to customers who bring in pennies.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses around the U.S. are desperate for pennies.",
      "President Trump's decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is leaving some merchants short of the one-cent coin and struggling to give customers exact change. Unable to order fresh supplies of pennies, banks are also rationing them.",
      "Some retailers are pulling out all the stops just to scrounge up some pennies. Pennsylvania-based grocery chain Giant Eagle is holding a one-day event this weekend where customers can exchange their pennies for gift cards worth double the value of the coins, CBS News Pittsburgh reports.",
      "Sheetz, a convenience store chain, is also running a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\"We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\" Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel.",
      "That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "Costs more than they're worth",
      "To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change.",
      "\"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The penny, which dates from the\u00a0early days of the U.S. Mint\u00a0after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "\"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Piling up in jars",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",
      "Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.",
      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back\"",
      "The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \"decimalization\" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 09:43:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Amazon and UPS on Tuesday announced tens of thousands of job cuts, the latest signal that the U.S. labor market is downshifting.",
    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",

    "summary": "According to the Unidos Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, 53% of Latino voters cite the cost of living and inflation as their leading concern.",
    "story": [
      "A sweeping new survey of 3,000 registered Latino voters across the country finds that economic anxiety continues to dominate the political mood heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with cost of living, jobs, and housing far outpacing other issues as top priorities for the nation's second-largest voting bloc.",
      "The new survey finds that while immigration is still important to this increasingly swing electorate, it's not the top issue. It ranks fifth, behind affordability, jobs and other kitchen table issues.",
      "According to the Unidos Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, first obtained by CBS News, 53% of Latino voters cite the cost of living and inflation as their leading concern, followed by jobs and the economy (36%), housing (32%), health care (30%) and immigration reform (20%). More than one-third say the economy is worse than it was a year ago, while just 14% believe it has improved.",
      "Pocketbook concerns dominate nearly every measure of voter sentiment. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of Latino voters surveyed say President Trump and congressional Republicans are not doing enough to improve the economy \u2014 a 5-point increase since April \u2014 and half of respondents believe Mr. Trump's economic policies will make them personally worse off next year.",
      "The perception of declining economic stability is fueling discontent with Washington: 81% of Latino voters say Congress is failing to fulfill its checks-and-balances role, and 62% disapprove of how the Republican Party is leading Congress. A similar share, 61%, blame Republicans for the recent government shutdown, compared to just 22% who fault Democrats.",
      "\"Hispanic voters keep stressing the need to address low wages and the rising cost of living, yet feel that the administration and Republicans whom they hold most responsible for the shutdown are not focusing enough on this,\" Clarissa Martinez de Castro, vice president of UnidosUS, told CBS News.",
      "\"Making matters worse, Hispanic voters also feel that civil rights and freedoms, and their personal safety or that of their loved ones are at risk. Perhaps that is why an overwhelming 81% are concerned that Congress is giving the president too much authority and power.\"",
      "In the new poll by the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, 64% of Latinos disapprove of Mr. Trump's job performance, with 13% of his 2024 supporters saying they would not vote for him again and another 9% uncertain. The issues most shaping opinions of the president include cost of living and inflation, immigration arrests and deportations, jobs, and cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "For the president, the results mark a sharp contrast with his 2024 performance among Hispanic voters \u2014 a constituency that helped fuel his return to the White House. Now, economic pessimism and disapproval of congressional Republicans could reshape Latino turnout and partisan alignment heading into the next midterm cycle.",
      "If the midterms were held today, 52% of Latinos surveyed say they would vote for the Democratic House candidate, compared to 28% for the Republican \u2014 underscoring a widening partisan gap since 2024, when Mr. Trump carried 48% of Latino voters overall and 54% of Latino men in his successful presidential bid, according to Pew Research.",
      "By and large, Latino voters stand by their 2024 presidential vote choices, however, including those who supported the president a year ago. Asked if they had to do it over again, would they still vote for President Trump or former Vice President Harris, 78% of Trump supporters said they would and 93% of Harris supporters also responded in the affirmative.",
      "\"The fascinating part is that the Democrats haven't really lost Latino voters, but they're not winning them back,\" Daniel Garza from the right-leaning LIBRE initiative said in an interview with CBS in response to the poll. \"We're at this inflection point. And they're waiting for somebody to win them over with something positive, productive that's going to move us forward. And right now, I don't think that Trump is meeting expectations, but Democrats have done nothing. They're worse off, actually.\" Garza described them as \"obstructionists\" in the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "Garza predicts that if the economy improves by the spring under the Trump administration's economic policies, \"Democrats may lose (Latino voters) forever.\"",
      "According to the poll, Latino voters are leaning towards Democrats on a range of issues, with 55% saying the Democratic Party cares \"a great deal\" about the Latino community, compared to just 29% who say the same of Republicans. One in three view the GOP as \"hostile\" to Latinos.",
      "When asked which party they trust most on key policy areas, Democrats hold advantages on several key issues including health care. However, the GOP maintains an edge on border security.",
      "The bipartisan survey  was conducted across the country with over samples of 400 registered Latino voters in Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado, Texas and Georgia.",
      "In California, which is holding a special election on Tuesday to decide on a California ballot measure that would allow state Democrats to redraw several congressional districts to make them more favorable to their party, Latino voter turnout could wield outsized influence on how this contest plays out. California has the largest Latino-eligible electorate. Both sides of the Proposition 50 debate have been appealing to the Hispanic populations. The Democratic National Committee announced earlier this fall a bilingual organizing initiative that targets these potential voters and includes 41,000 volunteers canvassing and phone banking traditionally Latino communities in California.",
      "On the subject of immigration, the survey captures deep unease about civil liberties and public safety: 72% of those surveyed oppose a recent Supreme Court decision allowing immigration agents to use a person's language, appearance and work location as grounds for making a stop, 59% say their rights and liberties feel less secure than before, and about half oppose deploying U.S. troops to cities for crime or immigration enforcement.",
      "The high court froze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in southern California by relying solely on four factors: apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an ascend, being at a specific location like a day laborer pickup site, and a person's occupation. In the survey, 41% of the respondents said they fear they or someone close to them might be arrested by federal immigration agents despite having legal status.",
      "Nearly half (49%) also said they are \"very concerned\" that they or someone close could become a victim of political violence, with 44% blaming the rise in such violence mostly on Republican rhetoric.",
      "The UnidosUS survey was conducted Oct. 8 through Oct. 22 by BSP Research and Shaw & Company Research, the head of which, Daron R. Shaw, serves as part of the polling team for Fox News. BSP Research conducted polls for Democrats in 2024.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. This year, CBS News polling also indicated that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to a CBS News national survey last month, most Latinos rank either the economy/jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially. Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "The 34-year-old Queens assemblyman has proposed policies he says address affordability in the city, like free child care, a rent freeze and free buses.",

    "story": [
      "Election Day 2025 is almost here, with closely watched races in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, as well as a redistricting ballot measure in California \u2014 all of which may be viewed as early bellwethers for next year's midterm elections.",
      "Here are the races to watch Tuesday:",
      "New York City",
      "New York City's highly watched mayoral election is a rare three-person race that has attracted the attention of a former New Yorker, President Trump.",
      "Democrats chose Queens state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani as their nominee in the June primary, a democratic socialist whose campaign on affordability has been embraced by the grassroots. New York City is heavily Democratic, so the winner of the party's primary is generally considered the favorite to win in November. Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who led polls early in the mayoral race.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted on federal corruption charges in September 2024, which were dropped in the early days of the Trump administration, skipped the June Democratic primary, instead opting to be on the ballot as an independent candidate. But facing a lack of funds and polling in the single digits, Adams dropped out in September and later\u00a0threw his support behind Cuomo.",
      "Cuomo has remained in the race, and although he lagged in raising money earlier in the race, his fundraising improved in October after Adams dropped out. Mamdani, meanwhile, has shattered fundraising expectations, with his campaign saying it reached the $8 million spending cap for New York City matching funds in early September.",
      "A trio of polls released on Oct. 30 showed Mamdani with a commanding lead, though others earlier in the week showed an uptick in support for Cuomo. Early voting has substantially risen compared to 2021. Since Oct. 25, more than 730,000 New Yorkers\u00a0have cast their ballots early, compared to the\u00a0nearly 170,000 who cast their ballots early in 2021.",
      "If Mamdani, 34, wins, he will become the second-youngest mayor in New York City history as well as the first Muslim mayor. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 2020 to represent Astoria, Queens \u2014 one of the most progressive parts of New York City. Mamdani said he will ask New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on if he wins. She has not yet said whether she will accept.",
      "Cuomo, who was elected New York governor three times before resigning amid sexual misconduct allegations, has tried to paint Mamdani as an elitist, since his father is a Columbia University professor and his mother is a film director. Cuomo's father, Mario Cuomo, was a three-term governor of New York. Andrew Cuomo has also attacked Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilized apartment, even as Cuomo himself moved to his daughter's apartment in New York City before he ran for mayor.",
      "Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in 2021, is back on the ballot on the GOP line, although some Republicans have called on him to drop out to help Cuomo's candidacy. Mr. Trump has called Sliwa \"not exactly prime time\" and suggested Cuomo would be a better mayor.",
      "All 51 seats of the New York City Council are also on the ballot. There is also a voter initiative on moving local elections to presidential election years.",
      "New Jersey governor",
      "Former GOP New Jersey state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli is making his third run for governor, after losing to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021. He's facing off against Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who's trying to deliver Democrats a third consecutive term in the governor's mansion, a feat that has not been accomplished by either party since the 1970s.",
      "Sherrill, who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, is running as a moderate and trying to tie Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump. But Ciattarelli is promoting his ties to the president, and accused Sherrill in a September debate of blaming Mr. Trump for everything.",
      "Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill are appealing to voters' concerns about the high cost of living: Ciattarelli is touting a \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" pitch, while Sherrill features an \"Affordability Agenda\" on her campaign website.",
      "In September, CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to an ally of Ciattarelli in error. Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's record in the Navy, looking for information about a Naval Academy cheating scandal that implicated over 100 midshipmen. Sherrill was not accused of wrongdoing but did not walk in her graduation, which she said was because she \"didn't turn in some of my classmates.\" Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and, as a midshipman, received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a classmate.",
      "Virginia governor's race",
      "Virginia governors may not run for consecutive terms under state law, so Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is not on the ballot.",
      "Virginia's gubernatorial election is often seen as a potential referendum on the incumbent president. The president's party often loses the Virginia governor's race, which always falls in the year following a presidential election. In recent history, Terry McAuliffe bucked that trend when he won the election in 2013, a year after President Barack Obama's reelection.",
      "The Trump administration's broadsides against the federal workforce hit Virginia hard, since the state has hundreds of thousands of civilian federal employees and thousands of government contractors and active-duty military. Most are going without pay during the government shutdown that's now stretching into its second month.",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race. Either Spanberger or Earle-Sears will make history as the commonwealth's first female governor, and if Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first female Black governor.",
      "One of Youngkin's paths to victory in 2021 was tying McAuliffe, who was running for a non-consecutive term, to unpopular progressive social issues, which Earle-Sears has tried to replicate in the race against Spanberger. But Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer, has run as a centrist and has touted endorsements from the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which backed Youngkin in 2021, as well as former Republican Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman.",
      "Mr. Trump has not endorsed Earle-Sears.",
      "Virginia attorney general",
      "Democrat Jay Jones was leading incumbent Jason Miyares in a Washington Post poll in early October in the Virginia attorney general's race, but before the poll was released, text messages Jones had sent in 2022 resurfaced involving fantasies of violence against Todd Gilbert, who was then the Republican speaker of the House of Delegates.",
      "In a statement to CBS News when the messages resurfaced, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "But Republicans, including the president, have called on Jones to drop out. Miyares has seized on the controversy, running ads saying, \"Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?\"",
      "In a Washington Post poll conducted from Oct. 16-21 \u2014 after the text messages were released \u2014 Jones and Miyares were statistically tied with 46% each.",
      "California's Proposition 50",
      "Proposition 50 would allow California Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. The initiative is their response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, 43 represented by Democrats and nine by Republicans. The five GOP-led districts targeted under Proposition 50 are District 1, represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa; District 3, represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley; District 22, represented by Rep. David Valadao; District 41, represented by Rep. Ken Calvert; and District 48, represented by Rep. Darrell Issa.",
      "A recent CBS News poll found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and oppose national Republicans.",
      "Prop 50, according to the poll, has 62% support among likely voters.",
      "In total, more than $167.9 million has been raised in support of Prop 50 as of Oct. 28, according to the California Secretary of State's office. According to the Secretary of State's office, Top donors supporting Prop 50 include the House Majority PAC for Proposition 50, with $46 million in contributions, and billionaire investor George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform, with $10 million.",

      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report \u2014 they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "\"They don't go and tell you about it,\" continued Mr. Trump. \"You know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They \u2014 they test way under \u2014 underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.",
      "\"You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China \u2014 and China does test, and we're gonna test also.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plans to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",

The 2025 shutdown is a day shy of the record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 35 days and took place during President Trump's first administration.",

There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",

On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",

      "In mid-October, the administration already sent \"reduction in force\" layoff notices to over 4,000 federal employees across seven agencies.",
      "Here are the approximate numbers:",
      "$130 million: The private donation Trump says he's used to help pay the military",
      "President Trump says an unnamed \"patriot\" donated $130 million to fund troops' paychecks, which are normally cut off during shutdowns. The New York Times reported that donor is Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and scion to the Mellon family banking fortune.",
      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it. The GDP will face a sustained drop of $7 billion after a four-week shutdown, $11 billion after six weeks and $14 billion after eight weeks, the CBO says.",
      "This story has been updated to correct the length of the longest previous shutdown; it was 35 days.",

    "summary": "President Trump and both parties are drawing negative ratings for their handling of the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it.",
      "There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes, along with that concern about national impact.",
      "Politically, that means no one is \"winning\" overall: Congressional Democrats, Republicans and President Trump are all drawing increasingly negative marks for their handling of it as it has gone on.",
      "Democrats express more concern over the economic impact than Republicans do.",
      "Other governmental functions, including air travel, also draw concern due to the shutdown.",
      "Most disapprove of how all the players involved are handling it, and those views have become a bit more negative over October, the month when the shutdown began.",
      "Looking within the rank-and-file of each party, both congressional Republicans and Democrats draw majority approval from their respective partisans. But the Republican base is even more solidly approving of its delegation than the Democrats are of their own.",
      "Some of that is related to attention: the Democrats who don't approve or are unsure of their party aren't following news of the shutdown as closely. Another may be financial: Rank-and-file Democrats generally express more concern about the shutdown's effects on the economy and on themselves, and the Democrats who do approve are also a little more likely to call their own financial situation good, so they may think of themselves in a better position to weather any impact.",
      "But overall, Congress isn't perceived as even working to end it.",
      "Continued uncertainty in the economy",
      "Americans are especially sensitive because the economy continues to elicit uncertainty.",
      "Ratings of it have been bad for years \u2014 nothing much has changed there \u2014 and expectations for the coming year remain mixed at best. Support for tariffs remains negative as it has been; views of the job market are also negative \u2014 and there's also continuing concern, amid all the recent news about AI investment and the market, that AI will take jobs.",
      "But perhaps most of all, prices are still seen as rising \u2014 a reminder amid a sea of other measures that it is prices, not the rate of change in inflation, that Americans often perceive most immediately.",
      "Few expect prices to come down in the next few months, either.",
      "Those who expect continued higher prices and have a more negative outlook on the economy are particularly concerned about the economic effects of the shutdown.",
      "Politics, parties and the week ahead",
      "One year on from his election victory, most Americans do perceive Mr. Trump as trying to fulfil his campaign promises, even though many say it's a different approach than they expected \u2014 nor do all approve.",
      "And as we're reminded again this week amid more state elections, politics is about choices, not just evaluations.",
      "On the policy front, Mr. Trump and the Republicans' perceived approaches to both economic and immigration policy are today favored over the Democrats' in a straight-up comparison. (A sizable number don't seem to like either, or aren't sure.)",
      "For context, ahead of this week's races and as we head into a midterm election year, there's always the political question of how much of a factor Donald Trump will be in other contests, and whether Democrats also need to move this needle on perceived policy approach to be competitive.",
      "One item drawing attention this week is the New York mayor's race (which most people nationally say they're following, if not very closely.) We asked Democrats nationwide what they thought their party's economic policies should be as it regards socialism and capitalism \u2014 and most Democrats would see their party have a mix of both, but not more of one exclusively.",
      "And another topic in focus this week will be redistricting, where Californians will vote on a redistricting measure, while debates over redrawing lines take place across multiple states.",
      "The American public is not so keen on all that. Most of them think the lines ought to be left alone until 2030, or that more competitive \u2014 not more gerrymandered \u2014 districts ought to be drawn.",
      "Only a quarter of the public (largely, only the strongest partisans) want more districts one party can win.",
      "Specific issues",
      "Meanwhile all of that economic uncertainty \u2014 and mixed approach \u2014 does continue to take its toll on Mr. Trump's ratings on inflation and the economy, specifically. Those, along with the shutdown, continue to weigh on his overall approval, and all have been ticking down over time to their lows for this term. Inflation, in particular, sees him with two-thirds disapproving.",
      "Mr. Trump does get relatively better, if not positive, marks on immigration. That's been the case for a while, in part, because his GOP is so solidly behind him on the matter, including his deportation program, and in part because Americans overall do say border crossings are down under his administration.",
      "The negotiated peace deal between Israel and Hamas has given Mr. Trump a bump in his approval on handling that conflict. He gets relatively higher approval from independents (and Democrats to some extent)\u00a0 on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict than he does overall.",
      "He gets more positive marks on this than he does overall and on the economy, inflation and immigration, more specifically.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump's approval has ticked down just a point from early October, and remains in the low 40s where it has generally been since mid-summer.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,124 U.S. adults interviewed between October 29-31, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee is challenging a new California law designed to protect Jewish students from discrimination that plaintiff teachers and students say is unconstitutionally vague and violates their free speech rights.",
      "The federal complaint, filed Sunday in San Jose, seeks to invalidate legislation Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last month creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.",
      "The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, doesn't define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Jenin Younes, national legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.",
      "\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.",
      "In the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson says students in his rural, largely Christian school district often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.",
      "Parents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestine and the Middle East.",
      "Students in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. The number is a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The head of the Food and Drug Administration's drug center abruptly resigned Sunday after federal officials began reviewing \"serious concerns about his personal conduct,\" according to a government spokesperson.",
      "Dr. George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of General Counsel were notified of the issues, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email. Tidmarsh then resigned Sunday morning.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,\" Hilliard said.",
      "The departure came the same day that a drugmaker connected to one of Tidmarsh's former business associates filed a lawsuit alleging that he made \"false and defamatory statements\" during his time at the FDA.",
      "The lawsuit, brought by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, alleges that Tidmarsh used his FDA position to pursue a \"longstanding personal vendetta\" against the chair of the company's board of directors, Kevin Tang.",
      "Tang previously served as a board member of several drugmakers where Tidmarsh was an executive, including La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and Tidmarsh was involved in his ouster from those leadership positions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Messages placed to Tidmarsh and his lawyer were not immediately returned late Sunday.",
      "Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California's pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.",

      "The FDA's drug center, which Tidmarsh oversaw, has lost more than 1,000 staffers over the past year to layoffs or resignations, according to agency figures. The center is the largest division of the FDA and is responsible for the review, safety and quality control of prescription and over-the-counter medicines.",
      "In September, Tidmarsh drew public attention for a highly unusual post on LinkedIn stating that one of Aurinia Pharmaceutical's products, a kidney drug, had \"not been shown to provide a direct clinical benefit for patients.\" It's very unusual for an FDA regulator to single out individual companies and products in public comments online.",
      "According to the company's lawsuit, Aurinia's stock dropped 20% shortly after the post, wiping out more than $350 million in shareholder value.",
      "Tidmarsh later deleted the LinkedIn post and said he had posted it in his personal capacity, not as an FDA official.",
      "Aurinia's lawsuit also alleges, among other things, that Tidmarsh used his post at FDA to target a type of thyroid drug made by another company, American Laboratories, where Tang also serves as board chair.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut said she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.",
      "The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.",
      "It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.",
      "In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.",
      "Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of \"significant damage\" to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.",
      "\"Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,\" she wrote.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Mr. Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",
      "The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a \"rebellion\" or \"danger of rebellion\" \u2014 another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.",
      "Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns.",
      "R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was \"surprised\" to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.",
      "Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.",
      "Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building.",
      "The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",
      "Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that \"without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions\" or certain instances of criminal conduct, \"none of these incidents suggest ... that there's a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.\"",

      "A pair of federal judges ruled Friday that the Trump administration\u00a0must tap into a contingency fund\u00a0to continue making payments for food stamps under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is set to have its funding expire today. The president said the administration would provide funding for SNAP if \"we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court.\"Roughly 42 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits to help buy food, and the impending funding freeze had ramped up pressure on lawmakers to make a deal to end the government shutdown. The rulings took a SNAP shortfall off the table in the short term, but three other federal assistance programs are still set to lose funding today, leaving many low-income families scrambling.On Friday, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his stance on the filibuster remains \"unchanged,\" despite President Trump's call for the Senate to invoke the \"nuclear option\" to end the shutdown.In a post on Truth Social late Thursday night, Mr. Trump said the Senate should do away with the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation, which would allow Republicans to fund the government without Democratic votes.But Ryan Wrasse, a spokesman for Thune, said \"Leader Thune's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.\" The South Dakota Republican has vowed to uphold the filibuster, saying earlier this month that it has \"been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military has carried out another lethal strike on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post, said a U.S.-designated terrorist organization allegedly operated the vessel but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike.",
      "It's at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September. The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes.",
      "\"This vessel\u2014like EVERY OTHER\u2014was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said in a post on social media.",
      "Hegseth said no U.S. forces were harmed in the strike.",
      "The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",
      "The White House has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. lawmakers in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes, as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed.",
      "Hegseth, in his Saturday post announcing the latest strike, said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\"",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in an exclusive interview with CBS News on Oct. 24 that some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth.",
      "\"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote.",
      "Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.",
      "The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\"",
      "Earlier Friday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released a pair of letters sent to Hegseth, written in late September and early October, requesting the department's legal rationale for the strikes and the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.",
      "Warner told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Hegseth \"doesn't tell the truth\" on the briefing being shared on a bipartisan basis, saying \"we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written.\"",
      "\"That is not the way the system is supposed to work when you further partisan national security \u2014 when we're putting troops in harm's way,\" Warner said. \"I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:08:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday that airport delays are \"going to get worse\" as the government shutdown threatens to stretch into a fifth week and air traffic controllers were not paid this week.",
      "\"I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right?\" Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse.\"",
      "Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
      "Duffy's appearance comes as ground delays were reported at major airports on Sunday, including a four-hour ground delay at Newark Liberty Airport, one of the nation's busiest transit hubs. There were staffing triggers reported at airports in Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Northern California and Newark, New Jersey.",
      "The airport chaos is just weeks ahead of some of the busiest travel days of the year around Thanksgiving.",
      "As the government shutdown has stretched on for more than 30 days, air traffic controllers have gone without several paychecks, although they will get back pay when the shutdown ends. Duffy emphasized Sunday that air traffic controllers are being \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "However, Duffy ruled out the Trump administration finding a way to pay air traffic controllers, similar to how the active-duty military has been paid so far. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned active-duty military personnel won't be paid on Nov. 15.",
      "\"So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law,\" Duffy said about paying air traffic controllers. \"And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. \"",
      "While Duffy suggested on Oct. 9 that if air traffic controllers didn't show up to work, they could be \"let go,\" he said on Sunday that he doesn't plan on firing controllers.",
      "\"Again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said. \"I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.\"",
      "The Trump administration has continued to blame Democrats for the shutdown, but Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Sunday suggested that ending the shutdown is \"going to require the active intervention of the president.\"",
      "\"The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again,\" Warner said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The president of the United States has said when he was not president that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's stopped his many international trips; come sit down and let's get this resolved.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found that Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it. There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

    "story": [
      "After two years of trying to get pregnant, Maggie Quinn and Ricardo Escobar faced a financial obstacle they hadn't expected: the cost of in vitro fertilization in the United States.",
      "\"It was astronomical, and you don't know how many rounds you're going to need,\" Quinn said.",
      "With limited insurance coverage, the Florida couple started researching what's known as \"fertility tourism,\" where patients travel abroad for more affordable fertility care.",
      "Ricardo, who is originally from Colombia, found a clinic in the country's capital of Bogota offering a dramatic price difference\u2014a package of four IVF rounds in Colombia for $11,000 compared to around $60,000 for four rounds in the U.S. Medication costs were also less than half of those in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",
      "\"From the U.S., they mainly come for two things,\" Giraldo said. \"The first is cost, and the second is personalized treatment. It's really common that patients there feel they don't have a close relationship with their doctor.\"",
      "The couple made several trips to Colombia, where their first IVF round produced four viable embryos. After multiple embryo transfers, Quinn became pregnant and gave birth to their son, Lorenzo, in 2023. They returned the following year for another round and are now expecting again.",
      "Quinn estimates they saved between $15,000 and $20,000 per round. Her flexible work schedule made the travel possible, and some bloodwork and ultrasounds were completed in Florida.",

The replacement crew includes China's youngest-ever taikonaut \u2014 as China's space program calls its astronauts \u2014   and, for the first time since Beijing launched its program, it will also include live mammals.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",
      "The taikonauts will study the effects of microgravity and confined space conditions on the behavioral patterns of mice.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew, with Lu as their commander are scheduled to live aboard the space station for approximately six months, just like the crew they are replacing.",
      "It won't be the first visit to the station for Lu, who previously served on the Shenzhou-15 mission.",

      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",

      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",
      "China has already landed unmanned probes on the moon, including the first ever to land and collect samples from the celestial body's far side just last year.",
      "\"Overall, the research and construction has been running smoothly, with China aiming to achieve the goal of landing Chinese astronauts on the moon before 2030,\" Zhang said this week ahead of the looming Shenzhou launch, indicating that the CMSA remains on track to meet its lunar goals.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "The Senate reconvened Monday afternoon but is not currently scheduled to vote on a House-passed measure to fund the government. The government shutdown is on track to become the longest in history on Tuesday evening, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse.The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program after two federal judges directed it to do so.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "Almost 6,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, Nov. 2, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "The shutdown on Tuesday is set to become the longest in history, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse. In the meantime, air traffic controllers and workers for the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 both considered essential workers \u2014 are required to show up at their jobs even though their pay is halted until lawmakers agree on a new deal to fund the federal government.",
      "The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more likely it is to cause flight delays and snarls at security checkpoints, Katy Nastro, a travel expert at Going.com, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",
      "Some Houston travelers faced waits of about an hour to get through airport security lines this weekend, according to CBS affiliate KHOU. Only two out of five security checkpoints are open at Houston's Bush airport, the station noted, while the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported\u00a0that some people faced waits of three hours to get through the airport's security.",
      "Thanksgiving outlook for air travel",
      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",
      "Still, experts said that air safety isn't an issue, given that the FAA will slow flights if there aren't enough air traffic controllers directing flights. That was reiterated by Duffy on Sunday, who told \"Face the Nation\" that the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government is now in the midst of its second-longest shutdown, after Congress has repeatedly failed to pass a bill to fund the government on a temporary basis. The 2025 shutdown is a day shy of the record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 35 days and took place during President Trump's first administration.",
      "On Sept. 19, the House passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21, but the bill failed to make it out of the GOP-led Senate the same day. Since government funding lapsed on Oct. 1, the Senate has held a number of votes, but Republicans have not been able to garner the support they need from Democrats to advance the bill.",
      "Here's the government shutdown by the numbers:",

      "Since just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the Senate has voted 13 times on a House-passed resolution to fund the government until Nov. 21. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",
      "52: Senate Republicans supporting resolution to fund the government and end the shutdown",
      "43: Senate Democrats/independents opposed, plus 1 Republican",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone Republican joining most Democratic senators in voting against advancing the resolution to fund the government. He opposes the measure because it adds to the nation's rising debt.",

On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",

      "Witnesses told CBS affiliate\u00a0WAFB that the girls were ejected from the basket while the Ferris wheel was rotating. Two girls fell at least 20 feet onto a steel platform below, while a third clung to the basket, which was suspended about 15 feet in the air.",
      "\"As it was going around, it was just like, stuck at an angle and they flipped out of it,\" Ronald Brasseaux, who witnessed the incident, said. Brasseaux told WAFB that he'd felt unsafe while riding the same Ferris wheel the previous day. \"They need to take this thing down,\" he told the station.",
      "An investigation into what went wrong is underway at the State Fire Marshal's Office, which is required to perform safety checks on rides and attractions like the ones at New Roads' Harvest Festival, according to WAFB. The office told the station in the aftermath of Saturday's incident that only the Ferris wheel and one other nearby ride were closed to the public.",
      "Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff Rene' Thibodeaux, whose office responded to the incident, told WAFB that it happened around 12 p.m.. The Harvest Festival takes place annually in New Roads and \"is dedicated to supporting the local agriculture-based community,\" according to its website.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut said she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.",
      "The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.",
      "It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.",
      "In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.",
      "Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of \"significant damage\" to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.",
      "\"Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,\" she wrote.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Mr. Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",
      "The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a \"rebellion\" or \"danger of rebellion\" \u2014 another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.",
      "Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns.",
      "R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was \"surprised\" to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.",
      "Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.",
      "Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building.",
      "The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",

    "summary": "The shooting happened at an Airbnb in Bath Township, about 15 miles northwest of Akron. It was not immediately clear if all nine people were shot.",
    "story": [
      "Gunfire erupted early Sunday at a large rental home where teenagers had gathered for a birthday party that was promoted on social media, injuring nine people. The scene in northeastern Ohio was chaotic as some people fled and first responders performed life-saving measures, police said.",
      "The shooting happened at around 12:15 a.m. in Bath Township, about 15 miles northwest of Akron.",
      "At a Sunday morning news conference, Police Chief Vito Sinopoli said the seriousness of the victims' injuries was not clear. It was also not immediately clear if all nine people were shot \u2014 one person's leg injury may have been caused by a fall, he said.",
      "Sinopoli said the large home had been rented out on Airbnb, which is not allowed under local zoning ordinances, and most of the people at the party were under 18. He said the victims may include a mix of juveniles and adults. Their ages range from 15 to 20, CBS affiliate WOIO reported.",
      "Social media posts about the party drew a big crowd, Sinopoli said. It was not immediately known what sparked the shooting and how many people fired guns, he said. No arrests were announced.",
      "\"The Bath Township community experienced a tragic and senseless act of violence early this morning,\" Sinopoli said.",
      "Akron police and firefighters responded to the shooting, and Mayor Shammas Malik said the city will provide any assistance to the investigation that's underway.",
      "\"Those who perpetrate violence anywhere in our community must be held accountable for their actions. This kind of deadly behavior cannot be normalized,\" Malik said in a statement posted to social media. \"In addition, the reports of so many young people at a rented house party are very concerning. As we learn more about the situation that occurred last night, it appears to be part of a broader issue - helping make sure youth across our community are safe.\"",
      "Airbnb said in a statement Sunday that it prohibits \"unauthorized and disruptive gatherings,\" and it has suspended the property listing and removed the account of the person who rented the home. It said it has seen a 50% decrease in the rate of reported parties since 2020, when it put into effect a global party ban policy.",
      "\"We are heartbroken by this senseless act of gun violence, and our thoughts are with the injured victims and all those affected by it,\" the company said, adding that it was cooperating with the police investigation.",
      "Sinopoli said another shooting at an Airbnb rental home in town in 2017 wounded a person, who suffered a leg injury.",
      "\"It's pretty much an indicator that no community is immune from violence, and this happened to be in Bath Township again, unfortunately,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:08:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday that airport delays are \"going to get worse\" as the government shutdown threatens to stretch into a fifth week and air traffic controllers were not paid this week.",
      "\"I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right?\" Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse.\"",
      "Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
      "Duffy's appearance comes as ground delays were reported at major airports on Sunday, including a four-hour ground delay at Newark Liberty Airport, one of the nation's busiest transit hubs. There were staffing triggers reported at airports in Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Northern California and Newark, New Jersey.",
      "The airport chaos is just weeks ahead of some of the busiest travel days of the year around Thanksgiving.",
      "As the government shutdown has stretched on for more than 30 days, air traffic controllers have gone without several paychecks, although they will get back pay when the shutdown ends. Duffy emphasized Sunday that air traffic controllers are being \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "However, Duffy ruled out the Trump administration finding a way to pay air traffic controllers, similar to how the active-duty military has been paid so far. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned active-duty military personnel won't be paid on Nov. 15.",
      "\"So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law,\" Duffy said about paying air traffic controllers. \"And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. \"",
      "While Duffy suggested on Oct. 9 that if air traffic controllers didn't show up to work, they could be \"let go,\" he said on Sunday that he doesn't plan on firing controllers.",
      "\"Again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said. \"I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.\"",
      "The Trump administration has continued to blame Democrats for the shutdown, but Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Sunday suggested that ending the shutdown is \"going to require the active intervention of the president.\"",
      "\"The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again,\" Warner said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The president of the United States has said when he was not president that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's stopped his many international trips; come sit down and let's get this resolved.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found that Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it. There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And neither did Roger Wicker, Armed Services.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Right. The notion here is\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, the White House and the Republicans are in disagreement on this?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, there is not a lack of disagreement from members of the Senate that we've been asking for this legal justification for months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And they are now hiding the ball and only giving it out on a partisan basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Warner, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey.",
      "Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "SEAN DUFFY (U.S. Transportation Secretary): Hey. Thanks, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Listen, I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down. You'll see delays. We'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe.",
      "But we have to be honest. When we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But, again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't \u2013 we don't want crashes. We want people to go safely.",
      "And so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80 percent of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports. And, that same day, there was a near miss at La Guardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one.",
      "Was that pilot error or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago three-hour delays throughout New York.",
      "And, again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And, usually, when these planes are \u2013 are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers. It's usually pilot error. But, again, I will \u2013 I will have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers.",
      "But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if this shutdown continues, how \u2013 I \u2013 when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No. We will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen.",
      "I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money.",
      "And they're now confronted. They haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision. Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent, or do I go to work and not get paid?",
      "And they're making decisions. I have encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work. But they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers.",
      "Margaret, it's really important. And I think you've covered this. We don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money, like seems to be getting found for others like the military\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Yes. Well, I think that's a great question.",
      "So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember, under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open-air monuments in Washington, D.C., and was shutting down parks, just walking paths.",
      "President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law.",
      "And so we were able to fund essential air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that.",
      "And the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine. That's fair. But, again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis.",
      "And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether.",
      "So, practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part-time work elsewhere?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: No, I'm \u2013 I'm clearly asking them, I \u2013 come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid.",
      "But as I have traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Everyone watching your show today, as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life?",
      "And so they're \u2013 at the \u2013 next week, they're going to have \u2013 they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work.",
      "That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret. These are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational.",
      "They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running, and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system, we have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: But I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people. All the while, they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work\" and that they may be let go. There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: No, so, when \u2013 we're 2,000 to 3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I have tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy.",
      "Margaret, we're up 20 percent of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: And so as \u2013 when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less.",
      "And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed, in that we don't have enough controllers in our system. And this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long-term consequences\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control \u2013 no, listen, I have \u2013 no, I \u2013 again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have \u2013 I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them.",
      "They need support. They need money. They need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more from our latest CBS News poll, we turn to our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "So, Anthony, how are people feeling about the economy?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: I will start with prices, because that's where people tell us they start.",
      "They see prices as still high. They expect prices to keep going up. In some respects, that's not new. That's been the case for years, but that's rather the point. Things haven't changed. So the ratings are still very low for the economy.",
      "On another front, the stock market's going up. There's been an A.I. boom helping fuel that, but people have very mixed views of the U.S. job market. And part of that is, they think A.I. may come along and take their jobs, they tell us, right?",
      "Now, here's how that all plays politically, Margaret. And that is, on ratings for handling the economy, handling inflation, the president's ratings have been ticking down through the course of his term and continue to do so. That's a big reason that he won a year ago. That's one of the things they \u2013 people tell us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The economy.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: On the economy. People tell us today they still rate him on that and on handling immigration, where he does relatively a little bit better, especially with the base.",
      "But what I did was, I asked people, OK, compared to a year ago, do you think the president is trying to keep his campaign promises? And most people say yes. There's a but there. And there's a substantial number who say, but his approach isn't what they expected. And they're more mixed on that.",
      "So they see, and some give credit for trying. But for things like tariffs as it regards to the economy, the approach is much more mixed. And that underlines all those ratings for him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we have an election in some states Tuesday. What should we be watching for?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, he will certainly be a factor. I think the question for Democrats as you watch these races is, can they just run against him?",
      "So what I did was, I asked them \u2013 asked folks to compare nationally Donald Trump's approach and what they perceive as the Democrats' approach. And Donald Trump still leads the Democrats on those measures for the economy and on immigration.",
      "And what that tells you is, it may be, as you watch these races, Democrats can't just run against Donald Trump. They have got to have ideas of their own. We will see these races as sort of testing labs for what the parties may do ahead of 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching that closely.",
      "Anthony Salvanto, busy week for you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I know you've been in and out of Washington. But largely, the House members have not been here in town. The House hasn't voted since September 19th. It will be the seventh consecutive week now that they've been working from home. Would you urge Speaker Johnson to bring everyone back to try to break the impasse over government funding?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's up to the speaker. House Republicans and House Democrats coming back to Washington will not break the impasse. Let's not forget that the House passed a clean CR. And it was a temporary CR, OK.",
      "And, you know, Democrats keep saying, you know, the Republicans have no intent to negotiate. We can't trust them to want to negotiate if we reopen the government. That's nonsense. If we \u2013 look, if we had passed a year- long CR, I think they could make that argument. That's usually an indicator that we really don't want to talk about the budget right now. We want to \u2013 we want to kick the can down the road for a year.",
      "But when you pass a very short-term duration CR, a seven-week one \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It is a clear indication that we intend on continuing those conversations.",
      "So, look, there's other things we could do. The reason I keep going back is because I work on the Intelligence Committee and I have to do that work from inside D.C. There's a number of reasons people go back.",
      "But, look, in the end, the Senate has to deal with this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And Senate Democrats just have to reopen the government. It's that simple. They voted \u2013 I don't know, what is it, 15 times now to keep it closed?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: They wouldn't even vote to keep federal workers paid. I \u2013 that was a crazy lifeline that \u2013 that Senator Thune gave them, allowing them to vote \u2013 almost having the easy way out, allow them to at least vote to take the pain off of federal workers, and they voted that down, too. I really don't know what their strategy is at this point. They're the ones who need to figure this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so you heard \u2013 perhaps you heard Senator Warner at the top of the program say, you know, conversations are happening this week. He was hoping that there would be some \u2013 some end.",
      "On \u2013 on your side of the \u2013 of the Capitol, you're saying you don't see signs of this ending this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Don't see what? Sorry? Yes, I don't \u2013 I don't \u2013 I don't see us going back into session. I think we would have been notified by now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But, again, the impasse is not in the House. You know, we passed it out of the House. I realize that \u2013 that it was \u2013 there was a Democrat (ph) vote there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. But to come to an agreement, which is what he was \u2013 the senator was talking about everyone getting together and going to the White House with the president to \u2013 to hammer this out, the speaker at least. It doesn't sound like you have that level of optimism.",
      "But let \u2013 let's talk about the impact where you are. Your district includes parts of Houston. We checked the numbers and it appears 350,000 Houston area families may have some difficulty with their food stamps, these SNAP benefits, because of the standoff. Have you gotten any guidance from the state or from the administration about whether people get food payments this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Well, from what I can tell from the administration's statements, I mean, they're going to try to use the emergency contingency fund for \u2013 on a temporary basis.",
      "But look, the entire \u2013 I think there's about $6 billion in the fund.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Monthly SNAP benefits cost Americans $9 billion. So, that's \u2013 that is a very, very small band-aid. And the only way you're going to get SNAP benefits back on track is if Democrats vote for our clean CR.",
      "I visit a food bank recently. Yes, they're \u2013 they're preparing for a huge influx in demand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know, the state could only do so much on this. Every \u2013 we \u2013 we \u2013 all of us can only do so much. There's \u2013 there's a really simple solution to this, which is, just keep the government open. And, you know, you want to negotiate this very complex health care issue, which is what Democrats say they want. I think they've kind of chose it out of randomly and all of a sudden decided to throw this temper tantrum.",
      "But, fine, let's negotiate it. But you have to do it with the government open and not hold \u2013 you're not holding a gun to our heads. You're holding a gun to the regular American people's heads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on the Intelligence Committee. You mentioned you had \u2013 have had to come back here to view what I assume is classified intelligence. The president confirmed a few weeks back that he had authorized some CIA activity in Venezuela. He didn't give detail on that. But have you seen any evidence that the U.S. pressure campaign on Nicolas Maduro is working? That all this military hardware that's being moved around into the region is doing something?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I can \u2013 I can only tell you what I can assume. Look, having been out of session, we aren't getting the briefings because \u2013 because we aren't there. One of the reasons I keep going back is to look into these things.",
      "The broader question, this is more of a geopolitical question, is the pressure campaign working? Look, deterrence almost always works, especially when you're dealing with \u2013 with, you know, dictators like Maduro. They only listen to one thing, which is power.",
      "And \u2013 and Venezuela has been largely left alone by American administrations. The western hemisphere has been left alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And I think this president's taking it much more seriously. Look, the Venezuelan government is a \u2013 it's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's a fake government, right? He ran a rigged election. Everyone knows that. It's propped up by the Cubans and by the Russians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: They have been in collusion with terrorist groups, like the FARC, for years. It has been an annoyance to countries like Colombia for years. There's many high-ranking officials in government \u2013 in Venezuelan government that are literally under indictment for drug trafficking. It is effectively a narco terrorist state supporting narco terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Maduro is still in power. Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Maduro, what? I'm sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he still is in \u2013 in power. That's what \u2013 we were just talking about that with Senator Warner, the need for more information to go to lawmakers about exactly what the extent is going to be of U.S. military involvement. Would you support U.S. land strikes of Venezuela?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Actually, boots on the ground in Venezuela?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Land strikes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, I mean I think we would have to have a longer conversation about doing something to that extent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But I think what the \u2013 what the president is doing right now is very much within rational legal means, looking at drug boats that we have \u2013 that \u2013 and people ask, though, do we have the intelligence to really know what these drug boats are and who's on them? Yes, we do. That I can say. Right. We have \u2013 we have multisource intelligence that we \u2013 so, we know for sure what we're \u2013 what we're actually shooting at. And we don't even shoot at all the targets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And people say, well, why can't you just interdict it all? And I say, well, how \u2013 how many boats do you think we have? How many boats and helicopters do you think we have?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And do you know how risky an interdiction operation is? You're going to people \u2013 put people's lives at stake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right/",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: So, you do need to try something new, because it is an imminent harm to the United States. And that's clearly within the president's authority under Article Two.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. No, no, I was asking about land strikes. But \u2013 but let me ask you about something some of your fellow conservatives have been talking quite a lot about, including Mitch McConnell. He's been concerned about anti-Semitism on the right.",

      "I've had a long-standing feud with Tucker Carlson. I'm glad everyone is also waking up now to how bad of a person he is. He's changed a lot over the last 20 years. You know, hard to say why. But it doesn't really matter why. I mean you have a guy like Fuentes on your show. You're \u2013 you're uplifting what is \u2013 a guy who has really fallen off the radar, you know?",

You know, they were really on a \u2013 on a downhill slide. And for Tucker to have him on, you know, Senator Cruz is exactly right. And this idea that we have to, you know, that it's cancel culture if we \u2013 if we \u2013 if we \u2013 if we keep Tucker out of our circles from now on is just nonsense. It's a \u2013 I literally wrote a book on cancel culture. So, you know, I've thought deeply about this.",
      "Cancel culture means you're \u2013 you're canceling someone for what is basically a mainstream belief, or maybe a \u2013 maybe small \u2013 like honest mistake they made. That would be maybe considered cancel culture. It's not cancel culture when you say, look, I want to disassociate myself from you because your believes are crazy and you're psychopathic.",

I know you joined this lawsuit to try to sue the administration to get them to use emergency funding to pay for food stamps during the government shutdown. Given what happened with the courts Friday, will food stamp payments be going out this week? It's your state that has to administer the program, right?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Yes. I don't know, Margaret, because the president hasn't said whether he's going to approve the release of those contingency funds. I mean, the impact of this is just devastating. One in eight Americans, you say. I have about one in seven Massachusetts residents who are on SNAP. I was at food pantries yesterday. I mean people across our state do not want to see people go hungry. But people woke up on Saturday morning not having access to their benefits.",
      "The reason we sued, Margaret, 28 states, and I'm glad and grateful to the A.G.s for getting the favorable ruling. It basically tells the president, do what you're supposed to do, which is, use the contingency funds that have been set aside for exactly this purpose. When there is a shutdown, among other things, release those funds, continue the SNAP payments to our states.",
      "I strongly urge that. I hope it happens immediately on Monday. People in this country should not go hungry. And I think Americans don't want to see their brothers and sisters go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that federal judge in Rhode Island ordered full payments by Monday or partial SNAP payments by Wednesday. On another network the Treasury secretary was asked if \u2013 if the administration would do just that, and he said, \"could be.\"",
      "Practically speaking, how do you \u2013 how quickly can you turn it on? I mean if that comes through Wednesday, do people in Massachusetts get to eat on Thursday?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: No. I mean the problem, Margaret, with what the president has done is that he cut this off. And it takes a few days to load up those cards. I mean anywhere between two and five days.",
      "I will tell you what I am doing as governor, because I've got to protect my residents. I've got to work with others to make sure that they are fed. We've advanced funding to our food pantries. We stood up a United Way fund and already, you know, 3 million, I think, in contributions have come through this week. We have seen an incredible outpouring of volunteers. I was at food pantries yesterday and the turnout is something.",
      "And, you know, but \u2013 but this is not sustainable, right? I mean we cannot continue along this path, which is why he needs to release those funds as at least one court told him to do right now, as soon as possible, because it takes us time to load up those cards.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, here's how President Trump described the shutdown impact Friday. Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is say, the government is open, and that's the end of it. And, you know, largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm president. I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't he have a point that your party is responsible for some of this pain?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Yes, absolutely not. And, frankly, that's a really insulting comment.",
      "You know, Margaret, I've got 21,000 veterans, men and women who have served our country, who are SNAP beneficiaries in Massachusetts, who had their benefits turned off, who face hunger right now. To be clear, you want to know who SNAP beneficiaries are in the country? They're our seniors, they're kids, and they're people with disabilities. They live in every state, and every city and town around the country. And for the president to even suggest something like that or say something like that is insulting.",
      "And this is the part \u2013 this is the problem with D.C. You showed the poll, right? I mean, at the end of the day, the president and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. And, you know, Mike Johnson hasn't had these guys back in session I think but for 12 out of 100 of the last days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: So, get back to Washington. Get back to the table. Sort this out. Americans want to see that people are fed. They want to make sure that they have access to childcare, because health \u2013 Headstart's getting turned off, too. And they don't want to see their health premiums go up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: I mean that's what's happening right now. And the impact is being felt everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and the top five states are districts with the highest percentage of residents who use food stamps are in New Mexico, D.C., Louisiana, Oregon, and Oklahoma. Two of those states are ruby red and voted for President Trump in last election. I think that's what you're pointing to in terms of insult.",
      "But on the substance of why we are in this shutdown, Democrats have refused to sign on to a clean government funding bill. On that point, don't Democrats bear some responsibilities?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: What Democrats in Congress did is stand with hundreds of thousands, millions of Americans right now who are seeing their premiums go up. I've got people in Massachusetts who just got notices because of the expiration of these subsidies. They're going to see their premiums rise as much as $20,000. American families can't afford that, you know?",
      "And I'm focused on economic hardship and what I can do to protect my people. And I think most of us are in our states as governors. Which is why the folks in D.C. need to get back to work. Mike Johnson needs to call his members back because, how are you going to get a negotiation if you're not even in D.C., right? You got to get back to D.C. The president has got to give a clear directive to Republicans that they need to reopen government because Americans are suffering and continue to suffer every single day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Healey, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Juan Andrade, CEO of financial services company USAA. Many of its nearly 14 million customers are in the military or veterans. And he joins us from San Antonio.",
      "Sir, Secretary Bessent said on this program just last Sunday that by November 15th the troops and service members aren't going to be paid. What level of anxiety are you seeing among your customers?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE (President and CEO, USAA): Margaret, thank you for having me on your show.",
      "What we're seeing today is uncertainty, anxiety, and, for some, real hardship. And that's really within the \u2013 the active duty community. It's also important to note that 30 percent of federal employees are also veterans or military spouses. So, this is more than an impact to a Household budget. This can really undermine morale and focus. And our goal is to provide stability for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and who are, frankly, losing ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I've seen that you're offering interest free loans to customer. Is that everyone or just specifically active duty military? And if they can't qualify for a loan, what do they do?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: So, we're offering our government shutdown program to all eligible members of USAA. So, as you said, that's currently about 14.5 million people. And at that point we've acted swiftly and decisively. In the first 48 hours of the shutdown, we funded $150 million in zero interest loans. We are now up to $400 million to date. But that's also in addition to payment extensions that we've done on credit cards, auto loans, mortgages. We've also waived fees for overdraft. And we've also had flexible insurance arrangements across our property casualty, life, and health insurance businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: $400 million in zero interest loans. So, people are already looking to try to figure out how to make ends meet.",
      "We looked, and a quarter of all active-duty military members are food insecure according to the Department of Agriculture. That was well before this shutdown. That means they don't have a good diet or they're not able to afford food.",
      "We already saw strain on a lot of that active-duty military. Can you give us a sense of what this means for someone now to look at the calendar and know November 15th there's no pay coming?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: Yes. And I agree. This is one of the reasons why we've already funded 400 million in loans at this point in time. People are preparing for an uncertain period of time. And this is very important to them, particularly if we think about our younger enlisted, and particularly those with families.",
      "Dual incomes in military families is not a luxury, it's a necessity. So, these are people that we're very worried about. And we want to make sure that they're stable through this period of time.",
      "The other part of this, and, frankly, the reason for doing these zero interest loans, is we want to make sure that they don't turn to high interest rate payday loans or high interest rate credit cards at the same time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the unemployment rate among civilian military spouses is almost five times the national average, to your point, they need dual income. Many can't do that.",
      "But the Congressional Budget Office projection is that there will be an economic cost. That the shutdown itself could lead to $7 billion to $14 billion in lost growth. What's the impact on the communities like yours where you are living down in Texas, you know, in areas where there are bases around this country?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: Sure. I think you see it in a few ways. I think one is definitely on consumer spending. Right now people are prioritizing basic needs, whether it's health or food at this point in time. So, they're definitely cutting back on \u2013 on discretionary spending. I think that's part of that.",
      "The other aspect of it is, you're going to see more people who are food insecure. And this is one of the reasons why we have also been supporting our local communities. Our offices are all located near major military installations. And we have donated millions to military aid societies who are best positioned to provide food and over services in installations. And we've also been donating to local food banks in our communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how does this compare to the last extended shutdown that we had during the first Trump administration?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: The last shutdown basically has not \u2013 did not last as long. I think that was a big part of that. And we also had the certainty that the military would be getting paid. Now, clearly, up until now, they have been getting paid. The question of the uncertainty that we're seeing from our members is, what happens over the next couple of weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you were already planning for that November 15 \u2013 when you say the shutdown wasn't this long, you were assuming the government does not get funded for how long?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: We're already \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How long can you keep doing this?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: We're already planning for a second loan to members. So, we've had a number take us up certainly on the first offer of loan. Now they're taking us up on the second offer of loan. And we're prepared to assist. That's our job. And to take our members in the military community. So, we will keep up with this. And if we have to do more, we will do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we \u2013 we are thinking of your customers at this time. We'll continue to track what happens with that real-world impact.",
      "Thank you, Mr. Andrade.",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: Thank you, Margaret.",

      "Down 4-3 with one out at the top of the ninth inning, Dodgers shortstop Miguel Rojas hit a solo home run to tie it up at four runs apiece and send the game into extra innings.",
      "Then, at the top of the 11th inning, Dodgers catcher Will Smith hit a solo home run to seal the extraordinary comeback victory.",
      "The Dodgers became\u00a0the first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees, and in the process denied the Blue Jays their first title since 1993.",
      "The Dodgers were down 3-2 in the series, rallying back and winning the final two games in Toronto to quiet a stunned home crowd.",
      "L.A. overcame 3-0 and 4-2 deficits and escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth.",
      "Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw 96 pitches in the Dodgers' win on Friday, escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth and pitched 2 2/3 innings for his third win of the Series.",
      "He gave up a leadoff double in the 11th to Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who was sacrificed to third. Addison Barger walked and Alejandro Kirk grounded to shortstop Mookie Betts, who started a title-winning 6-4-3 double play.",
      "With their ninth title and third in six years, the Dodgers made an argument for their 2020s teams to be considered a dynasty. Dave Roberts, their manager since 2016, boosted the probability he will gain induction to the Hall of Fame.",
      "Bo Bichette put Toronto ahead in the third with a three-run homer off two-way star Shohei Ohtani, who was pitching on three days' rest after taking the loss in Game 3.",
      "L.A. closed to 3-2 on sacrifice flies from Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez in the fourth off Max Scherzer and Tommy Edman in the sixth against Chris Bassitt.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez restored Toronto's two-run lead with an RBI double in the sixth off Tyler Glasnow, who relieved after getting the final three outs on three pitches to save Game 6 on Friday.",
      "Max Muncy's eighth-inning homer off star rookie Trey Yesavage cut the Dodgers' deficit to one run, and Rojas, inserted into the lineup in Game 6 to provide some energy, homered on a full-count slider from Jeff Hoffman.",
      "Toronto put two on with one out in the bottom half against Blake Snell, and Los Angeles turned to Yamamoto.",
      "He hit Alejandro Kirk on a hand with a pitch, loading the bases and prompting the Dodgers to play the infield in and the outfield shallow. Daulton Varsho grounded to second, where Rojas stumbled but managed to throw home for a forceout as catcher Smith kept his foot on the plate.",
      "Ernie Clement then flied out to Andy Pages, who made a jumping, backhand catch on the center-field warning track as he crashed into left fielder Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Seranthony Dom\u00ednguez walked Mookie Betts with one out in the 10th and Muncy singled for his third hit. Hern\u00e1ndez walked, loading the bases. Pages grounded to shortstop, where Gim\u00e9nez threw home for a forceout. First baseman Guerrero then threw to pitcher Seranthony Dom\u00ednguez covering first, just beating Hern\u00e1ndez in a call upheld in a video review.",
      "The epic night matched the Marlins' 3-2 win over Cleveland in 1997 as the second-longest Series Game 7, behind only the Washington Senators' 4-3 victory against the New York Giants in 1924.",
      "The game was expectantly tense, with both benches and bullpens clearing after Dodgers left-hander Justin Wrobleski hit Blue Jays shortstop Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez on the right hand with a pitch in the fourth inning.",
      "After the players returned to their benches and bullpens, the umpires huddled briefly before crew chief Mark Wegner issued a warning to both dugouts.",
      "Ohtani started the game, but was pulled off the mound after allowing Bo Bichette's three-run homer in the third inning. Pitching on three days of rest, Ohtani was up to 100.9 mph with his fastball but appeared to run out of steam in the third.",
      "Ohtani allowed three runs and five hits in 2 1/3 innings before he was replaced by left-hander Justin Wrobleski. Ohtani walked two and struck out three.",
      "Earlier, Ohtani became the first pitcher to get a hit in a World Series Game 7 since Jesse Orosco of the New York Mets in 1986.",

    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

    "summary": "A day after attending the opening ceremony of the Grand Egyptian Museum, the leader of the Netherlands said an ancient statue discovered at an art fair would be returned.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo\u00a0\u2014 The prime minister of the Netherlands announced Sunday that the European nation will soon return a 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt, a day after he attended the lavish opening ceremony of the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza.",
      "Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in a statement that, during a meeting on Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, he informed his counterpart that the Netherlands would return a bust of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III.",
      "The piece was discovered up for sale at an art fair in 2022 and was confiscated after Dutch authorities received an anonymous tip about its illegal origin, according to a statement from the Dutch government.",
      "The statement said the art show \"trader voluntarily renounced the sculpture\" and that Dutch police and other officials \"have investigated the origin of the head and found that the head was obtained by looting and was unlawfully exported.\"",
      "The bust is expected to be handed over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands by the end of this year, the statement said.",
      "It will be the first artifact returned to Egypt since the GEM's grand opening event. Several campaigns before the opening have sought to bring looted Egyptian antiquities back to the country.",
      "Egypt's government hosted dozens of foreign leaders and dignitaries on Saturday for the official opening ceremony of the new facility, a $1 billion project that was decades in the making.",
      "\"It is a great day for Egypt and for humanity. This is Egypt's gift to the world. It's a dream come true, after all these years, the GEM is finally and officially open,\" Nevine El-Aref, media adviser to the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",
      "Egyptian officials hope the new museum will boost the country's tourism industry, and with it, the still-struggling economy. They have predicted that the GEM will attract some 5 million visitors per year.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:00:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Belgium's defense minister confirmed that drones had flown into the area near the Kleine Brogel air base in northeast Belgium in two phases.",
    "story": [
      "Belgium's defense minister expressed concern on Monday about a series of unidentified drone flights over the weekend near a military base where U.S. nuclear weapons are stored, saying they seem to be part of a spying operation.",
      "Defense Minister Theo Francken confirmed that drones had flown into the area near the Kleine Brogel air base in northeast Belgium in two phases on Saturday and Sunday night.",
      "The first phase involved \"small drones to test the radio frequencies\" of Belgian security services, then later came \"big drones to destabilize the area and people,\" Francken told public broadcaster RTBF.",
      "\"It resembles a spy operation. By whom, I don't know. I have a few ideas but I'm going to be careful\" about speculating, he said. Last month, several drones were spotted above another Belgian military base near the German border. The operators were not identified.",
      "Russia has been blamed for a number of airspace violations, notably in Estonia and Poland, in recent months. But the perpetrators of a series of mysterious drone flights in Denmark and Germany have been harder to pin down.",
      "A late evening drone sighting at Berlin's Brandenburg airport on Friday suspended flights for nearly two hours. It was not clear who was responsible. On Sunday, some flights were delayed at Bremen Airport in Germany after a drone was spotted in the area, but police did not suspect espionage in that case, local media reported.",
      "Francken ruled out that the weekend drone flights in Belgium might have been a prank. He said that the security services' \"jammer didn't work because they tested our radio frequency, and they changed frequency. They have their own frequencies. An amateur doesn't know how to do that.\"",
      "Asked why it wasn't possible to shoot the drones down, Francken said: \"When they're over a military base we can shoot the drones down. When it's nearby, we have to be very careful because they can fall on a house, a car, a person. That's completely different.\"",
      "This can pose legal challenges too. \"It's not entirely clear. We have to clarify the legal grounds,\" he said.",
      "Francken lamented that Belgium \"is chasing after the threat\" posed by such drone flights. \"We should have bought air defense systems five or 10 years ago,\" that can deal with drones, he said.",
      "A series of mysterious drone overflights have been spotted in the airspace of European Union member countries in recent weeks.",
      "In October, a Belgian official familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News that drones had been sighted over Elsenborn military base, and said that the number of drones was under investigation. Belgium is a member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance but the source told CBS News that only Belgian forces are stationed at the Elsenborn base.",
      "Also last month, Germany's Munich Airport shut down twice in less than 24 hours after multiple drone sightings. An airport in Lithuania also later closed for several hours overnight Saturday due to a possible sighting of balloons.",
      "In September, the Danish defense ministry said drones were \"observed at several of Danish defense facilities\" during an overnight period. Those drone sightings\u00a0come after several drones were spotted in the Nordic country days earlier, with some of them temporarily shutting down Danish airports.",
      "Drones have also been spotted near military sites in the U.S. this year. The head of NORAD and NORTHCOM \u2014 the military commands that defend North America \u2014 told Congress earlier this year that some of the mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed have been spying.",

      "The word \"candy,\" rather than \"sweets,\" was cited as the second-most imported word, as reported by 40% of the teachers surveyed.",
      "The survey, conducted by Teacher Tapp for The Times of London, involved more than 10,000 educators, and the findings suggest the shift to Americanisms is particularly prevalent among younger children. The survey found that teachers of high school aged children reported fewer examples of such U.S. vocabulary slipping into their pupils' speech.",
      "The terms \"apartment,\" rather than \"flat,\" \"diaper\" instead of \"nappy\" and \"movie theater\" instead of \"cinema\" are some of the other swaps reported by teachers.",
      "A linguist interviewed by The Times, however, sought to reassured concerned parents that trends in children's language change quickly and frequently. Professor Lynne Murphy, who teaches British and American English at the University of Sussex, told the newspaper that academics tend to rely on trends in adult language for that reason.",
      "\"We adults don't talk like we did when we were four, or eight or 12, and neither will today's children,\" Murphy added.",
      "She also noted that while U.S. vocabulary may be imported to Britain via online media, the same thing can happen in the other direction. In 2019, CBS News reported that some parents had noticed their children developing British accents after watching the \"Peppa Pig,\" the British children's program with a remarkable worldwide reach.",
      "Speaking to The Times, some British parents gave anecdotal evidence, saying they had noticed their kids using Americanisms \u2014 and tried to intervene.",
      "Stacie Swift, a mother of three in Cambridgeshire, said: \"I've had to correct my children, who are 10 and eight years old, as they slip into Americanisms.\"",
      "\"Every now and then they slip into conversation. It's usually because they have been watching American YouTube videos or cartoons,\" she added.",
      "Frank Young blamed the \"fragmentation\" of childrens' TV programs in the U.K. for his nine-year-old son's occasional lapses into U.S. parlance.",

      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Palestinian militants have so far released the remains of 20 hostages that were held in Gaza for the past two years as part of the ceasefire agreement in the Israel-Hamas war. But the process of returning the bodies of the last eight remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, is progressing slowly, with militants releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "Hamas says it has not been able to reach all of the remains because they are buried under rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel's two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israel's government and the families of the hostages have accused Hamas of dragging its feet, however, and officials have threatened to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all of the remains are not returned.",
      "In the most recent release, Hamas returned the bodies on Sunday of three troops killed during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. Israel's military confirmed that the remains belonged to hostages Omer Neutra, an Israeli American dual national, Oz Daniel and Col. Assaf Hamami.",
      "In return, Israel has so far released the bodies of 270 Palestinians back to Gaza, including 45 handed over on Monday, according to Palestinian media. Israel has not provided any details on their identities, and it is unclear if they were killed in Israel during the attack on Oct. 7, or if they were Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody, or bodies that were taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war.",

Chen loved basketball and studying human biology, according to the Israeli Hostages Families Forum.",

She hid in the bushes for a number of hours before militants discovered her and killed her. She was able to tell her children that Meny had been killed before she died. The family held a double funeral for the couple. They are survived by four children and six grandchildren.",
      "Hadar Goldin's remains are the only ones that have been held in Gaza since before the war. The Israeli soldier was killed on Aug. 1, 2014, two hours after a ceasefire took effect ending that year's war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Goldin is survived by his parents and three siblings, including a twin. He had proposed to his fianc\u00e9e before he was killed.

He is survived by his parents and a sister.",

    "summary": "China rejects Trump's claim to 60 Minutes about clandestine nuclear tests, as a senior official seeks to clarify the president's plans for U.S. tests.",
    "story": [
      "China's Foreign Ministry responded on Monday to President Trump's assertion that Beijing has conducted clandestine nuclear weapons testing with a flat denial.",
      "\"China's testing 'em too,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview for 60 Minutes. \"You just don't know about it.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report \u2014 they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "\"They don't go and tell you about it,\" continued Mr. Trump. \"You know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They \u2014 they test way under \u2014 underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.",
      "\"You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China \u2014 and China does test, and we're gonna test also.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plans to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 A medieval tower in the heart of Italy's capital, near the famous Roman Forum ruins, partially collapsed on Monday during renovations of the structure, critically injuring one worker and trapping another, authorities said.",
      "Hundreds of tourists watched as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti to rescue the worker who remained trapped.",
      "During the rescue attempt, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly retreat.",
      "Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari confirmed that the one remaining worker remained trapped hours after the initial collapse. He added that a rescued worker was being treated in critical condition and that another three workers were rescued unharmed.",
      "The initial collapse happened some time before noon, and did not appear to have involved any bystanders.",
      "Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlor when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession.",
      "\"I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,'' Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background.",
      "German student Viktoria Braeu passed by the scene just as the partial collapse during the firefighters' rescue occurred.",
      "\"We were just at the Colosseum \u2026 and we were just walking to get some food. ... And then we were like, 'It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting,'' said Braeu, 18.",
      "Four firefighters later approached the first-floor window on two mobile ladders, but were quickly pulled back when dust emerged. Authorities then positioned a drone in front of the window in an apparent attempt to check the condition of the trapped worker.",

    "summary": "The former Prince Andrew is set to lose his final military title, as King Charles continues shunning his younger brother over historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",

One man, born in the United Kingdom, was in custody Sunday after a second man arrested in connection with the attack was released without charges. Both were arrested eight minutes after the first emergency calls were made from aboard the train, where passengers had reported scenes of panic and chaos as many ran through the carriages and some sought safety in the bathrooms.",

      "The U.S. military has carried out another lethal strike on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post, said a U.S.-designated terrorist organization allegedly operated the vessel but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike.",
      "It's at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September. The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes.",
      "\"This vessel\u2014like EVERY OTHER\u2014was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said in a post on social media.",
      "Hegseth said no U.S. forces were harmed in the strike.",
      "The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",
      "The White House has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. lawmakers in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes, as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed.",
      "Hegseth, in his Saturday post announcing the latest strike, said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\"",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in an exclusive interview with CBS News on Oct. 24 that some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth.",
      "\"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote.",
      "Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.",
      "The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\"",
      "Earlier Friday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released a pair of letters sent to Hegseth, written in late September and early October, requesting the department's legal rationale for the strikes and the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.",
      "Warner told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Hegseth \"doesn't tell the truth\" on the briefing being shared on a bipartisan basis, saying \"we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written.\"",
      "\"That is not the way the system is supposed to work when you further partisan national security \u2014 when we're putting troops in harm's way,\" Warner said. \"I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with USAA CEO Juan Andrade that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Juan Andrade, CEO of financial services company USAA. Many of its nearly 14 million customers are in the military or veterans, and he joins us from San Antonio. Sir, Secretary Bessent said on this program just last Sunday that by November 15, the troops and service members aren't going to be paid. What level of anxiety are you seeing among your customers?",
      "USAA PRESIDENT JUAN ANDRADE: Margaret, thank you for having me on your show. What we're seeing today is uncertainty, anxiety and, for some, real hardship, and that's really within the- the active duty community. It's also important to note that 30% of federal employees are also veterans or military spouses. So this is more than an impact to a household budget. This can really undermine morale and focus, and our goal is to provide stability for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and who are frankly losing ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I've seen that you're offering interest free loans to customers. Is- is that everyone, or just specifically active duty military? And- and if they can't qualify for a loan, what do they do?",
      "ANDRADE: So we're offering our government shutdown program to all eligible members of USAA. So as you said, that's currently about 14 and a half million people, and at this point, we've acted swiftly and decisively. In the first 48 hours of the shutdown, we funded 150 million in zero interest loans. We are now up to 400 million to date. But that's also in addition to payment extensions that we've done on credit cards, auto loans, mortgages. We've also waived fees for overdraft and we've also had flexible insurance arrangements across our property, casualty, life and health insurance businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Four hundred million in zero interest loans. So people are already looking to try to figure out how to make ends meet. We looked, and a quarter of all active duty military members are food insecure, according to the Department of Agriculture, that was well before this shutdown. That means they don't have a good diet, or they're not able to afford food. We already saw strain on a lot of that active duty military. Can you give us a sense of- of what this means for someone now, to- to look at the calendar and know November 15, there's no pay coming?",
      "ANDRADE: Yeah, and- and- and I agree this is one of the reasons why we've already funded 400 million in loans at this point in time. People are preparing for an uncertain period of time, and this is very important to them, particularly if we think about our younger enlisted and particularly those with families. Dual incomes in military families is not a luxury, it's a necessity. So these are people that we're very worried about, and we want to make sure that they're stable through this period of time. The other part of this, and frankly, the reason for doing these zero interest loans is we want to make sure that they don't turn to high interest rate payday loans or high interest rate credit cards at the same time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the unemployment rate among civilian military spouses is almost five times the national average, to your point, that they need dual income. Many can't do that, but the Congressional Budget Office projection is that there will be an economic cost, that the shutdown itself could lead to seven to 14 billion in lost growth. What's the impact on the communities like yours, where you were living, down in Texas, you know, in areas where there are bases around this country?",
      "ANDRADE: Sure, I think you see it in a few ways. I think one is definitely on consumer spending. Right now, people are prioritizing basic needs, whether it's health or food at this point in time, so they're definitely cutting back on- on discretionary spending. I think that's part of that. The other aspect of it is you're going to see more people who are food insecure, and this is one of the reasons why we have also been supporting our local communities. Our offices are all located near major military installations, and we have donated millions to military aid societies who are best positioned to provide food and other services in installations, and we've also been donating to local food banks in our communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how does this compare to the last extended shutdown that we had during the first Trump administration?",
      "ANDRADE: The- the last shutdown basically has not- did not last as long. I think that was a big part of that. And we also had the certainty that the military would be getting paid. Now, clearly, up until now, they have been getting paid. The question of the uncertainty that we're seeing from our members is what happens over the next couple of weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you were already planning for that November 15- when you say the shutdown wasn't this long, you're assuming the government does not get funded for how long? How long can you keep doing this?",
      "ANDRADE: We're already- we're already planning for a second loan to members, so we've had a number take us up, certainly on the first offer of loan. Now, they're taking us up on the second offer of loan, and we're prepared to assist. That's our-our job, and to take care of our members in the military community. So we will keep up with this. And if we have to do more, we will do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we- we are thinking of your customers at this time, we will continue to track what happens with that real world impact. Thank you, Mr. Andrade.",
      "ANDRADE: Thank you, Margaret.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Massachusetts Democratic Governor Maura Healey, who joins us this morning from Boston. Governor, welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A family of four receiving food stamps makes $31,000 or less per year. That program gives less than $200 a month to one in eight Americans. It's 42 million people. I know you joined this lawsuit to try to sue the administration to get them to use emergency funding to pay for food stamps during the government shutdown. Given what happened with the courts Friday, will food stamp payments be going out this week? It's your state that has to administer, administer the program, right?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Yeah, I don't know Margaret because the President hasn't said whether he's going to approve the release of those contingency funds. I mean, the, the impact of this is just devastating. One in eight Americans, you say, I have about one in seven Massachusetts residents who are on SNAP. I was at food pantries yesterday. I mean people across our state do not want to see people go hungry, but people woke up on Saturday morning not having access to their benefits. The reason we sued, Margaret, 28 states, and I'm glad and grateful to the AGs for getting the favorable ruling. It basically tells the President do what you're supposed to do, which is use the contingency funds that have been set aside for exactly this purpose, when there is a shutdown among other things, release those funds, continue the SNAP payments to our states. I strongly urge that. I hope it happens immediately on Monday. People in this country should not go hungry, and I think Americans don't want to see their brothers and sisters go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that federal judge in Rhode Island ordered full payments by Monday or partial SNAP payments by Wednesday. On another network, the Treasury Secretary was asked if, if the administration would do just that, and he said, could be. Practically speaking how do you, how quickly can you turn it on? I mean, if that comes through Wednesday, do people in Massachusetts get to eat on Thursday?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: No. I mean the problem, Margaret, with what the President has done is that he cut this off and it takes a few days to load up those cards. I mean anywhere between two and five days. I will tell you what I am doing as governor because I've got to protect my residents. I've got to work with others to make sure that they are fed. We've advanced funding to our food pantries. We stood up a United Way fund, and already, you know, 3 million, I think, in contributions have come through this week. We have seen an incredible outpouring of volunteers. I was at food pantries yesterday, and the turnout is something. And, you know, but, but this is not sustainable. Right? I mean we cannot continue along this path, which is why he needs to release those funds, as at least one court told him to do, right now. As soon as possible, because it takes us time to load up those cards.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So here's how President Trump described the shutdown impact Friday. Take a listen.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it. And you know, largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm President, I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't he have a point that your party is responsible for some of this pain?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Absolutely not and, frankly, that's a really insulting comment. You know, Margaret, I've got 21,000 veterans, men and women who have served our country, who are SNAP beneficiaries in Massachusetts, who had their benefits turned off, who face hunger right now. To be clear, you want to know who SNAP beneficiaries are in this country? They're our seniors, they're kids, and they're people with disabilities. They live in every state, in every city and town around this country. And for the President to even suggest something like that or to say something like that is insulting. And this is the part, this is the problem with, with D.C. You showed the poll, right? I mean, at the end of the day, the President and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and, you know, Mike Johnson hasn't had these guys back in session, I think, but for 12 out of 100 of the last days. So get back to Washington, get back to the table. Sort this out. Americans want to see that people are fed. They want to make sure that they have access to child care, because health, Head Start's getting turned off too. And they don't want to see their health premiums go up. I mean, that's what's happening right now, and the impact is being felt everywhere",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and the top five states or districts with the highest percentage of residents who use food stamps are New Mexico, D.C., Louisiana, Oregon and Oklahoma. Two of those states are ruby red and voted for President Trump in last election. I think that's what you're pointing to in terms of insult, but on the substance of why we are in this shut down, Democrats have refused to sign on to a clean government funding bill. On that point, don't Democrats bear some responsibility?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: What Democrats in Congress did is stand with hundreds of\u00a0 thousands, millions of Americans right now who are seeing their premiums go up. I've got people in Massachusetts who just got notices because of the expiration of the subsidies. They're going to see their premiums rise as much as $20,000. American families can't afford that, you know. And I'm focused on economic hardship and what I can do to protect my people and I think most of us are in our states as governors, which is why the folks in D.C. need to get back to work. Mike Johnson needs to call his members back because how are you going to get a negotiation if you're not even in D.C., right? You got to get back to D.C. The president has got to give a clear directive to Republicans that they need to reopen government because Americans are suffering and continue to suffer every single day.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I know you've been in and out of Washington, but largely that the House members have not been here in town. The House hasn't voted since September 19. It will be the seventh consecutive week now that they've been working from home. Would you urge Speaker Johnson to bring everyone back to try to break the impasse over government funding?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's up to the Speaker. House Republicans and House Democrats coming back to Washington, will not break the impasse. Let's not forget that the House passed a clean CR. It was a temporary CR, okay. And you know, Democrats keep saying the Republicans have no intent to negotiate. We can't trust them to want to negotiate if we reopen the government. That's nonsense. If we had- look, if we had passed a year-long CR, I think they could make that argument. That's usually an indicator that we really don't want to talk about the budget right now, we want to- we want to keep the can down the road for a year. But when you pass a very short term duration CR, a seven-week one, it is a clear indication that we intend on continuing those conversations. So look, there's other things we could do. The reason I keep going back is because I work on the Intelligence Committee, and I have to do that work from inside DC. There's a number of reasons people go back. But look, in the end, the Senate has to deal with this, and Senate Democrats just have to reopen the government. It's that simple. They voted- I don't even what is it, 15 times now, to keep it closed. They wouldn't even vote to keep federal workers paid. That was a crazy lifeline that Senator Thune gave them, allowing them to vote, almost have the easy way out, allow them to at least vote to take the pain off of federal workers. And they voted that down too. I really don't know what their strategy is at this point. They're the ones that need to figure this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you heard- perhaps you heard Senator Warner at the top of the program say, you know, conversations are happening this week. He was hoping that there would be some- some end. On your side of the- of the Capitol. You're saying you don't see signs of this ending this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Don't see what- sorry, yeah- I don't, I don't see us going back into session. I think we would have been notified by now. Yeah, but again, the impasse is not in the House. You know, we passed it out of the House--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Understood-- but to come to an agreement, which is was- the senator was talking about everyone getting together and going to the White House with the President to hammer this out. The speaker, at least, it doesn't sound like you have that level of optimism. But let's talk about the impact where you are. Your district includes parts of Houston. We checked the numbers, and it appears 350,000 Houston area families may have some difficulty with their food stamps, these SNAP benefits because of the standoff. Have you gotten any guidance from the state or from the administration about whether people get food payments this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Well, from what I can tell from the administration's statements, I mean, they're going to try to use the emergency contingency fund for- on a temporary basis. But look the entire- I think there's about $6 billion in that fund. The monthly SNAP benefits cost Americans $9 billion so that's- that is a very, very small band aid. And the only way you're going to get SNAP benefits back on track is if Democrats vote for our clean CR. I visited a food bank recently. Yeah, they're preparing for a huge influx in demand. You know, the state can only do so much on this. We- all of us can only do so much there's- there's a really simple solution to this, which is just keep the government open and you know, you want to negotiate this very complex health care issue, which is what Democrats say they want. I think they kind of chose it out of- randomly, and all of a sudden decided throw this temper tantrum. But fine, let's negotiate it, but you have to do it with the government open and not hold- you're not holding a gun to our heads. You're holding a gun to the regular American people's heads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on the Intelligence Committee. You mentioned you had, have had to come back here to view what I assume is classified intelligence. The President confirmed a few weeks back that he had authorized some CIA activity in Venezuela, he didn't give detail on that, but have you seen any evidence that the US pressure campaign on Nicolas Maduro is working, that all this military hardware that's being moved around into the region is doing something?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: I can only tell you what I can assume, having been out of session, we aren't getting the briefings because- because we aren't there. One of the reasons I keep going back is to look into these things. The broader question- this is more of a geopolitical question, is the pressure campaign working? Well, look, deterrence almost always works, especially when you're dealing with- with dictators like Maduro. They only listen to one thing, which is power. And Venezuela has been largely left alone by American administrations. The western hemisphere has been left alone, and I think this President is taking it much more seriously. Look, the Venezuelan government is a, it's- it's- it's a fake government, right? He ran a rigged election. Everyone knows that it's propped up by the Cubans and by the Russians. They have been in collusion with terrorist groups like the FARC for years. It has been an annoyance to countries like Colombia for years. There's many high-level ranking officials in government- in Venezuelan government that are literally under indictment for drug trafficking. It is effectively a narco-terrorist state--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But Maduro is still in power--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW:-- Maduro, what? Sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that he still is in- in power. That's what we were just talking about that with Senator Warner. The- the need for more information to go to lawmakers about exactly what the extent is going to be of US military involvement. Would you support US land strikes in Venezuela?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Actually boots on the ground in Venezuela?--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Land strikes--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: -- I think we would have to have to have a longer conversation about doing something to that extent. But I think what the- what the President is doing right now is very much within rational legal means, looking at drug boats that we have- people ask, do we have the intelligence to really know what these drug boats are and who's on them? Yes, we do. That I can say, right. We have multi-source intelligence that- so we know for sure what we're- what we're- what we're actually shooting at, and we don't even shoot at all the targets. And people say, well, why can't you just interdict it all? And I say, well how many boats do you think we have? How many boats and helicopters do you think you have? And you know how risky an interdiction operation is? You're going to people- put people's lives at stake. And you know, we've been doing that for years, and it hasn't worked. So, you do need to try something new, because it is an imminent harm to the United States, and that's clearly within the President's authority under Article Two. So, I don't wring my hands over what's going on right now. Talking hypotheticals about invading Venezuela. I mean, that's not really what we're talking about right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No- no, I was asked about land strikes. But- but let me ask you about something some of your fellow conservatives have been talking quite a lot about including Mitch McConnell, he's been concerned about antisemitism. On the right, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said he's seen more antisemitism in the past six months than in his entire life. Take a listen.",
      "(START SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "SEN. TED CRUZ: \"This is a poison, and I believe we are facing an existential crisis in our party and in our country. ///// If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you are a coward, and you are complicit in that evil.\"",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was specifically referring there to a widely watched interview Tucker Carlson did with far-right commentator and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Do you share Senator Cruz's concern about your party?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Oh, yeah. Mr. Cruz, put it pretty well. I've had a long-standing feud with Tucker Carlson. I'm glad everyone else is- is also waking up now to how bad of a person he is. He's changed a lot over the last 20 years. You know, hard to say why, but it doesn't really matter why. I mean, you have a guy like Fuentes on your show, you're- you're uplifting what is a guy who has really fallen off the radar. You know, he- he used to send his followers to my events and try to ask me a bunch of questions about the Jews and Israel support and all that, and try to disrupt events. And they would try to infiltrate the MAGA movement. You know, they were really on a downhill slide. And for Tucker to have him on- Senator Cruz is exactly right. And this idea that we have to, you know, that it's cancel culture, if we- if we- if we- if we keep Tucker out of our circles from now on, is just nonsense. I literally wrote a book on cancel culture. So, you know, I've thought deeply about this. Cancel culture means you're- you're canceling someone for what is basically a mainstream belief, or maybe- maybe a small, like, honest mistake they made that would be maybe considered cancel culture. It's not cancel culture when you say, look, I want to disassociate myself from you because your beliefs are crazy and you're psychopathic and you're- you are falling apart in front of everyone. You know this disassociation is not canceling anyone, and I know some have suggested it is. So, I think moral- moral clarity is a lot more important in this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Crenshaw, we have to leave it there. Thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. \u00a0Good morning. Good to have you here.",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on this shutdown, we have seen the CEO of all the major airlines come out. The union that represents the air traffic controllers all support the Republican position of just quickly fund the government with a short term clean spending bill. The American Federation of Government Employees also echoing that, AFSA, which represents the diplomats our country has, are coming out and saying that. They're saying in high threat posts they don't have armored vehicles because they can't afford to repair them. Cyber-attacks are up. Consular officers are paying out of pocket to visit ill or incarcerated Americans. Medication shipments aren't arriving, bills aren't being paid. At what point does all of this pain and pressure end the shutdown?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I hope it ends it this week. Frankly, I see it from my folks. I was greeting voters yesterday, we have early- early vote for our gubernatorial election, but I hear people also very angry at this president. I mean, we knew this wasn't going to end unless Donald Trump was back in the country. He's now back in the country. He got to go ahead and put America first and sit down with us, deal with the health care shortage, deal as well- and to show the just cruelty of this administration, there were $6 billion set aside for SNAP benefits. He's had judges say spend that money. We're still waiting to see whether the administration wants to appeal that. Get the money out to people in need, sit down with us, get this resolved this week, and let's get everybody back to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say it's going to end this week, does that mean you're going to see more Democrats cross the aisle and agree to vote for a short term spending bill--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. WARNER: What I think it means is that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --three have.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEN. WARNER: What we've seen from your polling, everything else, it's a pox on both your houses. We got to put this to bed. It's going to require Trump in the room. It's why the bipartisan conversation so far, I don't think we'll ever get to yes, because unfortunately, my Republican colleagues can't move on anything without a Trump sign off. Trump has spent enough time going out there now trying to audition for a Nobel Prize, running around the world. Come back and put America first. Sit down and let's get this resolved. It can be done in an hour using Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, what is the Democratic ask at this point to get that. Because leader Thune said, hey, I'll talk to you about health care open the government first.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Democratic ask is- everyone, as of Saturday, saw health care rates skyrocket. This is an immediate crisis too--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, we've blown past that date of November 1--",
      "SEN. WARNER: They can- we can- but we can deal with this jointly, but it's going to require the active intervention of the President.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning you need to see some sort of negotiation on an extension to government health care subsidies before voting to reopen the government?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen, President Trump has ended up- and I'm a big supporter of Ukraine, has met more with Volodymyr Zelenskyy this year than he's met with any Democrat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the ask is the meeting?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The meeting is, let's sit down and resolve it. I can't believe Donald Trump, the great deal maker of deal makers- who at least how he presents himself, sitting down with us, we couldn't reach an agreement in an hour.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, what I hear you saying is, you are not willing to cross the aisle for an immediate, short term funding bill that is clean. You still need a negotiation over health care.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again. The President of the United States has said when he was not President that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's- stopped his many international trips, come sit down and let's get this resolved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's been outreach, or there hasn't been outreach?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There's lots of conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you say you're optimistic- or would you say you're optimistic about it after this week?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think as- what your poll indicated, people are pox on both your houses at this point, get the darn thing open. Deal with the health care cliff. Don't let people go hungry when we've got money set aside on SNAP. That can all be accomplished, sooner the better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking about those food stamps later in the program. I want to ask you about your national security portfolio. Just overnight, there was another US strike on an alleged drug boat. I know you have been concerned that Democrats are being excluded, particularly from a key meeting that happened this past week with only Republicans in the room. Secretary Hegseth was asked shortly after your press conference by our Ellee Watson of CBS about his plans to share evidence with Congress. Take a listen.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PETE HEGSETH: We are presenting it to Congress. We have time and time again on a bipartisan basis they have been given the evidence directly.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says it's been given. So is your complaint that the evidence is not sufficient, or you disagree with the--",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Secretary of Defense doesn't tell the truth on this matter, we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written. We had been promised it time and again. The Secretary of State, my former colleague and friend, Marco Rubio, looked me in the eye nine days ago and said, Mark, you're going to get it right away. We still didn't get the legal opinion. And then a group of random Republican senators was shared on a partisan basis what is the President's understanding of why these- why it's legal to take these actions. That- you know Margaret, that is not the way the system is supposed to work. When you further partisan national security- when we're putting troops in harm's way. I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the administration says this isn't about war powers that the President has has authorities under Title Two. But let me read to you, because the White House knew you were coming on, they reached out to us yesterday to assert they've provided six bipartisan briefings to members or staff, including your staff, plus the Gang of Eight. A senior Administration official also said classified documents were made available.",
      "SEN. WARNER: There were no classified documents made available to the Gang of Eight members until after a partisan briefing was made to Republicans only. That is not the way our system is supposed to work. If you want to put Americans in harm's way, it needs to be done on a bipartisan basis. My Republican colleagues, many of them afterwards, said, oh yeah, that was not really good. Well, I wish they would have got up and walked out of the damn room, because everyone knows partisanship should not be involved in these national security matters, particularly when we're putting our soldiers and sailors in harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it wasn't just you. The Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican and his Democratic colleague, Jack Reed, said they have twice written to Secretary Hegseth, asking for execute orders specifically legal justifications and the list of terror organizations tied to these strikes. They don't have that information, and they have oversight of the military.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I rest my case. This is what we're all saying, come clean. And the fact is, if, as the administration says, these are all bad guys, and yeah, they're all drugs on these boats, interdict these boats and show the world. Listen the Maduro government in Venezuela. And by the way, none of- none of this legal opinion has anything to do with the Venezuelan Government, Maduro is a bad guy. We should have pushed harder on him when the people of Venezuela voted him out under President Biden. Biden didn't do enough. The drugs are all cocaine it has nothing to do with fentanyl. If you are going to try to make a case to the American public, make it publicly, don't do this and then try to hide the legal justification and give it out only on a partisan basis?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does your Republican colleague, the Chair of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton, hear you on this? Is he working with you on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: To his credit, he did not attend this Republican only briefing that took place earlier this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And neither did Roger Wicker, Armed Services--",
      "SEN. WARNER: --the notion here is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the White House and the Republicans are in disagreement on this.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, there is not a lack of disagreement from members of the Senate that we've been asking for this legal justification for months, and they are now hiding the ball and only giving it out on a partisan basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Warner, thank you for your time today.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We go now to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY:\u00a0 Hey, thanks, Margaret, good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down, you'll see delays, we'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe. But we have to be honest, when we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't- we don't want crashes, we want people to go safely, and so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80% of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports, and that same day, there was a near miss at LaGuardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one. Was that pilot error? Or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago, three hour delays throughout New York. And again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And usually, when these planes are- are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers, it's usually pilot error. But again, I'll have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers. But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So if this shutdown continues, how- when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at LA, in Dallas, in DC, Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who, some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money, and they're now confronted, they haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions. I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers. Margaret, it's really important, I think you've covered this, we don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money like seems to be getting found for others, like the military, to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I think that's a great question. So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open air monuments in Washington, DC, and were shutting down parks just walking paths. President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law. And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine, that's fair. But again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis. And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether. So practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part time work elsewhere?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, I'm clearly asking them, come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid. But as I've traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family, everyone watching your show today as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life? And so they're- at the- next week, they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work. That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret, these are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians, also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational. They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system. We have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers, but I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people all the while they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Understood. So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work and that they may be let go.\" There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, so when- we're 2-3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I've tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy. Margaret, we're up 20% of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers. And so as- when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less. And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed in that we don't have enough controllers in our system, and this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long term consequences--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control. No, listen, I have, no, I- again when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 All right. Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

Melissa made landfall in southwest Jamaica on Tuesday as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph.",

      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The State Department's most recent religious freedom reports cover 2023 and were released last year under the Biden administration. These reports, like others on broader human rights and human trafficking, cover the previous calendar year and are often late in being submitted.",
      "The designation comes after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been trying to rally fellow evangelical Christians to urge Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "summary": "Prime Minister Mark Carney also told Ontario's Premier Doug Ford not to run the ad.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he told Ontario's premier not to run an anti-tariff ad that prompted President Trump to\u00a0end trade talks with Canada.",
      "Carney also confirmed that he apologized to the president during a dinner at\u00a0the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this week because Mr. Trump was \"offended.\"",
      "Ontario's television advertisement that aired in the U.S. criticizes Mr. Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S.\u00a0President Ronald Reagan.",
      "The ad infuriated Mr. Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%.",
      "When asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford's response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, \"Well, you saw what came of it.\"",
      "\"It's not something I would have done,\" Carney added at a news conference as he wrapped a nine-day trip to Asia.",
      "Ford is a populist Conservative, while Carney is a Liberal. As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a U.S. governor.",
      "\"I'm the one who is responsible, in my role as prime minister, for the relationship with the president of the U.S., and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the U.S. government,\" Carney said.",
      "A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond when asked if Carney told Ford not to run the ad.",
      "Ford previously said Carney and Carney's chief of staff watched the ad before it was released.",
      "Ford pulled the ad last Monday but allowed it to be shown in the first two games of the World Series, where the Toronto Blue Jays are playing the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Mr. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad, spelling out the case against them, saying tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan\u00a0said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "Mr. Trump has complained that the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.",
      "Carney met with Mr. Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminum. Tariffs are taking a toll on the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.",
      "More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.",
      "On Wednesday, the Senate voted to approve a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada. In a 50 to 40 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",

      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",

      "Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.",
      "Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the \"Nido 7 Geisha\" beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama's Baru volcano.",

      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",

    "story": [
      "None of the French crown jewels stolen in the brazen daytime robbery of the landmark Louvre Museum had been located 10 days after the heist, the Paris prosecutor said Wednesday, and\u00a0two suspects detained so far\u00a0were formally charged with theft and conspiracy to commit a crime.",
      "\"I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation,\" Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told reporters.",
      "She said the two suspects, who were arrested Saturday, partially admitted to a role in the heist.",
      "The jewels date back hundreds of years and are considered national treasures with an estimated value of some $102 million. Experts have told CBS News the elaborate pieces of jewelry may have already been broken down into their component parts, greatly diminishing their value, and they may never be found.",
      "At least four people in total were seen on security camera video taking part in the robbery on Oct. 19, and Beccuau said at a news conference in the French capital on Wednesday afternoon that her office could not rule out the culprits being part of a larger criminal gang.",
      "Dozens of detectives have been on the trail of the four thieves, who used a cherry picker lift and cutting gear to break into a first-floor gallery at the world-renowned museum and then fled with the jewels.",

      "The two men charged in connection with the heist will remain in custody and await a trial.",
      "A source close to the case this weekend said the men in their 30s were known to the police for committing thefts, and Beccuau said they were believed to be the ones who actually broke into the museum gallery, based, in part, on DNA evidence.",
      "The two men hailed from Seine-Saint-Denis, a region just outside Paris, and one was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria, the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",

      "Recent studies have shown that even if you feel healthy and fit, your immune system could be aging quicker than you think, which could increase the risk of infections and immune-related disorders.",
      "\"Immune aging, like all aging, means that our immune systems start to slow down, make more mistakes and be less effective at protecting us from infection as we get older,\" Chris Rhodes, Ph.D., a nutritional biochemist and longevity expert in California, told Fox News Digital.",
      "When the immune system ages, immune cells become less able to perform crucial functions like fighting infection, destroying cancer cells and healing wounds, according to Rhodes, who is also the CEO and co-founder of Mimio Health in San Francisco.",
      "SCIENTISTS UNCOVER HOW SOME 80-YEAR-OLDS HAVE THE MEMORY OF 50-YEAR-OLDS",
      "\"After the age of 35, our immune systems become less and less able to adapt to new antigens, allergens and other inflammatory stimuli \u2014 and our thymus, the organ responsible for producing T-cells, gradually shrinks, meaning our immunity and ability to respond to new infections becomes more compromised with age,\" the doctor added.",
      "Inflammation is a key driver of declining immune function, leading to what many experts call \"inflammaging.\"",
      "While most people begin to experience \"measurable immune decline\" by their late 30s to early 40s, making certain lifestyle changes and boosting metabolic health can significantly delay it, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"Low-grade inflammation accelerates many age-related diseases, from cardiovascular disease to neurodegeneration,\" Dr. Pooja Gidwani, a double board-certified doctor of internal medicine and obesity medicine in Los Angeles, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Signs of an aging immune system",
      "Some signs that the immune system is slowing down include increased infections or colds, slower wound healing and diminished recovery from exercise or injury, according to Rhodes.",
      "Fatigue, joint stiffness, aches and pains, recurrent viral flare-ups and a weaker vaccine response could also indicate a declining immune system.",
      "5 ways to slow down immune aging",
      "While most people begin to experience \"measurable immune decline\" by their late 30s to early 40s, making certain lifestyle changes and boosting metabolic health can significantly delay it, according to Gidwani.",
      "\"A youthful immune system isn\u2019t about never getting sick \u2014 it\u2019s about recovering quickly, regulating inflammation effectively, and preserving the energy and cognitive clarity that define long-term vitality,\" she said.",
      "7 STEPS TO \u2018SUPER-AGING\u2019 ARE KEY TO LIVING A LONGER, MORE FULFILLING LIFE, EXPERTS SAY",
      "The experts shared the below strategies for slowing down immune system aging.",
      "Gidwani emphasizes the importance of nutrient diversity, not just healthy eating. She recommends incorporating a variety of plants, proteins and healthy fats daily.",
      "\"A wide variety of polyphenols, fibers and omega-3 fats nourishes the gut microbiome, which trains and regulates immune cells,\" she said. \"Because roughly 70% of immune tissue resides in the gut, microbial diversity directly predicts immune resilience.\"",
      "When the immune system ages, immune cells become less able to perform crucial functions like fighting infection, destroying cancer cells and healing wounds. (iStock)",
      "Diet plays an \"enormous role\" in immune functionality and longevity, according to Rhodes, as the effects of certain foods can boost inflammation and lead to immune system stress. Over time, this can promote autoimmune disorders, contribute to disease progression and decrease longevity.",
      "\"The best way to keep your immune system youthful and happy is to focus on a diet rich in antioxidants, polyphenols and plant bioactives that have anti-inflammatory effects, as well as whole foods that avoid the glucose and lipid spikes that promote inflammation,\" he advised.",
      "Diet plays an \"enormous role\" in immune functionality and longevity.",
      "Rhodes also recommends considering intermittent fasting to minimize the time the body spends in the \"post-prandial (post-eating) state\" and to benefit from \"powerful anti-inflammatory effects.\"",
      "Lack of sleep and chronic stress can cause immune cells to be more worn out, less effective at their jobs and more prone to making mistakes, according to Rhodes.",
      "\"Increases in cortisol caused by lack of sleep or high stress levels will promote immune system activation, which can be beneficial in the short term to avoid infection, but will lead to accelerated immune cell aging and less effective functionality over time,\" he warned.",
      "Experts recommend incorporating a variety of plants, proteins and healthy fats daily to boost immune function. (iStock)",
      "\"Ultimately, chronic activation of the immune system due to lack of sleep and high stress will burn out your immune cells faster and accelerate their aging.\"",
      "Sleep is the ultimate \"immune modulator,\" Gidwani said, as even one night of deprivation can cut \"natural-killer-cell activity\" by up to 70%.",

      "She recommends getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep nightly and cultivating a stable circadian rhythm.",
      "Finding \"intentional\" ways to manage stress \u2014 such as journaling, meditating and spending time outdoors \u2014 can also help boost immunity.",
      "Exercise is known to strengthen immunity by lowering stress hormones, reducing chronic inflammation and helping immune cells move through the body.",
      "Rhodes cautioned, however, that while exercise is essential to promoting long-term health and longevity, it can also be \"pro-inflammatory,\" as the damage done to the muscle during exercise also activates the immune system and causes inflammation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"High-impact and intense-burst exercise like sprinting, HIIT training or heavy weight lifting will be the most inflammatory, as these typically cause the highest level of acute muscle and joint stress and promote cellular growth pathways associated with aging,\" he said.",
      "Exercise is known to strengthen immunity by lowering stress hormones, reducing chronic inflammation and helping immune cells move through the body. (Edward Bock)",
      "Low-impact endurance exercise, like marathon running, hiking, swimming or biking, will typically cause less inflammation over time, helping to keep the immune system \"functional and fresh\" in the long term, Rhodes advised.",

      "\"Consistent, moderate exercise enhances mitochondrial function and lymphatic flow, improving immune surveillance without promoting inflammation,\" she said.",

      "\"Core nutrients like vitamin D, magnesium, zinc and omega-3s remain foundational,\" she said. \"Beyond that, NAD\u207a boosters, senolytic compounds and select peptides \u2014 such as thymosin alpha-1 for immune modulation and BPC-157 for tissue repair \u2014 are promising adjuncts for supporting repair and lowering chronic inflammation.\"",
      "\"Most people begin to experience measurable immune decline by their late 30s to early 40s, but lifestyle and metabolic health can delay it significantly.\"",
      "The doctor noted, however, that these supplements should complement, not replace, healthy lifestyle behaviors.",
      "Rhodes suggested that while some vitamins and supplements are critical to immune function, the importance of these \"has often been overhyped.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "\"While the immune system needs essential vitamins, minerals, proteins and fatty acids to function properly, taking high doses of these micronutrients will typically not add any additional benefit beyond avoiding deficiencies,\" he said.",
      "Some of the best supplements to take are those with anti-inflammatory effects, Rhodes said.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"These can be compounds like EGCG from green tea, omega-3 fatty acids, anthocyanins from berries, and biomimetics like palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) that recreate the body\u2019s natural anti-inflammatory signaling.\"",

      "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) \u2014 often nicknamed the \"fountain of youth\" \u2014 is a coenzyme that is essential for cellular survival. (iStock)",
      "Previous research has shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit \"notably low levels\" of NAD+, the researchers noted \u2014 which aligns with the fact that NAD+ declines with age.",
      "\"NAD+ may hold the key to healthier aging and could protect us against diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,\" said Evandro Fei Fang-Stavem, an associate professor at the University of Oslo, in a press release. \"However, we need further research on how to effectively utilize NAD+ in patient treatment.\"",
      "Benefits of NAD+",
      "Research has shown that boosting NAD+ can improve mitochondrial and stem cell function, improve energy metabolism, enhance focus and mood, and support tissue repair, according to Dr. Amanda Kahn, a board-certified internist and longevity expert in New York City.",
      "\"From a longevity standpoint, NAD+ is one of the most central molecules in maintaining youthful cellular function,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"It activates \u2026 longevity pathways that protect against DNA damage and inflammation.\"",
      "ONE OVERLOOKED DAILY HABIT COULD SLOW THE AGING PROCESS, RESEARCHERS SAY",

      "Dr. Halland Chen, a double board-certified physician in New York who specializes in longevity, reiterated that studies in both animals and early human models show that maintaining healthy NAD+ levels can improve energy metabolism, cognitive function and overall vitality.",
      "\"Restoring NAD+ is ultimately about cellular repair and mitochondrial optimization, not just an energy boost,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance, while supporting detoxification and reducing oxidative stress from daily life, travel or poor sleep.\"",
      "COMMON DAILY VITAMIN SHOWN TO SLOW AGING PROCESS OVER FOUR-YEAR PERIOD",
      "NAD+ also activates sirtuins, a group of longevity-related proteins that regulate DNA repair, cellular stress responses and gene expression, Chen said, although he noted that larger human studies are still needed.",
      "Methods of boosting NAD+",
      "In clinical studies, patients with age-related diseases have taken compounds designed to boost NAD+.",
      "While NAD+ itself is a large molecule that can\u2019t cross into cells, NAD+ \"precursors\" can enter cells and then work to create NAD+, experts confirm.",
      "These precursors include nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Most people take these NAD+ precursors in the form of pills, capsules or powders.",
      "\"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance while supporting detoxification.\"",
      "\"Oral NAD precursors can modestly raise NAD+ levels and are convenient for daily maintenance,\" Kahn said. \"In contrast, injections or IV infusions bypass the gut and deliver NAD+ directly into circulation, leading to more rapid and noticeable effects on energy, focus and recovery.\"",
      "Kahn also prescribes a weaker NAD+ nasal spray for patients who can\u2019t tolerate needles, though she said the benefits are typically less pronounced.",

      "\"In general, I find that combining daily oral precursors with weekly NAD+ injections offers the most comprehensive support for both intracellular and extracellular NAD stores,\" she advised.",
      "Chen noted that oral supplements are best for maintenance, while IV therapy is often chosen for a \"rapid cellular reboot, post-travel recovery or enhanced performance.\"",

      "A doctor noted that oral supplements are best for maintenance, while IV therapy is often chosen for a \"rapid cellular reboot, post-travel recovery or enhanced performance.\" (iStock)",
      "NAD+ therapy tends to have the most benefit for those managing fatigue, metabolic dysfunction or neurological decline, as well as anyone seeking to enhance energy, focus and recovery, Chen said.",
      "\"In healthy adults, benefits are typically modest, but can be amplified when combined with optimized nutrition, exercise and sleep,\" he added.",

      "Kahn noted that common side effects include mild redness, itching or tenderness at the injection site, \"which is harmless and dissipates quickly.\"",
      "\"Some patients notice a transient rush, lasting no more than 10 minutes, after taking an NAD+ injection due to a brief release of adrenaline and mitochondrial ATP,\" she went on. \"While not dangerous, it can feel uncomfortable if not anticipated.\"",
      "\"If the core pillars \u2014 sleep, movement, nutrition, metabolic balance and stress regulation \u2014 are not in place, NAD+ therapy won\u2019t deliver its full potential.\"",
      "When choosing a NAD+ product, quality matters more than quantity, according to multiple experts.",
      "\"Patients should look for clinically validated, third-party-tested formulations and start with lower doses to gauge tolerance,\" Chen said.",

The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",

      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services.

      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites.

Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise.

      "5) Digital footprint",
      "The trail your child leaves behind",
      "Every post, comment or photo shared online becomes part of your child's digital footprint, a permanent record of their online presence. Even deleted posts can live on through screenshots, data archives or algorithms.",
      "Why it matters: Colleges, employers and even peers can access public digital traces. Teaching kids to think before posting helps them build a positive and professional online reputation.",

      "Pro tip:\u00a0You can also set up Google Alerts for your child's name to get notified whenever new content appears online, a simple, free way to stay aware of their digital footprint as it evolves.",
      "Also, you may want to consider using a data removal service to help clean up your child's personal information that may appear on people-search sites or data-broker platforms. These tools scan the web for outdated profiles, cached pages and databases containing sensitive details like addresses, phone numbers and photos. They can automatically submit takedown requests and continue monitoring for new exposures over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "The dark web often feels like a mystery, hidden beneath the surface of the internet that most people use every day. But to understand how scams and cybercrimes actually work, you need to know what happens in those hidden corners where criminals trade data, services and stolen access.",
      "Cybercriminals rely on a structured underground economy, complete with marketplaces, rules and even dispute systems to operate safely away from law enforcement. By learning how these systems function, you can better understand the threats that could reach you and avoid becoming the next target.",

      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Learn how to protect your personal information from dark web threats with simple cybersecurity habits and tools. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the hidden layers of the internet",
      "The internet is often divided into three layers: the clear web, the deep web and the dark web. The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "From password managers to antivirus software, experts share practical ways to keep hackers out of your data. (Annette Riedl/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "A growing number of companies specialize in removing your personal data from online databases and people search sites. These platforms often collect and publish names, addresses, phone numbers and even family details without consent, creating easy targets for scammers and identity thieves.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The dark web thrives on the idea that anonymity equals safety. But while criminals may feel protected, law enforcement and security researchers continue to monitor and infiltrate these spaces. Over the years, many large marketplaces have been dismantled, and hundreds of operators have been caught despite their layers of encryption. The takeaway for everyone else is that the more you understand how these underground systems function, the better prepared you are to recognize warning signs and protect yourself.",

      "LIVING IN GIANT MOON GLASS SPHERES COULD BE OUR FUTURE",
      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",
      "The mission will also test Google's Gemma language model in orbit. It will be the first time a large AI model operates in space.",
      "THE NEW ARMS RACE IS FOR COMPUTE \u2014 AND AMERICA CAN\u2019T AFFORD TO FALL BEHIND",
      "By processing satellite data in orbit, Starcloud hopes to make Earth monitoring faster and more efficient. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Starcloud plans to build space data centers",
      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",
      "Space-based data centers could also speed up disaster response, improve weather forecasts and save millions of gallons of water every year. The idea shows that innovation and sustainability can grow together.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sending an NVIDIA GPU into orbit shows how quickly technology is changing. The mission combines curiosity, innovation and a genuine push to make computing cleaner and faster. As space becomes more reachable, the idea of data centers floating above Earth feels less like fiction and more like something that could actually happen. Each of these missions could teach us a little more about how to build a sustainable digital future.",

      "Why are unsupported systems dangerous",
      "Unsupported Windows 10 systems no longer get the updates that keep you safe. Without those patches, ransomware and malware have easy access to your files. Once inside, attackers can encrypt your personal data or steal credentials and banking details.",
      "It's not just about losing files. Identity theft and financial fraud often start with outdated systems. The older the software, the easier it is for cybercriminals to exploit weaknesses that will never be fixed.",
      "The \"just one more year\" trap",
      "Many people tell themselves they'll upgrade later. Microsoft calls this \"just one more year\" thinking. The problem is that every delay increases your risk. Extended security updates only offer limited coverage, and they don't stop new types of attacks.",
      "Without Microsoft's regular monitoring, new vulnerabilities stay hidden. You could be using your computer for months while attackers quietly collect your data. That's a frightening thought, especially when most of it can be prevented by upgrading.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Start by checking whether your PC can handle Windows 11. Most modern AMD and Intel processors already meet the system requirements. Upgrading keeps your computer protected with ongoing updates that patch vulnerabilities and improve overall performance. It's one of the simplest ways to defend against ransomware and malware before they strike.",
      "Be cautious with every link and attachment you receive. Cybercriminals love sending fake update notifications that look like official Microsoft messages. These phishing scams often contain malicious links that install malware in seconds. Before you click, hover over links to verify their source and only download updates directly from Microsoft's official site. To add an extra layer of protection, install strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious files before they infect your system.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.

      "Researchers say the data contains both old and newly discovered credentials. Hunt confirmed that 91% of the data had appeared in previous breaches, but about 16.4 million email addresses were completely new to any known dataset.",

      "Cyber experts uncovered a 3.5-terabyte data dump containing millions of stolen logins. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The real risk behind the password leak",
      "The leak puts millions of users at risk. Hackers often collect stolen logins from multiple sources and combine them into large databases that circulate on dark web forums, Telegram channels and Discord servers.",
      "If you have reused passwords across multiple sites, attackers can use this data to break into your accounts through credential stuffing. This method tests stolen username and password pairs on many different platforms.",
      "The risk remains real for anyone using old or repeated credentials. One compromised password can unlock social media, banking and cloud accounts.",
      "GOOGLE CONFIRMS DATA STOLEN IN BREACH BY KNOWN HACKER GROUP",
      "Researcher Troy Hunt traced the leak to malware that secretly steals passwords from infected devices. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Google responds to the reports",
      "Google confirmed there was no Gmail data breach. In a post on X, the company stated \"reports of a Gmail security breach impacting millions of users are false. Gmail\u2019s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.\"",
      "Google clarified that the leak came from infostealer databases that compile years of stolen credentials from across the web. These databases are often mistaken for new breaches when, in fact, they represent ongoing theft activity. Troy Hunt also confirmed the dataset originated from Synthient\u2019s collection of infostealer logs, not from a single platform or recent attack. While no new breach occurred, experts warn that leaked credentials remain dangerous because cybercriminals reuse them for future attacks.",
      "How to check if you were exposed",
      "To see if your email was affected, visit\u00a0Have I Been Pwned. It is the first and official source for this newly added dataset. Enter your email address to find out if your information appears in the Synthient leak.",
      "Many password managers also include built-in breach scanners that use the same data sources. However, they may not yet include this new collection until their databases update.",
      "If your address shows up, treat it as compromised. Change your passwords immediately and turn on stronger security features to protect your accounts.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "The 183 million exposed credentials came from malware, phishing and old data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "9 steps to protect yourself now",
      "Protecting your online life starts with consistent action. Each step below adds another layer of defense against hackers, malware and credential theft.",
      "Start with your most important accounts, such as email and banking. Use strong, unique passwords with letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid predictable choices like names or birthdays.",
      "Never reuse passwords. One stolen password can unlock multiple accounts. Each login should be unique to protect your data.",
      "A password manager makes this simple. It stores complex passwords securely and helps you create new ones. Many managers also scan for breaches to see if your current passwords have been exposed.",
      "Next, check whether your email has been caught in a recent credential leak. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in Breach Scanner that searches trusted databases, including the newly added Synthient data from\u00a0Have I Been Pwned. It helps you find out if your email or passwords have appeared in any known leaks. If you see a match, change any reused passwords right away and secure those accounts with strong, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Turn on 2FA wherever possible. It adds a powerful second layer of defense that blocks intruders even if they have your password. You will receive a code by text, app or security key. That code ensures only you can log in to your accounts.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. It's a smart way to stay one step ahead of hackers.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Infostealer malware hides inside fake downloads and phishing attachments. A strong antivirus software scans your devices to stop threats before they spread. Keep your antivirus updated and run frequent scans. Even one unprotected device can put your whole digital life at risk.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Browsers are convenient but risky. Infostealer malware often targets saved passwords in your web browser.",
      "Updates fix security flaws that hackers exploit. Turn on automatic updates for your operating system, antivirus and apps. Staying current keeps threats out.",
      "Avoid unknown websites that offer free downloads. Fake apps and files often contain hidden malware. Use official app stores or verified company websites.",
      "Check your accounts regularly for unusual logins or device connections. Many platforms show a login history. If something looks off, change your password and enable\u00a02FA immediately.",
      "The massive leak of 183 million credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today's threat landscape.",

    "story": [
      "Driverless semitrucks raise questions about safety, reliability and the future of the trucking industry.",
      "A new safety evaluation shows the Kodiak Driver, an autonomous system from Kodiak AI, tied for the top safety score among more than 1,000 commercial fleets run by human drivers. The evaluation came from Nauto, Inc., creator of the Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment, or VERA Score. This system uses AI to measure fleet safety on a scale of 1 to 100.",
      "The Kodiak Driver earned a remarkable score of 98. That result placed it beside the safest human fleets in Nauto's global network. The findings sparked discussion across the trucking industry and raised new questions about the role of automation in freight transport.",

      "WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?",
      "The Kodiak Driver, an autonomous trucking system powered by AI, earned a top VERA Score of 98 in a new safety evaluation. (Kodiak)",
      "Kodiak Driver's autonomous truck safety evaluation results",
      "Kodiak's VERA Score of 98 matched the highest rating among all fleets evaluated. Fleets with Nauto's safety technology average a score of 78, while those without the technology average only 63.",
      "The Kodiak Driver achieved perfect scores of 100 in inattentive driving, high-risk driving and traffic violations. Its lowest score, 95, came in aggressive driving. The VERA Score combines over 20 vision-based AI variables into one clear safety rating.",
      "Nauto found that every 10-point increase in VERA Score cuts collision risk by about 21%. A near-perfect score like Kodiak's represents a strong improvement over typical human performance on the road.",
      "The strong results didn't come as a surprise to Kodiak's leadership. Don Burnette, founder and CEO of Kodiak, told CyberGuy: \"Achieving the top safety score among more than 1,000 commercial fleets in Nauto's Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment (VERA Score\u00ae) proprietary safety benchmark is a testament to the Kodiak's focus on safety. Safety is at the foundation of everything Kodiak builds. Our core value is \u2018safety first and always.\u2019 We believe independent safety evaluations like Nauto's help to validate what we already know: the Kodiak Driver is already among the safest drivers on American highways. They also help to establish and build public awareness around how safe our technology truly is.\"",
      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: TRUMP, MUSK AIM FOR DOMINANCE",
      "The growing impact of AI on truck driving safety",
      "Nauto equipped the trucks with advanced monitoring and hazard detection systems. These tools track both the driving environment and vehicle behavior in real time. Removing human factors such as distraction, fatigue and delayed reaction directly improves safety.",
      "Burnette said in a company statement that the system \"is never drowsy, never drunk, and always paying attention.\" That constant awareness allows the Kodiak Driver to operate defensively and predictably, two traits linked to safe driving.",
      "The VERA Score also gives fleets a consistent way to measure safety. Companies can now shift from reacting to crashes to preventing them.",
      "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration data support the trend. U.S. commercial truck crashes dropped from more than 124,000 in 2024 to roughly 104,000 this year. Fewer crashes mean fewer fatalities and safer highways overall.",
      "Kodiak\u2019s self-driving trucks combine AI vision and real-time data to reduce risky behavior and improve on-road performance. (Kodiak)",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Concerns about autonomous truck safety",
      "Not everyone is ready to hand over the wheel to artificial intelligence. Some industry experts point out that while systems like the Kodiak Driver perform well in controlled evaluations, real-world roads can still pose unpredictable challenges. Weather, human drivers and mechanical issues remain complex variables for autonomous systems to manage.",
      "Others worry about the impact on jobs. As AI takes on more driving responsibilities, professional drivers wonder what the shift will mean for employment and pay across the trucking industry.",
      "Safety advocates also call for clearer regulations and public transparency.",
      "Even supporters of the technology agree that continued oversight, testing and gradual rollout are essential. Progress is promising, but trust takes time.",
      "AI DRONE FINDS MISSING HIKER'S REMAINS IN MOUNTAINS AFTER 10 MONTHS",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you work in logistics, fleet management or transportation tech, this news hits close to home. The Kodiak Driver's near-perfect score proves that autonomous systems aren't just catching up to human drivers; they're starting to edge ahead in safety.",
      "Businesses could see big gains. AI-powered safety tools help cut liability, lower costs and keep fleets running smoothly. The technology doesn't need rest breaks or reminders to stay focused, which makes every mile more efficient.",
      "Regulators are also paying attention. Verified data like this builds trust and clears the way for safer, wider use of autonomous trucks. It's proof that technology can deliver real-world safety, not just promise it.",
      "Drivers on everyday roads benefit too. Fewer crashes mean safer highways and more reliable deliveries. When trucks drive smarter, everyone shares the reward. Human drivers aren't going anywhere soon, but AI is quickly becoming their most reliable partner. It helps prevent fatigue, distraction and those risky split-second decisions that lead to trouble.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This study marks a major step in redefining what safe driving means. An autonomous system equaling the best human fleets signals that automation is moving from theory to reality. Still, the shift raises questions. How soon will public trust catch up with technology? Can regulations evolve fast enough to support widespread adoption? Will drivers adapt to sharing the road with machines that never tire or lose focus? What remains certain is that safety innovation is transforming transportation. Autonomous systems like the Kodiak Driver are proving that technology and safety can move forward together.",

      "Right now, if you're over 50, you can make extra contributions to your 401(k) on top of the standard annual limit ($23,500 in 2025). These \"catch-up\" contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning the money comes out of your paycheck before tax and grows tax-free until retirement.",
      "But starting in 2026, for anyone earning more than $145,000 in the previous year, these catch-up contributions will no longer be tax-deferred. Instead, they'll become like the Roth 401(k), meaning you pay taxes on the money now, but it grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.",

      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",

      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

    "story": [
      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera.

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Commissioner Amelia Powers Gardner, one of three elected county commissioners who oversee policy, operations and finances, said Utah County has already spent \"just over a quarter of a million dollars\" on the case, a figure expected to double by year\u2019s end and could reach around $5 million over the next year and a half.",
      "\"Under the Constitution, we have a right to a competent defense,\" Powers Gardner said. \"It is imperative that if we want to have a society that we believe in justice, that justice needs to be fair and equal.\"",
      "She said she\u2019s heard from constituents who are frustrated that taxpayer dollars will fund his defense. Still, she emphasized the county\u2019s constitutional duty and the financial wisdom of ensuring a fair trial, especially in a potential death-penalty case.",

      "Powers Gardner said part of her role is keeping the community united after a tragedy that affected residents across political lines.",
      "\"My job is also to be a leader for my community, and that\u2019s what I have focused on,\" she said. \"You have to keep in mind, not everybody who was traumatized that day was a Charlie Kirk supporter. There were hundreds of people there that were protesting at that event and were just as traumatized that they saw a father and husband murdered.\"",
      "\"Our community had a horrific event take place, and that horrific event has affected people across party and ideological lines. Our job in local government is not to play politics, but to take care of all of our citizens \u2014 the ones that voted for me and the ones that didn\u2019t. They\u2019re still my constituents, and I work hard for them.\"",
      "The judge deemed Robinson eligible for public defense, requiring the county to hire a death-penalty-certified team after all local attorneys declined the county\u2019s standard contract.",
      "\"Because it is Charlie Kirk, we sent out that standard contract and got zero attorneys who were willing to take the case for our standard contract,\" Powers Gardner said. \"It's a very emotionally and politically charged case. And because of that, none of our usual defense attorneys were willing to take the case.\"",
      "She added that due to this being a \"very high profile case,\" most of their usual contracts were not valid.",

And appeals mean more money and more time. It\u2019s actually the most prudent use of taxpayer dollars to give Tyler Robinson a competent defense the first time.\"",

      "The administration said that it would use all $4.65 billion in contingency funds, which will cover about half of each eligible household's benefits this month.",
      "The administration said it would need at least $4 billion in additional government funds to provide full SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps.",
      "While the administration said it considered using funds from the Agriculture Department's Section 32 funds, the White House ultimately decided that those funds \u201cmust remain available to protect full operation of Child Nutrition Programs throughout the fiscal year, instead of being used for SNAP benefits.\u201d",
      "\u201cSection 32 Child Nutrition Program funds are not a contingency fund for SNAP,\u201d said the filing, which was signed by Agriculture Department Under Secretary Patrick Penn.",
      "\u201cUsing billions of dollars from Child Nutrition for SNAP would leave an unprecedented gap in Child Nutrition funding that Congress has never had to fill with annual appropriations, and USDA cannot predict what Congress will do under these circumstances,\u201d it said.",
      "The filing noted that because the administration was using the contingency funds, there would be no remaining funds for new SNAP applicants, \u201cdisaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely.\u201d",

      "On Friday, U.S. District Judge John McConnell of Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to make a full SNAP payment by the end of the day Monday or a partial payment by Wednesday. In order to make the full SNAP payment, the administration would have to draw on additional funding sources beyond the contingency reserves.",
      "\u201cThere is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown; in fact, the President during his first term issued guidance indicating that these contingency funds are available if SNAP funds lapse due to a government shutdown,\u201d McConnell wrote in his order, pointing to a 2019 Q&A email written by a SNAP administrator.",

    "story": [
      "Voters say President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are more to blame for the ongoing government shutdown, according to a new NBC News poll. But their verdict on the spending stalemate includes more blame for Democrats than some past shutdowns, part of a growing collection of data outlining negative views of both parties.",
      "The survey, conducted Oct. 24-28, finds a combined 52% of voters blame Trump and congressional Republicans for the stalemate, while 42% blame Democrats in Congress and 4% blame all of the players.",
      "The share of voters who blame Democrats is the highest for the party when compared to other shutdowns or potential shutdowns measured in NBC News polling over the last 30 years.",
      "Meanwhile, voters\u2019 negative views of the Democratic Party, including among Democrats, are relatively unchanged from record-low ratings in the March NBC News poll. The Republican Party is underwater with voters too, though not to the same degree. And in another poll question, voters responded positively to the idea of booting every member of Congress.",
      "At the same time, the poll also finds that both parties\u2019 core supporters are on their side in the shutdown standoff \u2014 perhaps explaining why it has carried on for a month with few signs of a resolution.",
      "The groups most likely to blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown include core Democratic constituencies like self-described liberals, young voters, those in urban areas, Black voters and higher-educated voters. Those blaming Democrats include self-identified MAGA supporters, white men, and rural and older voters.",
      "\u201cEach party could look at this data and say, \u2018Let\u2019s not blink,\u2019\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, who conducted the survey with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.",
      "Neither party has blinked yet, as Democrats oppose government funding bills unless a deal is reached to extend expiring health care subsidies.",
      "\u201cHealth care, a central focus of the government shutdown debate, is an area where Democrats continue to hold the upper hand,\u201d said Horwitt.",
      "The survey also finds 34% of voters say they or someone in their family have seen their employment, services or benefits affected by the shutdown \u2014 the highest share in NBC News polling covering other shutdowns in 2019, 2013, 1996 and 1995.",
      "Those personally affected are also among the voters more likely to blame Republicans for the impasse and align broadly with Democrats, including young women and Black voters, 50% of whom say they have been affected.",
      "\u201cHistorically, Republicans are perceived as not being as supportive of government,\u201d said McInturff, also noting the federal layoffs driven by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency that have driven voter views of his presidency. The Republican pollster added that even though Democratic votes are needed to advance legislation in the Senate thanks to the 60-vote threshold to end debate, voters may broadly view Republicans as controlling the government.",
      "\u201cGiven those factors, I think the default for people is that it\u2019s a Republican effort in terms of who gets the blame. \u2026 We\u2019ve had 30 years of shutdowns, and this is the highest number of blaming Democrats. So both things can be true at the same time,\u201d McInturff said.",
      "Although voters place more blame on Trump and the GOP for the ongoing shutdown, the survey does find a deep well of ill feeling toward both parties, as well as negative views of members of Congress.",
      "Democrats are 25 points underwater, with just 28% of voters viewing the party positively, near a record-low positive rating of 27% in March. A majority of voters (53%) say they have a negative view of the Democratic Party.",
      "Republicans have a net-negative rating of 9 points, with 46% viewing the party negatively and 37% viewing it positively.",
      "And according to these results, Democrats\u2019 shutdown standoff has not boosted views of the party within their own ranks.",
      "The gap between the two parties\u2019 ratings persists in part because 22% of Democrats say they view their own party negatively, while just 8% of Republicans say the same of the GOP. Back in March, 19% of Democrats said they had negative views of their party.",
      "The new poll also finds 59% of Democrats view their own party positively \u2014 unchanged since March. (The remainder said they were neutral or not sure.)",
      "Asked how they would vote if they could choose to defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including their own representatives, 57% of voters say they would vote to do so \u2014 the highest share in NBC News polling since October 2013. Forty percent said they would not oust every member of Congress if given the chance.",
      "Similar shares of Democrats (57%) and Republicans (55%), as well as 62% of independents, say they would vote to replace every lawmaker.",
      "The findings come as more candidates consider primary challenges against sitting lawmakers in the 2026 election cycle and as both parties confront the prospect of generational change following the results of the 2024 election.",
      "The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

      "On Tuesday night, Trump did write on social media that Senate Republicans should use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to get rid of the filibuster. The drastic move would allow Republicans to reopen the government without needing 60 votes \u2014 and the cooperation of Democrats \u2014 but it was swiftly rejected by Republican leaders.",
      "Last week, Trump\u2019s attention was in Asia, far from the pain of the shutdown, with a big announcement on tariffs. Before that, much of his focus was on demolishing the East Wing of the White House to build a $300 million ballroom funded by private donors, a project that is ongoing.",
      "And on Thursday, a reporter asked Vice President JD Vance about the loss of SNAP benefits, and whether the administration was working to find a funding solution, as it has tried to do to pay troops and law enforcement during the shutdown.",
      "Vance avoided answering whether there would be a push around SNAP, instead blaming Democrats.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate reality \u2014 and we\u2019re starting to see this with our aviation industry \u2014 we\u2019re going to find out the hard way with SNAP benefits, the American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,\u201d Vance said.",
      "Some relief could be coming \u2014 but if it does, it\u2019s over the Trump administration\u2019s objections. On Friday, a federal judge ordered the administration to distribute money to SNAP recipients \u201cas soon as possible\u201d by tapping a contingency fund. Another federal judge in a separate case also said it was unlawful for the administration not to pay out the benefits.",
      "The White House has argued that it cannot use those funds and is seeking further clarification from the courts.",
      "Several recent public polls have pointed to Trump having an economic problem, one that is quickly turning into a political one for Republicans trying to maintain slim majorities in the House and Senate headed into the 2026 midterms \u2014 an election where Republicans will have to energize Trump voters without his presence on the ballot.",
      "The new NBC News poll found Republicans have just a 1-point advantage over Democrats on \u201cdealing with the economy,\u201d a margin that has consistently been 15-20 points in favor of Republicans going back to 2018.",
      "Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego\u2019s winning campaign in Arizona last year, said that economic hardship gives his party\u2019s candidates an opening to win key segments of the electorate \u2014 including the young men who helped Trump take back the White House \u2014 if they focus on making the argument that their policies are better than the president\u2019s.",
      "\u201cRight now, people\u2019s prices are going up. Their prices are going up for the utility bills, going up for lots of things in their life, because of the tariffs,\u201d Rocha said. \u201cIf you show up and start talking to folks about actually trying to provide for their family, there\u2019s going to be a lot of men who right now feel a little regret because they were promised lower prices and they\u2019re not getting them.\u201d",
      "Moreno said he was not worried \u201cabout the politics\u201d of the shutdown, noting that he has pledged to serve no more than two Senate terms and, as a native of Colombia, is constitutionally ineligible to be president. But he said Republicans need to better articulate their message: that they hold Democrats responsible for the shutdown and its economic ramifications.",
      "He specifically alluded to recent remarks from House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., who in an interview with Fox News acknowledged that families would \u201csuffer\u201d because of the shutdown but emphasized that Democrats needed to exert their political \u201cleverage\u201d to address health care costs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to speak up more loudly and more aggressively, like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune did the other day. I think we haven\u2019t shown enough outrage. We do it privately, but we haven\u2019t done it enough publicly. Just call these guys out. It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Moreno said.",
      "\u201cWe need to speak clearly, with humanity, not political talk,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump remains popular with Republicans on things like immigration enforcement \u2014 Betty Szretter says she still supports the president on that issue \u2014 but pocketbook issues more often than not have an outsize role in swaying election outcomes.",
      "The NBC News poll found 83% of registered voters said the \u201ccost of living\u201d was their single most important issue or very important to them, a number that was at 58% when they were asked about \u201cimmigration and border security.\u201d",
      "On the Asia trip last week, Trump nevertheless told reporters he had the \u201chighest [poll] numbers I ever had.\u201d",
      "He has also directly avoided questions about the economy.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just make it about this subject,\u201d Trump said at an event centered around an autism announcement last month. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about some nonsense on the economy. I will say this: The economy is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Republicans running in swing House seats across the country, however, have not been eager to talk about Trump\u2019s economy.",
      "NBC News reached out to eight Republicans either defending swing seats they currently hold or challenging Democrats in winnable seats; seven did not return requests seeking comment.",
      "Brinker Harding is a Republican city councilman in Omaha running to replace Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is not seeking re-election in one of the most up-for-grab seats in the country. Harding said he believes that once the midterm campaigns really begin, moves Trump has made will have the economy in a better place.",
      "\u201cCome next November, Republicans\u2019 tax cuts for working families and small businesses, in addition to projected interest rate cuts, will have the American economy moving more than it already is,\u201d he said.",
      "Other swing state Republicans where vulnerable Democrats are on the ballot are pinning economic woes on those Democrats.",
      "\u201cMaine\u2019s issues are especially pronounced on the economic front,\u201d said Lauren LePage, who is the Republican national committeewoman from Maine. \u201cAnd the blame for our high cost of living, nation-leading electricity price increases and more lies at the feet of Democrats here.\u201d",
      "Maine is home to one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched 2026 Senate contests as Democrats try to knock off Republican Sen. Susan Collins. LePage\u2019s father, former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, is himself running to challenge Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, in a House seat that is considered winnable for either party.",
      "Other Republicans, including some former Trump allies, are acknowledging that prices have remained stubbornly high during Trump\u2019s second term in office.",
      "\u201cPrices have not come down at all,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on \u201cThe Tim Dillon Show\u201d last week. \u201cThe job market is extremely difficult. Wages have not gone up.\u201d",
      "She has also made an uncharacteristic pivot in recent weeks. After being one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders, she has been critical of the president and her own party of late, agreeing with Democrats that the Affordable Care Act tax credits should be included as part of any deal to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the point where families are spending anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 a month and looking at hikes coming on their insurance premiums, I think that\u2019s unforgivable,\u201d she told NBC News in early October.",
      "For people like Betty Szretter, they just want the fight to be over and the focus to return to Americans hurting in the current economic climate.",
      "\u201cI would say practice what you preach and save the country as a true servant,\u201d she said when asked what she would say to Trump directly. \u201cThere are not a lot of people who use their wealth to actually help others. Really no one.\u201d"

      "As the government shutdown nears its second month, airports across the country are feeling its impact, with flight delays piling up because of staffing shortages.",
      "This weekend saw the most difficult travel conditions yet at dozens of American airports amid the shutdown, with lines of frustrated travelers appeared endless. More than 5,000 flights traveling from and to U.S. airports were delayed Sunday alone, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it screened nearly 2.7 million people around the country. As the shutdown drags on, more delays and cancellations can be expected, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Air traffic controllers, who are relied on to coordinate aircraft within the airspace and are required to work as essential workers during a government shutdown, have been working without pay. Duffy said he wants them to return to work, adding that those who do not will receive a disappointing paycheck at the end of the week.",
      "\"None of them can miss two paychecks,\" Duffy said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. \"They all start \u2014 their home finances fall apart, and they\u2019re all going to have to look at taking second jobs or quitting and getting into another line of work. And the consequence of that is very real for our air system.\"",
      "Duffy underscored the dire need for air traffic controllers, adding that the system is short anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 controllers.",
      "\"I\u2019m trying to put more air traffic controllers into the system,\" he said.",
      "On Monday afternoon, more than 1,830 flights traveling within, to and out of U.S. airports were delayed, and more than 500 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport account for most of it, with almost 300 delays and 16 cancellations between them.",
      "It is not immediately clear if staffing shortages directly caused the delays and cancellations Monday.",
      "According to recent delay data from the Department of Transportation (DOT), 84% of total delay minutes on Sunday were attributed to staffing. On Saturday, 59% of total delay minutes were attributed to staffing, and 64.8% were on Friday.",
      "\"From January to September 2025 (before the shutdown), only 5% of delays were caused by staffing issues,\" the DOT said.",
      "The unpredictable flight schedule has frustrated travelers. Many are questioning the safety of air travel if control towers are not fully staffed.",
      "Duffy said delays and cancellations are an attempt to make air travel safer.",
      "\"You'll see more delays, you'll see more cancellations of flights, and that\u2019s because we slow traffic down because we don\u2019t have enough controllers in the towers and TRACONs to make sure we can navigate the flights,\" he said, referring to terminal radar approach control facilities. \"So, that\u2019s a tool that we have to keep the system safe.\"",
      "If air travel was unsafe, the DOT would \"shut the whole airspace down,\" Duffy said.",
      "\"We won\u2019t let people travel,\" he said. \"We\u2019re not there at this point. It\u2019s just significant delays.\""

      "Paramount announced the news Monday, putting an end to questions about Stewart's immediate future with the late-night show he originally hosted full-time from 1999 to 2015 before returning last year on a one-night-a-week basis.",
      "\"Jon Stewart continues to elevate the genre he created. His return is an ongoing commitment to the incisive comedy and sharp commentary that define 'The Daily Show,'\u201d Comedy Central head Ari Pearce said in a statement.",

      "It is, in many ways, a quintessentially American unsolved murder mystery.",
      "The victim was a rich and beautiful teenage girl found beaten to death with a golf club in a ritzy and supposedly safe Connecticut suburb. There was national news media frenzy followed by a stymied police investigation. And at the center of it all, there was murder suspect Michael Skakel, who also happens to be related to the fabled Kennedy family.",
      "Eventually, there would be celebrity cameos from another high-profile murder investigation in this unfolding drama.",
      "But 50 years after the 15-year-old was found dead beneath a tree in the backyard of her family home, there still is no definitive answer to the question: Who killed Martha Moxley?",
      "Now, for the first time since his conviction in the killing of Moxley was overturned in 2013, Skakel is speaking at length about the death in Greenwich that sent him to prison for more than 11 years.",
      "\u201cUm, my name is Michael Skakel and why am I being interviewed?\u201d he asks veteran journalist Andrew Goldman in \u201cDead Certain: The Martha Moxley Murder,\u201d NBC News Studios\u2019 new podcast that makes its debut Tuesday. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s kind of a big question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "On several occasions, Skakel and his brother Stephen Skakel were interviewed at the modest rental home they share in Norwalk, Connecticut, which is a far cry from the mansion in which they grew up.",
      "\u201cFor the first half of the 20th century, the Skakels were incalculably rich robber baron rich, a kind of wealth we now associate with the Koch brothers. Certainly richer than the Kennedys,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cNot so anymore.\u201d",
      "The first five episodes of the podcast delve into the history of the murder case that transfixed the country after Moxley was found dead Oct. 31, 1975, setting off a hunt for her killer that continues to this day.",
      "Goldman is not new to the Moxley case; he ghostwrote \u201cFramed: Why Michael Skakel Spent Over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn\u2019t Commit,\u201d a 2016 bestseller by Skakel\u2019s cousin, now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. After finishing his work on the book, Goldman continued to reinvestigate the case on his own for nearly a decade.",
      "But Goldman, in the podcast, admits he wasn\u2019t initially sold on the idea of Skakel being innocent.",
      "\u201cWhen I first met him back in 2015, to be honest, being in the same room with him made me physically uncomfortable,\u201d Goldman says. \u201cThe media coverage of the case had convinced me I was shaking a murderer\u2019s hand.\u201d",
      "Skakel is the fifth of seven children born to Rushton and Anne Skakel, who were fabulously wealthy and ultraconservative Catholics. They were the nieces and nephews of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy. The Skakel children lost their mother to cancer in 1972 and their father struggled with alcoholism.",
      "The family lived across the street from the Moxleys in a Tudor-style mansion.",
      "Moxley was last seen alive Oct. 30, 1975, when she was hanging out with a group of friends that included then 15-year-old Skakel and his older brother Thomas Skakel on Mischief Night, which is the night before Halloween when children roam the neighborhood and pull pranks such as ringing doorbells and toilet-papering trees and yards.",
      "Described by friends as \u201cjoy on legs,\u201d the vivacious teen was found dead the next day in the brush on her family\u2019s property with her pants and underwear pulled down.",
      "An autopsy revealed Moxley had not been sexually assaulted, but had been bludgeoned and stabbed in the neck with a broken six-iron golf club that was traced back to the Skakel home.",
      "Skakel wasn\u2019t the first person police suspected of killing Moxley. Thomas Skakel landed on investigators\u2019 radar well before him because he was seen flirting with her before she died. Later, police focused on the Skakel children\u2019s live-in tutor, Kenneth Littleton. Neither were charged with a crime.",
      "Skakel said in the podcast that his life was a horror show before Moxley died.",
      "Skakel said his father beat him at age 9 when he found him with some Playboy magazines and often beat him for no reason at all.",
      "\u201cHe was about as Orthodox Catholic as it got,\u201d Skakel said of his father. \u201cI just never knew when it was going to happen. I didn\u2019t know why it happened.\u201d",
      "During Skakel's sentencing hearing in 2002, his lawyer submitted 90 letters from people close to him that included details of abuse he allegedly suffered at the hands of his father.",
      "Skakel said his mother was cold and left most of the child-rearing to the household help. When he broke his neck at age 4, he said, his mother barely visited him during his two-month stay in the hospital.",
      "\u201cShe wasn\u2019t really touchy-feely,\u201d he said.",
      "When his mother got sick, Skakel said his father blamed him.",
      "\u201cIf you only did better in school, your mother wouldn\u2019t have to be in the hospital,\u201d Skakel recalled his father telling him. \u201cAnd I remember just going, \u2018Oh, my God, I wanted to die. I just wanted to die\u2019.\u201d",
      "Skakel said he was around 12 years old when his mother died. And like his father, he sought solace in drinking. He was sent away to a private school in Maine after he was caught driving under the influence at age 17. He said he was subjected to beatings from his classmates at Elan School. The school, which aimed to help troubled teens, closed down in 2011.",
      "\u201cThey literally picked me up over their head and carried me downstairs like I was a crash test dummy,\u201d Skakel said of one beating. \u201cAnd when I was probably 10 feet from the stage, they threw me. And I thought I broke my, my back on the stage.\u201d",
      "Skakel made it through reform school and rebuilt his life. He stopped drinking in 1982, got married in 1991 and later had a son. He earned a college degree in 1993 and competed on the international speed skiing circuit.",
      "Meanwhile, the long-stalled Moxley investigation was revived after another Skakel relative, William Kennedy Smith, was tried and acquitted in 1991 for an unrelated rape. Amid the tabloid frenzy of that case, an unfounded rumor emerged that he had been at the Skakel home on the night that Moxley died.",
      "The speculation around Smith went nowhere, but the media attention breathed new life into the stalled Moxley case. And that prompted Skakel\u2019s father to fund a private investigation aimed at clearing the family name.",
      "That move backfired. The end result was a report that was leaked to the media, casting doubt on the alibis of Thomas and Michael Skakel.",
      "Among the revelations was Michael Skakel\u2019s admission that on the night of the murder, he climbed a tree by Moxley\u2019s house and tossed pebbles at her window. When she didn\u2019t come out, he masturbated while sitting in the tree.",
      "Pressure to reinvestigate the Moxley killing ratcheted up further in 1993 when author Dominick Dunne published a novel called \u201cA Season in Purgatory\u201d based on the Moxley murder. That was followed five years later by \u201cMurder in Greenwich,\u201d which was written by disgraced O.J. Simpson detective Mark Fuhrman and which named Michael Skakel as Moxley\u2019s likely murderer.",
      "Two years later, on March 14, 2000, Skakel, 39, was arrested after investigators secured testimony from two former classmates at the Elan School who claimed he confessed to killing Moxley.",
      "Skakel was arraigned on a murder charge in juvenile court because he was 15 at the time of the crime. The case was later moved to regular court. He said his lawyer, Mickey Sherman, promised him that he\u2019d never see the inside of a courtroom.",
      "But two years later, Skakel was convicted of killing Moxley and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He was released in 2013 after his conviction was overturned.",
      "The judge ruled that Skakel had been denied a fair trial because, among other things, Sherman had failed to contact a witness who could have provided his client with an alibi. And in 2020, the state dropped the case against Skakel saying it would not be able to prove the case against him beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\u201cMickey Sherman basically proved to be the anti-Nostradamus,\u201d Goldman says in the podcast. \u201cEvery one of his predictions turned out to be dead wrong.\u201d"

      "\"So they crash into a mountain, and it becomes about them trying to survive, and slowly they wonder if they need to eat each other,\" he laughed. \"And they brought me in at some point and they wrote a new script, which was what became 'Anchorman.'\"",

      "\"But DreamWorks had just put us in turnaround, which means they weren\u2019t going to make it,\" he said of \"Anchorman.\"",

      "Thanks to that decision, \"Anchorman\" was put in production, and in 2004, it hit theaters.",
      "\u201c(Spielberg) was the reason Adam and Will were allowed to make 'Anchorman,\u2019\u201d Apatow said.",
      "Along with Ferrell, the movie featured then-rising comedians like Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate and Steve Carell.",
      "Apatow said Carell specifically always had the movie's staff in tears.",
      "\"If you were on the set of 'Anchorman,' and you were just watching the shoot, there was no one there who wasn\u2019t like, 'Steve Carell is the funniest guy ever,'\" he said.",
      "\"So just one day I\u2019m like, 'Do you have any ideas for yourself as a lead?' And then one day he told me about a sketch he worked on once about a guy who is at a poker game, and they were all talking dirty about sex, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s lying and hasn\u2019t had sex. And I thought, 'Sadly, I understand that,'\" Apatow laughed. \"I know how to develop that.\"",
      "That movie turned into Carell's breakout film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"",
      "When asked what advice he would give to people who are trying to get into comedy, Apatow turns to his new book, \"Comedy Nerd: A Lifelong Obsession in Stories and Pictures.\"",
      "\"Part of how I built the book is that I put all the failures in there also. So all the pilots that weren\u2019t picked up, everything that was a bomb. And I talk about how that happened. How did things fall apart? What\u2019s it like when they work? What\u2019s it like when they don\u2019t work?\" he said.",

      "\"Ironically, this week has been the busiest week since leaving the villa,\" Nic tells TODAY.com. \"I have a marathon to train for, so of course the week of is going to be the busiest.\"",
      "Nic, who will be running the marathon with Team Strava, says he decided to run the race just a few months ago, \"which I know is a bit later in the training process,\" he admits with a laugh. The registered nurse already has two marathons under his belt \u2014 one of which was part of an Ironman race.",
      "\"Hopefully it won't be too hard,\" he says of the NYC race.",

      "Just over a week before the marathon, Nic was in Miami for a launch party hosted by Celsius. There, he met up with Rob and Kendall from the show's breakout Season 6. Because they have shared \"lore,\" as Nic puts it, they didn't end up talking much about what happened during their time in \"Love Island\" villa.",

      "\"They don't go hand in hand,\" he says of his busy schedule and training. \"But after doing the events at night it's nice to wake up early in the morning and get the run done. It's definitely a way to clear the mind.\"",

      "After the race and into November, he says he and Olandria will have a \"lot more downtime.\"",
      "\"I think at this point we're looking for just a breath of a fresh air from all the hectic-ness,\" he says.",
      "\"I've said this before, like I want to go on our hot air balloon date, I want to do all these things \u2014\u00a0but at this point, I'm like, I just want to sit on a couch and do nothing with her,\" he adds. \"That sounds elite.\""

      "Chmerkovskiy then clarified that he doesn't let \"feelings and emotion\" cloud his \"commentary on dance.\"",
      "\u201cIt just comes with (a) completely different range of reasoning. And, you know, I'm that guy. And so I would like to explain myself, like I said. I would like this to be personal because this is crazy to me,\u201d he said.",
      "Chmerkovskiy's wife, brother Val Chmerkovskiy and sister-in-law Jenna Johnson have all appeared as professional dancers on \"DWTS.\" During his video message, the 45-year-old said many people reached out to him after his comments about Ravnik to criticize him for only winning the show once.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t really hurt my feelings by saying, \u2018Look at you, loser. You only won once.\u2019 Blah, blah, blah. Yes, I know that more than anybody else. I\u2019m also very well aware that every single member of my family has won 'Dancing with the Stars' more than I have. They are much better at 'Dancing with the Stars than me,'\u201d he said.",
      "Chmerkovskiy explained that he always had a hard time mastering one important element of the competition: public perception and what people think of him.",
      "\"Fundamentally, I don\u2019t care, and I lead with that. And because I lead with that, I\u2019m not fighting for anybody\u2019s votes,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd so in a platform where that\u2019s important, I\u2019m not the guy.\u201d",
      "Chmerkovskiy said he was motivated to apologize to Ravnik publicly after doing some soul searching, not because of the public's criticism.",
      "\u201c(When) I realize something about myself, I realize it. It\u2019s not going to be because somebody says that to me, it\u2019s because I finally understood that for myself,\u201d he said.",
      "At the end of his video, the professional dancer sent a message to social media users, saying, \"Let\u2019s not defend someone by attacking somebody else. That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say.\u201d",
      "After being eliminated from \"DWTS\" on Oct. 28, Ravnik addressed Chmerkovskiy's podcast comments during an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight.\"",
      "\"I have no comment on that. Look, I got all the love on this show. All the praise from the judges also, like everyone gave me so much love,\" he said. \"Whoever is saying, outside, the people who (are) trying to stay relevant and spreading the hate, this is not a way to do it. And I never will spread or take the hate.\""

      "\u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d icon Suzanne Rogers has announced that she was diagnosed with Stage 2 colorectal cancer and recently underwent treatment.",
      "Rogers, who has portrayed Salem staple Maggie Horton for 52 years, opened up about her cancer diagnosis during an interview with TV Insider published Oct. 30, revealing that her health struggles are the reason for her absence from the show.",
      "The 82-year-old actor told the entertainment outlet that she decided to make an appointment with her doctor after feeling that something \u201cwasn\u2019t quite right\u201d despite getting routine colonoscopies. She had another and the surgeon suggested that she return for an MRI, PET scan and biopsy after seeing her results.",
      "\u201cAnd the minute he said that I knew that it was something more,\u201d she recalled.",
      "She learned after another procedure that she had Stage 2 colorectal cancer. Her doctor informed her, \u201c\u2018You have cancer and you have to start treatment,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Rogers added, \u201cIt was all a shock. I mean, I think I was in a shock for several days because I take pretty good care of myself. But he said, \u2018It\u2019s a good thing you caught it in time.\u2019\u201d",
      "She underwent treatment this summer after \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d finished filming in June.",
      "\u201cIt was radiation every day and chemo every day for six weeks and it was tough,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt was tough knowing you had to do it five days a week and then you had off Saturday and Sunday. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekends because I didn\u2019t have to go to and see a doctor. I was so tired of seeing doctors.\u201d",
      "Although she initially didn\u2019t disclose her diagnosis, she later turned to co-star Linsey Godfrey, who plays her on-screen daughter Sarah Horton, for support. She revealed Godfrey held her hand during one of her infusions, and that other co-stars, like Paul Telfer, Mary Beth Evans, Stephen Nichols, Greg Rikaart and AnnaLynne McCord, were there for her, too. Producers also told her to prioritize her health and that she could resume portraying Rogers when she improved.",
      "Her treatment ended on July 31. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really good,\u201d she told TV Insider. \u201cI start back to work next week, so we\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cNow, I\u2019m feeling anxious like I do any time I get scripts because I want to do my very best and you don\u2019t want to hold up anybody. So that\u2019s the only anxiousness I feel. It\u2019s not because of my illness, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d",
      "Rogers said that her recent health struggles have changed her perspective on life. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I used to worry about some silly things,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd when you go through this, it kind of takes you a while to say, \u2018OK, well, this is what I have, and I will do my very best to fight it and to get through it.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I did. The prayers and the good wishes from my friends and my family helped me stay positive and stay on top of it and beat this.\u201d",
      "Her \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d family posted a message on Instagram about Rogers\u2019 diagnosis Oct 30 and told viewers they can expect to see Maggie on their televisions again soon.",
      "The show wrote, \u201cWe are delighted that Suzanne has come through this challenge with her trademark grace and strength. Fans will be glad to know that \u2018Maggie\u2019 will remain a constant presence in Salem.\u201d",
      "The post said Rogers\u2019 absence on the show in 2026 with me \u201cminimal.\u201d According to TV Insider, \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d films 10 months in advance.",
      "\u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d had previously commented on Rogers taking a hiatus from the show in July. The soap shared a statement with Soap Opera Digest at the time that addressed rumors Rogers was leaving, writing that the speculation, \u201ccould not be further from the truth, Maggie and Suzanne are integral to the show\u2019s history, present storylines, and now, on the heels of our pick-up, the future! Neither are going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Rogers has played Maggie on the beloved soap opera since 1973, totaling 3205 episodes according to IMDb. NBCUniversal confirmed that \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d has been renewed for seasons 62 and 63 on Peacock.",
      "Colorectal cancer develops in either the colon or the rectum, and about 3.9 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with the disease at some point in their life, the National Cancer Institute reports. Since 2018, the American Cancer Society has been recommending that patients start screening for colorectal cancer starting at the age of 45.",

      "Elena Rose has stepped into a new chapter of her singer-songwriter career with the release of her debut album, \u201cBendito Verano\" (\"Holy Summer\u201d).",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always had the dream to have, to write and to work on an album, almost to the point that it became a little bit of a nightmare because I had a lot of expectations,\u201d the 30-year-old Venezuelan singer-songwriter tells TODAY.com. \u201cI was pressuring myself a lot, and it wasn\u2019t the moment for it, but I would keep (telling) myself, \u2018It\u2019s going to come and be awesome.\u2019",
      "\u201cI just had no clue what it was going to be,\u201d she adds, having now accomplished her dream with \u201cBendito Verano.\u201d",
      "An acclaimed Grammy and multi-Latin Grammy nominee, Elena Rose \u2014 whose given name is Andrea Elena Mangiamarchi \u2014 has penned hit songs for artists like Bad Bunny, even receiving a Grammy nod for her work on \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\" which became the first Spanish-language album to be nominated for album of the year.",
      "Then there's songwriting credits on Becky G's \u201cMamiii\" featuring Karol G, Jennifer Lopez and Maluma's \"Pa' Ti,\" \u201cDe Vuelta Pa\u2019 La Vuelta\u201d by Daddy Yankee and Marc Anthony, as well as hits with Selena Gomez, Rauw Alejandro and Christina Aguilera, among others.",
      "When it came to her own album, Elena Rose was inspired by her love of summer, a \"heavenly\" playlist, an Italian getaway and most importantly, trusting her intuition.",
      "The result was a deeply personal 12-track, genre-blending album that Elena Rose says made her \u201cfeel proud\" \u2014 and \u201ctranscended music.\u201d",
      "The \u201cfirst name that came to mind\u201d for her creation was Holy Summer, which she translated to Spanish.",
      "\u201cSummer is my favorite time of the year,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of summer, I think of a sunset, I think of the beach, I think of the breeze, I think of happiness. I think of dancing and just having a lot of moments where you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this place is beautiful. Wow. I love the people I\u2019m with. Thank you, God, for my life. Thank you for the present.\u2019\u201d",
      "Collaborations with Eladio Carri\u00f3n, Beto Montenegro, Young Miko and Justin Quiles, as well as dreamy angelic music videos for each track, only enhanced her vision.",
      "Below, Elena Rose breaks down \u201cBendito Verano,\u201d the inspiration for her opening song \u201cMantra,\u201d her upcoming tour and more.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I think after (my 2024 song) \u201cMe Lo Merezco\u201d (\u201cI Deserve It\u201d) was born, I was like, \u201cThis is where I\u2019m feeling the best,\u201d because it transcended the music and it became more about the message and what it was doing in people\u2019s lives.",
      "It was that feeling of, \u201cLook at everything we\u2019ve gone through and we made it. We\u2019re here at the beach, let\u2019s just have fun and dance.\u201d Mixing that feeling of what summer means to me and then asking the question of, \u201cIf there were to be a summer in heaven, what playlist would they play?\u201d",
      "Which is why we have sax, we have trumpets because I would picture angels performing in heaven. (I wanted this album) to help us remember the things that really matter ... and it would be about love.",
      "We have elements like Afro that make me feel freedom, that make me feel at peace, joy and be in the present. There\u2019s a lot of roots feelings when I listen to a bass line, or when I listen to the drums that remind me that I come from amazing people that have done amazing things in order for me to be here.",
      "But then I have my message, which is where I really come in and put like my little grain of salt. I speak about mental health and awareness and emotional responsibility and real and unconditional love.",
      "We went to Italy to record all the visuals. Every song has a visual. The first time I went to Italy, it was right after I picked up my relationship with my father. We hadn\u2019t spoken in like five years and my father is half Chilean, half Italian, but grew up in Venezuela.",
      "My last name is Italian, and I had always wanted to go to Italy, and I\u2019m grateful it happened right after we hugged it out. Visually, the woman that I saw in Italy was a woman hugging everything about where she comes from and who she is. (Someone) who never lost her essence, but really worked on the woman that she wants to be and who she wants to be for the world and her industry and her craft. I\u2019m grateful to see that visually. I needed to see it. And in a place like Italy, in Lake Como, the first thing that I thought was, \"If God wakes up in the morning and opens the window of his bedroom, this is the view.\"",
      "And then we recorded everything in Italy, aesthetically with this woman that you see vulnerability and innocence, but then you also see her strength and her resilience.",
      "The album opens up with a mantra that I wrote with my life coach that repeats, \"I am, I am.\" It\u2019s just one minute. I want people to start the days like that. It's how I start my days.",
      "The interlude was my best friend. I asked him, \u201cIf you could describe the warrior of light, how would you describe her?\u201d",
      "And then it closes with a song that I wrote to my inner child. It begins with my mom and my grandmother singing. So it\u2019s very, very intentional, just a big ball of love.",
      "I think every song has something like \u201cLuna de Miel\u201d (with Rawayana), to me, is the wedding song of the album. \u201cLa de Dios\u201d is the moment to connect with the purest part of your heart, your inner child, and also to connect with God. It\u2019s a reminder in a world that right now is in a lot of chaos.",
      "\u201cAleluya!\u201d tells you, love without fear. \u201cAlma\u201d tells you, look at everything that you\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve always had everything and if you lose whatever you have, you\u2019re losing nothing.",
      "\u201cAm\u00e9n Beb\u00e9,\u201d you have a partner and you build something together, a best friend, a boyfriend, a dog, celebrate life. There\u2019s a little bit of everything. I\u2019m just grateful that I have an album that I think you can listen from beginning to end, and it\u2019s gonna be an experience.",
      "I\u2019m excited, happy. This is my first US tour. We\u2019re going to be presenting the album. We\u2019re preparing a very intimate show, which is how I like it. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s gonna be way too long and people are gonna tell me, \u201cYou guys have to leave.\u201d And we\u2019re all gonna be like, \u201cNo!\u201d",
      "I\u2019m excited to see my warriors of light. They\u2019re everything to me. We feed each other and we exchange energy. We elevate each other, and I\u2019m bringing now a work that I put all my heart and soul (into), and I can\u2019t wait for you guys to listen to it."

      "Caitlyn Jenner has returned.",
      "In Season 7, Episode 2, of  \"The Kardashians,\" Caitlyn Jenner surprised her family members when she showed up to say goodbye to their former family home.",
      "\"About an hour ago, I called Caitlyn and I said, 'What are you doing?'\" Kris Jenner told producers.",
      "\"And of course, she said, 'I'm eating dinner watching Fox News.' I said, 'Of course you are.' And I said, 'Would you like to come say goodbye to El Dorado Meadow with us and be with your kids, and she said, 'I'm on my way.'\"",
      "In the previous episode of \"The Kardashians,\" Kris Jenner revealed she sold her family's home for monetary purposes. In an attempt to say goodbye to the mansion, she invited all of her kids over, including Rob Kardashian, who is rarely seen on the show, to have one final dinner at the house.",
      "While gathering around the table, Kris Jenner introduced her ex-spouse by saying they were missing someone who should be with them. Soon enough, Caitlyn Jenner walked through the door, eliciting gasps and smiles from everyone in the room.",
      "\"I was not expecting this tonight,\" Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said, seemingly shocked. \"I'm just waiting for another ex-husband to walk through the door.\"",
      "Kendall and Kylie Jenner also said they didn't expect Caitlyn to show up for the gathering.",
      "\"I definitely was not expecting my dad to be here,\" Kendall Jenner said. \"Just knowing the relationship my mom has with my dad, not that it's bad, it's just distant. I think my mom had a hard time inviting my dad to some of our family gatherings in the past, so it makes me happy that Kylie and I didn't have to ask for my dad to be invited and my mom just thought it was a good idea regardless.\"",
      "\"I don't know if my parents will ever be best friends again, but this is definitely a great first step,\" Kylie Jenner added.",
      "Once Kris Jenner and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian had a moment to themselves, Kim Kardashian thanked her mom for inviting Caitlyn Jenner over.",
      "The pair were married from 1991 to 2015. In 2015, Caitlyn Jenner revealed she was transitioning to a woman in an interview she did with Vanity Fair. As depicted in the family's reality show, Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner's relationship has been strained ever since.",
      "\"That was really big of you and I'm shocked you did that, but that was very nice,\" Kim Kardashian said while praising her mom.",
      "\"This felt like the right thing to do,\" Kris Jenner responded. \"And it felt like the right thing to do for her and for Kendall and Kylie.\"",
      "Later during the episode, Kendall Jenner spoke about her relationship with Caitlyn Jenner and said it's a work in progress.",
      "\"I have to compartmentalize my relationship with my dad in a way because I love her, she's my dad, like, we have a good relationship, but sometimes I get frustrated with her with certain things because we have completely different views on things,\" she said.",
      "\"But, other than that, I always want to include her. I know that she doesn't have a lot outside of her family and I think that she gets lonely.\"",
      "As for Kim Kardashian, she said she still keeps in contact with the former patriarch of the Kardashian clan.",
      "\"I do see Caitlyn. I talk to her all the time. For her 75th birthday, I wrote her a card that said, 'Because of you and everything that you have taught me, I feel so blessed,\" she said.",
      "\"I think it helped shaped who I am and why I'm so successful today and I'm grateful for that,\" the Skims founder added."

      "Envisioned as a temporary boundary under the first phase of the agreement, which was brokered in part by President Donald Trump, the line has instead become a flashpoint.",
      "Israel carried out days of strikes on Gaza last week despite the truce, killing more than 100 people, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, Israel said it was responding to what it said was a Hamas attack that killed one of its soldiers operating within the \"yellow line.\"",
      "Hamas denied involvement. Israeli forces had earlier separately opened fire on Palestinians in incidents in which it said people neared or crossed the boundary line prior to physical barriers being put in place.",
      "The next stages of Trump's plan that would see Israel withdraw further are still to be negotiated.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Monday that he met with senior White House officials to discuss efforts to further implement Trump's 20-point plan. Analysts warned that with the future of the truce appearing to be on \u201cshaky\u201d ground, it could be some time before there is clarity.",
      "NBC News spoke to some Palestinians whose homes, or what's left of them, lie just beyond the barrier. For them, the line has become a physical manifestation of their fears that they may never be able to return to their land.",
      "'I can't even look at it'",
      "The Israel Defense Forces began laying the yellow markers last month in what the military said was an effort to clearly delineate the areas it had agreed to withdraw to under the ceasefire deal with Hamas, which came into effect Oct. 10.",
      "It came after repeated incidents of Israeli forces firing upon Palestinians who they said had approached or crossed the withdrawal boundary, dubbed the \u201cyellow line.\"",
      "In one case last month, the Gaza Civil Defense agency said Israeli forces had killed nine people in a bus. The Israeli military said troops initially fired warning shots at the vehicle, which it said had crossed the boundary, and then \"opened fire to remove the threat\" when the vehicle didn't stop."

      "Koza-Culp\u2019s discovery was made possible by the Names Database at Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. And now, the very database that helped Koza-Culp find her family has reached an important milestone: Yad Vashem has recovered the names of 5 million of the estimated 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators.",
      "\u201cEach person has not only [a] name, but also a fate and a face,\u201d Sima Velkovic, the leader of Yad Vashem\u2019s family roots research team, told NBC News. \u201cWe want to know: Who were these people?\u201d",
      "Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered approximately 6 million Jews across Europe \u2014 about two-thirds of the continent\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation and extermination camps such as Auschwitz. Millions of others, including disabled people and political dissidents, were also killed under Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime.",
      "Yad Vashem\u2019s organized effort to restore Jewish victims\u2019 names began in the 1950s and has stretched across generations, powered by survivors, their descendents and researchers determined to ensure every victim is honored.",
      "How they did it",
      "Reaching this milestone was not easy.",
      "\u201cThere never was a list of Holocaust victims,\u201d said Alexander Avram, director of the Hall of Names and the Central Database of Shoah Victims\u2019 Names at Yad Vashem.",
      "\u201cThe Nazis and their collaborators did not issue death certificates. \u2026 In most cases the Jews were just killed or gassed or \u2026 no registration whatsoever,\u201d Avram told NBC News in an interview inside the Hall of Names memorial.",
      "Men, women and even children were shot into unmarked mass graves. At extermination camps, the Nazis burned the remains of Jewish victims in crematoria to hide evidence of genocide.",
      "To reconstruct victims\u2019 identities, Yad Vashem\u2019s researchers have scoured tens of thousands of sources, including archival material.",
      "One of the key sources has been \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d \u2014 biographical fact sheets submitted by survivors and those who knew the victims to preserve their memory.",
      "Each page is vetted carefully, Avram said. Researchers cross-reference submissions with prewar lists and historical events, sometimes requesting additional documentation before accepting a record.",
      "The pages \u201ccan be considered tombstones for the Jews who were assassinated during the Holocaust,\u201d Avram said.",
      "For families like Koza-Culp\u2019s, those pages are far more than data points. \u201cTo now be able to look at that photo and know their names \u2026 and to know a little bit about them, to me, makes them feel real and makes them feel like they mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes them feel like they matter.\u201d",
      "Those names have also reunited branches of a family tree that had been separated for decades.",
      "\u201cThe fabric of our family was ripped apart, and through this \u2026 we\u2019ve stitched it back together a little bit, but \u2026 those scars are kind of always there,\u201d she said.",
      "The race against time",
      "That sentiment drives Yad Vashem\u2019s mission today, as historians race to preserve survivors\u2019 memories while these eyewitnesses to genocide are still alive. Experts estimate that 90% of Holocaust survivors will have died by 2040.",
      "New tools may help. Yad Vashem says artificial intelligence could help researchers scour archival material, possibly helping uncover around 250,000 more names.",
      "But AI cannot track down names that are not in the historical record. Yad Vashem is imploring survivors and their descendants to share their stories now so that the very people Hitler hoped to erase are instead remembered for generations to come.",
      "\u201cThis is the last hour,\u201d warned Avram.",
      "Jesse Kirsch reported from New York City, and Paul Goldman reported from Jerusalem."

      "GIZA, Egypt \u2014 They\u2019re the crown jewels of the Grand Egyptian Museum \u2014 two galleries devoted to the ancient pharaoh Tutankhamun.",
      "Showcasing more than 5,300 objects from the young king\u2019s tomb, including his iconic death mask and glittering royal regalia, the new section of the vast museum here on the outskirts of Cairo is expected to draw millions of visitors every year.",
      "The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, were officially opened in an elaborate and long-awaited grand opening ceremony on Saturday in front of delegates from more than 70 countries.",
      "On a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "At Saturday's grand opening, attended by a number of European and Arab leaders, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sought to give the event an international scale, calling on attendees to \"make this museum a platform for dialogue, a destination for knowledge, a forum for humanity, and a beacon for all who love life and believe in the value of humankind.\"",
      "With the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx as their backdrop, actors dressed in ancient Egyptian garb paid tribute to thousands of years of history, as an orchestra played fanfares. Hundreds of drones created a light show in the sky, depicting figures including Tutankhamun and ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Hassan Allam, CEO of the museum's management company, said daily visitor numbers would surge from 6,000 to 15,000 this week as the doors are opened on the \"out of this world\" Tutankhamun Gallery.",
      "He said running the museum had been a \"challenging and yet wonderful experience,\" describing it as a \"great privilege\" to \"play a small role in Egypt's history, maintaining it, managing it, and hosting Egyptology lovers from across the world.\"",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony marks the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",

      "Inside each ampule is the substance at the heart of the geopolitical strife between the United States and China: fentanyl, the deadly opioid at the center of a deal outlined by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday.",
      "NBC News got exclusive access to the headquarters of Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical, the largest producer of the drug in China, and indeed Asia, at its sprawling complex in the central city of Yichang.",
      "Humanwell says that it only supplies fentanyl for use in hospitals and that it does not export any medication to the United States, Mexico or Canada. In 51 years of operating, \u201cwe have never had a single incident of a drug going missing \u2014 not a single dose has ever been lost,\u201d its president, Du Wentao, said in an interview inside his factory, which is surrounded by high fences wrapped in concertina wire and electric sensors.",
      "Humanwell is one of only five companies in China licensed to produce fentanyl for use in hospitals, and it makes around 100 million doses of fentanyl variants each year.",
      "After a strict registration process to get past the main gate, all visitors and staff alike \u2014 including the CEO \u2014 are required to wear blue hospital caps, shoe covers and lab coats to ensure they do not contaminate the workspace.",
      "Most of the production line is automated to limit human contact, with the vials being washed and sterilized and then filled with fentanyl using long rubber tubes.",
      "Two staffers in protective gear supervised the process, with an alarm pinging every 10 minutes to remind them to spray their gloved hands with disinfectant. The vials are then inspected using flashes of light, stamped, boxed up and shipped out via a warehouse.",
      "Trump pressed Xi for a crackdown on fentanyl at a meeting in South Korea on Thursday, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour. The president said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "China has previously defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials rejected that narrative. \u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",
      "Du, the president of Humanwell Healthcare, which produces 100 million doses annually of fentanyl-based products, says that the meticulously clean, automated and controlled operation observed by NBC News was no facade.",
      "\u201cThe management of fentanyl drugs in China is among the strictest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no possibility that any dose from our company has flowed to the United States. I can state this with full confidence and certainty \u2014 there is no issue whatsoever.\u201d",
      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. As Washington and Beijing seek common ground on the issue, experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done.",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank, speaking ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "The problem, he said, is that there is no \u201cset number\u201d of precursors to fentanyl.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a clear list of specific items that you would be able to easily interdict,\u201d Swaine said. \u201cAnd a lot of them, of course, are very dual-use items.\u201d",
      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue after the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

      "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in both Jamaica and Cuba in the last two days, followed what has unfortunately become a familiar pattern for major storms in a warming world.",
      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",

      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",

      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",

      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",

      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business.

      "Democrats investigating Jeffrey Epstein have intensified their calls for Britain\u2019s former Prince Andrew to answer questions about his links to the disgraced financier, days after King Charles stripped his younger brother of his title.",
      "The calls for testimony from Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, as he is now known, came as new emails emerged showing he suggested a \u201ccatch-up\u201d with Epstein just months after the notorious pedophile was released from prison.",
      "Several Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee told the BBC that Andrew should voluntarily testify before Congress. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., said Saturday that if the former prince \u201cwants to do right by the victims, he will come forward,\u201d noting that his name had been mentioned \u201cmany times\u201d in survivors\u2019 accounts.",
      "Fellow committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., urged Andrew to \u201ccome and testify and tell us what you know\u201d during a Friday interview, while Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., said Andrew\u2019s testimony might be \u201chelpful in getting justice\u201d for survivors.",
      "Committee member Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., echoed the calls in an interview with The Guardian newspaper, saying Andrew \u201cshould be called to testify.\u201d No Republicans on the committee have publicly called for Andrew to testify, and no formal subpoena has been issued.",
      "New emails between Andrew and Epstein released on Friday in unsealed court documents have added to the scrutiny.",
      "In April 2010, less than a year after Epstein\u2019s release from prison for soliciting minors, Andrew wrote that it would be \u201cgood to catch up in person.\u201d Epstein had proposed that Andrew meet American banker Jes Staley in London, but Andrew replied that he would be out of the country and might \u201cdrop by\u201d New York later in the year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll look and see if I can make a couple of days before the summer,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Andrew and Epstein were pictured together in New York\u2019s Central Park in December 2010, a meeting Andrew had previously said was to end their friendship.",
      "That account was challenged last month when the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday newspapers published another email reported to have been sent by Andrew to Epstein in 2011, not verified by NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe are in this together,\u201d the newspapers reported that the email read. \u201cPlay some more soon.\u201d",
      "Andrew, who just two weeks ago announced he would relinquish the use of his Duke of York title, was on Thursday formally stripped of it as well as his status as a prince, and effectively evicted from the 30-room mansion where he has lived for more than 20 years.",
      "Pressure mounted following the posthumous publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which details her allegations that Andrew had sex with her on multiple occasions.",
      "Andrew reached a legal settlement with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount in February 2022 after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old. He has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",

      "But what\u2019s known as the International Stabilization Force (ISF) is far from a reality, and so far it lacks a detailed mission, confirmed participants and sources of funding.

      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto did say in a speech at the United Nations in September that his country was ready to deploy troops to Gaza.",
      "According to Rubio, one complication is that many of the countries that have said they are willing to send troops, money or both would require a United Nations resolution or an international agreement to authorize their involvement. Israel has long been deeply critical of the role the U.N. plays in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, accusing it of bias and of perpetuating the conflict by maintaining Palestinians in a permanent refugee status.",
      "Hamas, which hasn\u2019t commented on the ISF plans, is also a wild card.",

      "Natan Sachs, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cIf a security force was charged with disarming [Hamas] and dislodging them as the Trump plan detailed, there is no question to my mind that they would resist that and resist that with force.\u201d",

      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor: No longer a prince, but is he no longer a threat to the British monarchy?",
      "King Charles III's move to banish his brother was largely welcomed Friday by the British media, politicians and royal observers as a necessary, if overdue, intervention.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth attempt by Buckingham Palace to shield itself from the scandal over Andrew's ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the king will be hoping it is the last.",
      "Andrew, who just two weeks ago announced he would relinquish the use of his Duke of York title, has now been formally stripped of it and all his other royal titles, and effectively evicted from the 30-room mansion where he has lived for more than 20 years. It marks a dramatic culmination of a saga that has proved so damaging for the institution as it navigates waning popularity, family feuds and health crises.",
      "\"The king realized that it wasn't enough for him to just say that he would no longer use his title Duke of York, but more action had to be taken,\" NBC News royal contributor Emily Nash said. \"He understood that this was really getting to a point where it was doing very serious damage to the royal family.\"",
      "Nash pointed to just how rare a step Charles has taken \u2014 the last prince to be stripped of his title was punished for fighting for  Germany in World War 1.",
      "Andrew first stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after his disastrous BBC interview in which he cited an inability to sweat that he said contradicted allegations against him, and in 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his royal and military patronages.",
      "The move two weeks ago appeared designed to head off fallout from a renewed wave of revelations. But instead they appeared to open the floodgates.",
      "The token rent of \"one peppercorn\u201d that Andrew has reportedly paid on his sprawling Royal Lodge home since funding its renovation two decades ago drew outrage not just from the press, but also in Parliament, as the scandal threatened to break long-standing norms that helped shield the monarchy from public scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Charles was heckled by a protester who shouted about whether he had \u201casked the police to cover up\u201d for his brother, and how long he had known about Andrew and Epstein.",
      "Then came the statement from Buckingham Palace. \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" it read.",
      "The measures taken by the king received approving coverage Friday in much of the tabloid media, and were welcomed \"warmly\" by a government minister, as well as the leaders of the opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy can see that the PR war has been lost until now, and to win it, they need to show distaste for what Andrew has done and show solidarity with the victims,\u201d said royal historian Andrew Lownie, author of a recent biography of Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.",
      "Lownie said he believed there may even be grounds for a criminal investigation.",
      "The publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which added new detail to her allegations that Andrew had sex with her on at least three occasions, had intensified the pressure on the royals.",
      "Giuffre, with whom Andrew settled a suit in 2022 for an undisclosed amount after she accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old, committed suicide in April. Andrew has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "In his statement two weeks ago, Andrew cited \u201cthe continued accusations about me\u201d as a distraction. \u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles' expression of solidarity with Epstein's victims, \"stood in total contrast,\" to this, said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\"That difference speaks volumes,\" he said. \"This is the most drastic move the king could have made.\"",
      "Charles\u2019 order comes with immediate effect and Andrew will be forced to leave Royal Lodge as soon as is practicable. He will move to a property on the royal family\u2019s private estate 140 miles away in Sandringham, though it is understood that Ferguson will not be joining him.",
      "Buckingham Palace said the king\u2019s decision was made with the support of the wider family, including his son and heir, Prince William \u2014 who is widely viewed as supporting a firmer stance on Andrew as he looks ahead to his own reign.",
      "But not everyone is satisfied by Andrew being cast out from the royal family.",
      "\"Being told that you have to live in your own house and being called by your name is not a punishment,\" said Graham Smith, the chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group, Republic.",
      "Smith called for a proper investigation into Andrew's ties with Epstein and the role the rest of the family may have played in the scandal.",
      "He added that Republic was pursuing a private prosecution, which could culminate in the public prosecutor taking over the case if there's deemed to be enough merit.",
      "Lownie said Charles may have decided to kick Andrew out now because, \u201cthey\u2019re worried new revelations might come out about his relationship with Epstein.\u201d",
      "But, he added, \u201cThe king has done what he can.\u201d"

      "Britain's Prince Andrew will have his royal titles formally removed and will move out of his home in Windsor, Buckingham Palace said Thursday, as the royal faces growing pressure over his ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Buckingham Palace said in a statement that King Charles had \"initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours\" of his younger brother.",
      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the palace said, an escalation from measures announced two weeks ago, when it said that Andrew would stop using some of his titles, including the Duke of York.",
      "The palace said that the \"censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" adding: \"Their Majesties [King Charles and Queen Camilla] wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"",
      "The palace also said that a formal notice had been served for Andrew to leave his home at the Royal Lodge, close to Windsor Castle.",
      "It comes after revelations that Andrew was paying a rent of \"one peppercorn (if demanded) per annum\" on the 30-room mansion owned by the Crown Estate, despite having stepped back from public duties six years ago. The arrangement was revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request by The Times newspaper last week.",
      "The palace said: \"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew will move to a property on the royal family's private Sandringham estate, and his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will retain their titles, according to the palace.",
      "The Royal Lodge was the home of Elizabeth, King George VI's consort and the mother of Queen Elizabeth II, from 1952 until she died in 2002.",
      "Legal documents published by The Times, not verified by NBC News, indicated that Andrew paid 1 million pounds for the lease when he moved into the property in 2004, also paying 7.5 million pounds for refurbishment works. The palace and Andrew did not previously comment on the reports.",
      "In a statement two weeks ago announcing he would give up his Duke of York title, Andrew cited \u201cthe continued accusations about me\u201d that \u201cdistract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d Andrew said.",
      "The storm has only intensified since, with the publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, detailing allegations against Andrew, last Monday.",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "Andrew reached a legal settlement with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount in February 2022 after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old. He has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "\"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,\" Giuffre's family said in a statement Thursday after the statement from Buckingham Palace was released. \"Virginia Roberts Giuffre, our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory.\""

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea \u2014 There were declarations of a new \u201cgolden age\u201d of alliances, photo stops in a gift store stocked with Trump memorabilia and even a golden crown.",
      "On his three-country tour of Asia, President Donald Trump received a warm welcome from foreign leaders and showcased a diplomatic style rooted in personal rapport and dealmaking, culminating in the trade truce he reached Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Trump appeared to relish his reception from leaders of Asian allies and partners who sought every possible opportunity to flatter and delight him even as their countries are reeling from the impact of his tariffs and other policies.",
      "Putting his arms literally and figuratively around Japan\u2019s newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Trump in Tokyo promised a \u201cnew golden age\u201d of U.S.-Japan relations and accepted a gift of cherry blossom trees and a putter that belonged to his friend, the late former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Takaichi was the second Asian leader on this trip to say she would nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize he so highly covets, after Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, whose ceasefire agreement with Thailand was brokered in part by Trump.",
      "In Gyeongju, Trump received a large golden crown, a replica of the crown of the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla, from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. Trump and Lee were pictured in a gift shop at the Gyeongju National Museum, where items on display included a red \u201cUSA\u201d hat, Trump-branded sneakers and a shirt bearing the president\u2019s mug shot.",
      "A fighter jet escort and traditional dancers greeted Trump as he arrived Sunday in Malaysia, the first stop on his trip. After joining Trump in his motorcade, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim cracked a joke about a shared commonality, a reminder of some of the challenges faced by the American president before his election last November.",
      "\u201cI was in prison, but you almost got there,\u201d Ibrahim quipped.",
      "Even Xi, before sitting down with Trump in South Korea for their first meeting since Trump returned to office, told the president that China\u2019s development \u201cgoes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again.\u201d",
      "Trump said the meeting with Xi, which lasted about an hour and 40 minutes, was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of zero to 10.",
      "The warm embrace of Trump during the trip marked a contrast to the months of tense negotiations that preceded it. The administration had pushed ahead with a series of punishing tariffs as part of a broader effort to reset trade relationships.",
      "Rates for key U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, now at 15%, are below those imposed on other countries but still high by historical standards, and have greatly strained ties.",
      "\u201cThe agreement that was signed between the Japanese government and the American government on tariffs is so unbelievably one-sided,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus. \u201cAnd the American side has sort of been trumpeting that fact.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, a South Korean mayor flew to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s tariffs outside the White House, saying 50% levies on steel in particular were pushing his steelmaking hub of Pohang to the brink of collapse.",
      "Pohang is only about 30 minutes from Gyeongju, where Trump met with South Korean officials Wednesday to finalize a trade deal with the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. Trump said that a trade deal had been \u201cpretty much finalized,\u201d the details of which were later confirmed by a senior South Korean official.",
      "The U.S.-South Korea trade deal comes less than two months after more than 300 South Korean workers were escorted in chains from a Hyundai plant in Georgia during a raid by U.S. immigration officials, a shocking sight that humiliated Koreans.",
      "The image aired continuously on news programs in South Korea, which only weeks earlier had pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment. The workers later returned home without charges to cheers and protests, and a conciliatory message from Trump, who said he wanted foreign companies \u201cto bring their people of expertise\u201d into the country and didn\u2019t want to \u201cfrighten off\u201d investment.",
      "Leaders this week signaled that they were ready to move past the friction. Takaichi signed framework agreements with the U.S. to secure a supply of rare earths and on nuclear power reactors, and even told Trump that she is considering a purchase of Ford F-150s for government work even though they are widely considered too big for Japanese streets. Trump responded by offering her \u201canything you want.\u201d",
      "Addressing business executives in Gyeongju, Trump reflected on the differences between corporate dealmaking and heads-of-state diplomacy. He said he never believed in the idea of a win-win deal, but has since learned to search for balance.",
      "\u201cIt really is a little bit different than you\u2019re doing a business deal, and you want to just rip their hearts out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut when you have nations, it\u2019s a little bit different. You\u2019ve got to all balance out a little bit.\u201d",
      "The president, who has long touted his negotiating acumen from the business world, spent the week emphasizing stronger partnerships and better balance in U.S. trade relationships.",
      "He said after meeting with Xi that he was lowering fentanyl-related tariffs to 10% from 20% in exchange for greater efforts by China to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid. The two leaders also reached an agreement to delay Chinese export curbs on strategically crucial rare earth materials.",
      "Trump \u201cseems to have an affinity for President Xi, and I think that he seems to think of Xi not as an avatar of imperial ambition, but rather as the head of an impressive rival business company,\u201d said Ali Wyne, an adviser on U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.",
      "Trump mused over how fast it had all come together.",
      "\u201cCan you believe it? One year ago, I was campaigning to win. Can you imagine that?\u201d Trump said in South Korea this week. \u201cHere I am president. We\u2019ve done so many different things, economically, militarily, peace-wise. You know \u2014 peace through strength.\u201d"

      "\u201cA lot of finalization,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One after he departed Busan, South Korea, where he met Thursday with Xi for about an hour and 40 minutes, saying he would rate the \u201camazing\u201d meeting a \u201c12\u201d on a scale from zero to 10.",
      "While they did not ink a finalized agreement, Trump said that a deal could be signed \u201cpretty soon\u201d and that there were \u201cnot too many major stumbling blocks.\u201d",
      "Trump said that he would visit China in April and that Xi would visit either Florida or Washington \u201csome time after that.\u201d",
      "Here are the main takeaways from the summit:",
      "Fentanyl",
      "Trump said he was lowering fentanyl tariffs on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately. He said that would bring the total effective tariff rate on Chinese imports to 47% from 57%.",
      "Trump said he trusts Xi will \u201cwork very hard\u201d to stop the illicit flow of fentanyl precursors, the chemicals used to make the deadly opioid, from China to other countries. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a big difference,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. officials say China has not done enough to stop the illegal export of the precursor ingredients, which are processed into fentanyl in Mexican labs and then smuggled into the United States.",
      "China has rejected the accusations, calling its anti-fentanyl efforts the \u201cmost relentless\u201d in the world.",
      "Rare earth materials",
      "A key issue in U.S.-China trade negotiations has been rare earth materials, which are crucial for making magnets that go in everything from turbines to electric vehicles.",
      "China, which has a near-monopoly on the global supply, rattled automakers around the world when it imposed strict export controls on the materials, saying it was trying to snuff out their military use, and it has since used them as a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks.",
      "Trump said Xi had agreed to a one-year reprieve on the curbs that is likely to be \u201croutinely extended.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of the rare earth has been settled, and that\u2019s for the world,\u201d he said. A White House official standing alongside him said Trump and Xi had come to \u201can understanding\u201d and that China is \u201cnot going to impose the rare earth controls that they proposed.\u201d",
      "Analysts say even though the United States is pushing to reduce its reliance on China for the materials \u2014 with Trump signing critical minerals agreements with Thailand, Malaysia and Japan on this trip \u2014 it will be a while before that happens.",
      "\u201cBuilding new mines and, especially, expanding processing capacity \u2014 which is the real bottleneck \u2014 requires years of sustained effort and substantial investment,\u201d Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told NBC News.",
      "Soybeans",
      "Trump said China, which resumed purchases of U.S. soybeans ahead of the meeting after having boycotted them for months, would purchase \u201clarge, tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said China would buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between now and January as part of an agreement to purchase 25 million metric tons annually for three years.",
      "The halt in purchases from China, the biggest market for U.S. soybeans, has been a major pain point for American farmers, who have been pressing the Trump administration to resolve the issue.",
      "China had not purchased any U.S. soybeans since May, sourcing instead from South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil.",
      "\"Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns, that\u2019s off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,\u201d Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d",
      "Ukraine",
      "Trump has long vowed to broker an end to the war in Ukraine, but after having faced resistance from Russia, he has turned to the Kremlin\u2019s close partners for help: India and China.",
      "The United States and China will \u201cwork together\u201d on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said, adding, \u201cUkraine came up very strongly; we talked about it for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both going to work together to see if we can get something done,\u201d he said.",
      "Taiwan and Nvidia",
      "Asked about Taiwan, Trump told reporters that he and Xi didn\u2019t talk about the Beijing-claimed island democracy during their meeting. \u201cTaiwan never came up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not discussed, actually.\u201d",
      "When it came to the American artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be worth $5 trillion, Trump said there was no discussion as to whether the United States would further relax its export curbs to allow the export of Nvidia\u2019s latest chips, called Blackwell.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Blackwell chips,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The United States allows limited exports of the older H20 GPU chips, which are a modified version specially designed for the Chinese market.",
      "TikTok",
      "Trump did not address the proposed TikTok deal between the United States and China after the meeting, but it appears China approved it during Trump\u2019s Asia trip.",
      "Under a U.S. law that was passed last year based on national security concerns, the popular Chinese-owned app must sell its U.S. operations to a U.S. owner.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal might be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. After the meeting, Bessent told Fox Business Network that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation."
