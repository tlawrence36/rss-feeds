      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "The Times said it stood by its reporting and planned to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Baldoni says that at another point during the production, because he has back problems, he privately and politely asked Lively her weight so that he could work with his personal trainer to be able to safely lift her in the film.",
      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Baldoni says the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d moves from Lively that led to her attempt at a counter-narrative included naming a drink at the post-premiere party \u201cRyle You Wait,\u201d after the character who engages in domestic violence.",
      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",
      "Prior to \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart,\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",
      "\u201cLively knew full well that making those allegations would be a career death sentence for Plaintiffs, especially given that Baldoni has lived his private and public life as an impassioned advocate for gender equality and healthy masculinity,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit says Lively's cruelty even extended to having her suit served on Baldoni and his co-defendants during the onset of the wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area, saying that on a day when they were \"gathering their kids and pets, preparing 'go bags' and monitoring evacuation orders while fearing for their homes, Lively\u2014from the safety of her penthouse in New York\u2014 deployed process servers.\u201d",
      "The suit against Baldoni and other defendants was filed on Dec. 31, but the serving of papers as required by law came the following week."

      "Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich",
      "NEW YORK -- Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.",
      "All around the room is a buzzing clutter of period analog equipment. The video monitors act like windows, offering perspectives of the drama just outside: the taking of Israeli Olympic team members by the Palestinian militant group Black September.",
      "Inside the control room are the sports producers who were thrown into covering one of the first breaking news events televised worldwide. Some 900 million viewers are estimated to have watched.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a taut procedural recently nominated for best film, drama, by the Golden Globes, suggests this was a seminal moment in media history. Inside the control room, a handful of producers reckon in real time with questions that still pervade today\u2019s journalism: What\u2019s appropriate to show? Are we informing or sensationalizing? Do we have our facts straight?",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show this moment where media forever changed,\u201d says John Magaro, who stars as producer Geoffrey Mason. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t know what they were unlocking, what they were letting out of a Pandora\u2019s Box. They were just trying to tell the story. But in doing that, they opened up a road to more sensationalism in journalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, has been hailed as an expertly crafted pressure cooker of journalism ethics. While the Munich Olympics terrorist attack has been the subject of several previous films, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cMunich\u201d (2005) and the 1999 documentary \u201cOne Day in September,\u201d \u201cSeptember 5\u201d \u2013 a kind of combination of \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d \u2013 keeps its focus entirely on the broadcast that culminated in Jim McKay\u2019s much-remembered announcement of the hostages' tragic end: \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group of experienced or trained news journalists reporting on this crisis,\u201d says Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum, who wrote the screenplay with Moritz Binder. \u201cIt was a bunch of sports TV people. That offered an interesting opportunity to confront them with these questions, in an almost innocent way.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d what was on TV screens in 1972, like McKay\u2019s report, is likewise what's seen in the movie. Real archival footage is a co-star. But everyone inside the studio is played by a sterling ensemble, including Peter Sarsgaard (a veteran of another striking journalism movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cShattered Glass\u201d ) as \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d creator Roone Arledge and Ben Chaplin as producer Marvin Bader.",
      "But if there\u2019s a central figure in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d it\u2019s Mason, a then-young ABC Sports producer thrown into covering one of the biggest news stories of the decade. It was likewise a leading-man chance for Magaro, the talented 41-year-old Ohio native whose sensitive performances in films like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d and \u201cPast Lives\u201d have made him a standout character actor.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what was the most intriguing part of the script for me,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be an actor without feeling this competitive nature and need to seize opportunities when they\u2019re presented because there\u2019s not a lot them. I think it was the same for Geoff Mason at the time.\u201d",
      "Magaro\u2019s first time on a movie set was as an extra in \u201cMunich.\u201d Since then, though, he\u2019s grown as an actor through an ethic of hard work that he traces back to his family\u2019s immigrant, working-class roots.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m a 5-7 nebbishy white kid from Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cThis kind of journey doesn\u2019t happen to many of us. It\u2019s been a hard road at times and it\u2019s been a continuous climb. I never expected to get this far but I always had a drive in me to get better as an actor.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d Fehlbaum put a premium on authenticity. From museums and collectors he gathered the then-cutting edge video technology of the early 1970s and brought it up to working order. Walking onto the set, which with near-accuracy recreated the ABC control room, was \u201clike stepping onto a submarine everyday,\u201d says Magaro. (The U-boat-set 1981 film \u201cDas Boot\u201d was, appropriately, as inspiration for Fehlbaum.)",
      "The actors leaned into the same ethos. Magaro depended considerably on the anecdotes and advice of Mason who went on to have a decorated, decades-long career in television. With his help, Magaro sat in on CBS\u2019s Sunday NFL control room and games at Madison Square Garden to soak up the fast-paced atmosphere.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "In chronicling the minute-by-minute drama of covering the Munich terrorist attack, \u201cSeptember 5\u201d sidesteps the political repercussions of one the most infamous chapters of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The film was in post-production when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. It first debuted at film festivals last fall while the Israeli war in Gaza continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, raising hopes that the 15-month conflict could be nearing an end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said the agreement was still not complete.",
      "Yet \u201cSeptember 5\" strives to keep its focus on media, not politics.",
      "\u201cHas anything ever really changed? That conflict has been going on since 1948 when Israel was created,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, no matter what side you\u2019re on, you can ask yourself, even with the current situation: Is the media covering this the best way possible?\u201d",
      "Earlier foundational moments in the history of live news broadcasting stretch back to April 1949, when 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down an abandoned well in San Marino, California. KTLA in Los Angeles televised more than 27 hours of the rescue effort live.",
      "Today's media landscape, populated by social media and digital platforms that are often riddled with misinformation in some ways makes the ethical questions wrestled over in \u201cSeptember 5\u201d seem almost quaint. But for Fehlbaum, it's less about what's changed than what hasn't.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is that while technology changes a lot, the bigger ethical or moral questions are still the same,\u201d Fehlbaum says. \"For both those reporting on a crisis and us consuming news.\u201d"

      "Comedian and host Conan O\u2019Brien is the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

      "Walter Salles' film \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d tells the story of Eunice Paiva after the disappearance of her husband",
      "It\u2019s easy to fall in love with the Paiva family. Filmmaker Walter Salles makes sure of that in \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "He drops the audience into the warm everyday of the beautiful home of Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where their five kids run freely between the beach and their living room. Life is calmly chaotic, full of affection, gentle familial teasing and various life stages (one is about to lose a tooth, another about to go to university). Someone always seems to have wet hair, be covered in sand, or bringing in a mangy stray, as their youngest, Marcelo, does in the film\u2019s lovely opening. Even if their life is technically worlds away from any one person in the audience, it feels familiar and close.",
      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes.

      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.",
      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic. Aside from a few cartoonish flourishes, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is grounded in a working-class reality where every step toward upward mobility for Dreux and Alyssa is swiftly knocked backward.",
      "They live in a dilapidated apartment complex in the neighborhood of Baldwin Village, nicknamed the Jungles. When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",
      "Anyone familiar with Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d will recognize some of the hallmarks of that HBO series, namely the struggles of Black women trying to get a leg up in Los Angeles while also juggling romantic interests that might come from a wide range of backgrounds. Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them.

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG \u2014 the parent record label for Drake and Lamar \u2014 published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard and two attempted break-ins at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "The track is nominated for five Grammys, including record of the year and song of the year.",
      "UMG disputed the lawsuit's allegations in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2014 let alone Drake \u2014 is illogical,\" the company said. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d",
      "The company added: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music. \u201d",
      "Representatives for Lamar did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him. They said the shooting and break-in attempts at Drake's home, and the online vitriol, prompted him to move his family out of the house, and that he fears for his and their safety.",
      "\u201cBeginning on May 4, 2024 and every day since, UMG has used its massive resources as the world\u2019s most powerful music company to elevate a dangerous and inflammatory message that was designed to assassinate Drake\u2019s character, and led to actual violence at Drake\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit reveals the human and business consequences to UMG\u2019s elevation of profits over the safety and well-being of its artists, and shines a light on the manipulation of artists and the public for corporate gain,\u201d it said."

      "It will not, of course, because this is a Blumhouse movie called \u201cWolf Man.\u201d It will not be good for Blake and it will not be good for the audience. That's because this film is a terrible misfire using a classic movie monster poorly rebooted by the modern home of horror.",
      "Slack when it should be terrifying, \u201cWolf Man\u201d suffers from cheap sentimentality, laughably obvious script reveals, poor continuity and a creature that is less predatory than painful. Pity comes to mind.",
      "Christopher Abbott stars as Blake, a father and husband whose own estranged dad was a tad unstable, constantly drilling in his son a survivalist ethic. \u201cIt's not hard to die. It's the easiest thing in the world,\u201d his dad says. He being officially declared dead 30 years after he disappeared into the forest starts this sludgy movie off.",
      "\"The Invisible Man\" writer-director Leigh Whannell \u2014 who co-wrote the story with Corbett Tuck \u2014 seems to be attempting a horror movie with his new message: Being overprotective can lead to your family being assaulted by a deranged manbeast.

      "A weird human-animal hybrid lurking in the Oregon wilderness \u2014 actually New Zealand pretending to be Oregon \u2014 kicks off what is supposed to be the scary part of this movie, but so much time is spent on the domestic drama set-up that the audience will be bored by the time the supposed thrill ride shows up. When it does, the filmmakers lean on creepy sounds way too much.",
      "There's a Wolf Man out there and he's, well, underwhelming. He is largely unseen for most of the movie because seeing the monster is always a bad idea. At one, point, he attacks through the cabin's doggie door, one of the most disappointing assaults on film.",
      "Now infected inside their barricaded cabin, Blake goes through a body-horror transformation, which includes the sweats, enhanced hearing, uncontrolled peeing, teeth readjustment, mottled skin, being made mute and hair loss. That's right, hair loss. This is the first Wolf Man movie that seems to endorse Rogaine.",
      "His wife, played by Julia Garner, is left here to sniffle and shriek, going from life partner to potential dinner. That means a lot of running and panting with a flashlight in hand. Their daughter, played by Matilda Firth, earlier so precocious, now asks really stupid questions like \u201cWhat's happening?\u201d and \u201cWhat's wrong with Daddy?\u201d",

      "The 64-year-old author of \u201cThe Sandman\u201d comic book series and novel \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was responding to a New York Magazine article that detailed allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women. The allegations of four of them had been broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "Gaiman said he had watched stories about him circulate on the Internet for months with \u201chorror and dismay.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don\u2019t, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. I\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Gaiman said he had read back message exchanges he had had with his accusers. They still read like \u201ctwo people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships and wanting to see one another again,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd I also realise, looking through them, years later, that I could have and should have done so much better. I was emotionally unavailable while being sexually available, self-focused and not as thoughtful as I could or should have been. I was obviously careless with people\u2019s hearts and feelings, and that\u2019s something that I really, deeply regret,\u201d Gaiman said.",
      "Most of the allegations relate to occasions when Gaiman was in his 40s or older and living in the United States, Britain and New Zealand.",
      "One of the accusers, Scarlett Pavlovich, told New York Magazine she met Gaiman through his then-wife, U.S. performer Amanda Palmer, on a New Zealand island where the couple lived with their son in 2022. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman abused her several times starting the night they met.",
      "Some of Pavlovich\u2019s allegations were first made public six months earlier in the podcast.",
      "She told the magazine she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault.",
      "New Zealand Police this week would not say whether Gaiman was, or had been, under investigation.",
      "\u201cIn general, Police cannot respond to queries which seek to establish whether specific individuals are, or have been, under Police investigation. Additionally, anyone who makes a complaint to Police has the right to privacy,\u201d New Zealand Police told The Associated Press in an email on Tuesday.",
      "The AP\u2019s messages to Gaiman\u2019s agent, his office and to Bloomsbury, publisher of several of his recent books, were not returned.",
      "Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which both have Gaiman-related projects scheduled for this year, haven't responded to the AP\u2019s messages.",
      "Several of Gaiman's works have been turned into movies and television programs."

      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing",
      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles last Tuesday, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing. The Golden Globes had transpired less than 48 hours earlier and a series of splashy awards banquets followed in the days after.",
      "But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. At one point, the flames even encroached on the hillside above the Dolby Theatre, the home of the Academy Awards.",
      "The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",
      "\u201cWith ALL due respect during Hollywood\u2019s season of celebration, I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have gathered to victims of the fires and the firefighters,\u201d \u201cHacks\u201d star Jean Smart, a recent Globe winner, wrote on Instagram.",
      "The Oscars remain as scheduled, but it\u2019s certain that they will be transformed due to the wildfires, and that most of the red-carpet pomp that typically stretches between now and then will be curtailed if not altogether canceled. With so many left without a home by the fires, there\u2019s scant appetite for the usual self-congratulatory parades of the season.",
      "Focus has turned, instead, to what the Oscars might symbolize for a traumatized Los Angeles. The Oscars have never meant less, but, at the same time, they might be more important than ever as a beacon of perseverance for the reeling movie capital.",
      "The film academy on Monday for the second time delayed its nominations announcement. Nominations will now be announced virtually on Feb. 23. The academy also canceled its annual nominees luncheon and said it\u2019s planning to honor frontline workers and to support relief efforts.",
      "\u201cWe will get through this together and bring a sense of healing to our global film community,\u201d vowed Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, and Janet Yang, academy president.",
      "The fires, one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history, continue. The ongoing nature of the crisis, which has killed at least 25 people, has made remaking well-laid plans a moving target. The Critics Choice Awards have been postponed. Nominations to the Producers Guild Awards have been delayed twice with no new date set. On Tuesday, the guild established a fund to support producers affected by the fires.",
      "The 67th Grammy Awards, scheduled to be held Feb. 2 in downtown Los Angeles, are going forward, albeit with significant changes. Harvey Mason jr., Recording Academy chief executive and Board of Trustees chair Tammy Hurt said this year's Grammys \u201cwill carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d",
      "Some telethon-like element also seems sure to accompany the Oscars. In recent days, many throughout the industry have voiced suggestions for how the broadcast could be reconsidered. A not dissimilar process happened during the 2021 Oscars, which were postponed to late April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oscars have been moved a few times throughout history, including in 1938, when the show was delayed a week due to historic flooding in Los Angeles.",
      "For the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the wildfires have been acutely personal. Four of the academy\u2019s 55-person board of governors lost their homes, according to The Hollywood Reporter, including producer Lynette Howell Taylor, visual effects governor Brooke Breton, sound branch governor Mark P. Stoeckinger and animation branch governor Jinko Gotoh. The Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed by the fires, was home to many stars and executives.",
      "For potential nominees, this would normally be when they\u2019d be at their most active, campaigning in Q&As and other events tied to the all-important nominations voting period. All of that has ground to a halt. Isabella Rossellini, who\u2019s favored to be nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in \u201cConclave,\u201d on Instagram posted a photograph of an Oscar lying in ashes. The photo turned out to be fake, but it accurately captured Hollywood\u2019s current mood.",
      "Several high-profile TV series were forced to pause production because of the fires but notably few movie shoots were affected. That, in itself, is a reflection of a Hollywood that has seen the majority of film production seek tax incentives in other states.",
      "Work throughout the film and TV industry hasn\u2019t rebounded following the 2023 strikes, leaving large numbers of crew members unemployed. So quiet are studio lots that actress Natalie Morales (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) has advocated for studios, in the wake of the fires, to turn empty soundstages into temporary classrooms, erected by out-of-work craftspeople, for children whose schools burned down.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that many in the film business need all the work they can find, including all the jobs that accompany the Oscars. Not only are the Academy Awards a vital spotlight on a wide swath of movies that otherwise might struggle to find audiences, the awards provide a lot of jobs to an awards season industrial complex of workers, stylists and vendors.",
      "With so many out of work before the fires hit, Silvina Knight, an Emmy-winning makeup artist, calls this latest crisis \u201canother setback \u2013 a big one.\u201d She is currently working on \u201cSuits LA,\u201d one of the series that stopped filming due to the fires.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how people are going to feel about getting dressed up and when they just lost everything,\u201d said Knight of the Oscars. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, it might be a show of force when we come back. Yeah, this is tragic, but we are all coming together. Even driving home the other night, motorists were being very considerate of each other, which is unusual for Los Angeles.\u201d",

      "When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID. Not the best time for a film on a wholly different scourge.",
      "\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d the Oscar-nominated filmmaker says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t blame people for not wanting to watch a film about the fires in the middle of the pandemic, because it was just too much horror.\"",
      "And so the film, though acclaimed \u2014 it was named one of the 10 best films of the year by the New York Times \u2013 didn\u2019t reach an audience as large as Walker had hoped, with its urgent display of the human cost of wildfires and its tough, crucial questions for the future.",
      "That could change. Walker thinks people may now be more receptive to her message, given the devastating wildfires that have wrought havoc on Los Angeles itself the past week. Firefighters were preparing on Tuesday to attack new blazes amid warnings that winds combined with severely dry conditions created a \u201c particularly dangerous situation.\"",
      "\u201cThis is probably the moment where it becomes undeniable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "She added: \"It does feel like people are now asking the question that I was asking a few years ago, like, 'Is it safe to live in Los Angeles? And why is this happening, and what can we do about it? And the good news is that there are some things we can do about it. What\u2019s tricky is that they\u2019re really hard to accomplish.\u201d",
      "In \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\" (available on Paramount+), Walker portrays in sometimes terrifying detail the devastation caused by two wildfires on the same day in 2018, products of the same wind event \u2014 the Camp Fire that engulfed the northern California city of Paradise and the Woolsey fire in Malibu, two towns on opposite ends of the political and economic spectrum.",
      "She embeds herself with firefighters, and explores the lives of locals affected by the fire. She shares harrowing cellphone footage of people driving through exploding columns of fire as they try to escape, crying out \u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d She plays 911 calls in which people plead vainly for rescue as fire laps at their backyards or invades their homes.",
      "And she conveys a layered message: Devastating fires in California are increasingly inevitable. Climate change is a clear accelerating factor, yes, but it\u2019s not the only one, and therein lies an element of hope: There are things people can do, if they start to make different (and difficult) choices \u2014 in both where and how they choose to live.",
      "But first, complacency must be vanquished.",
      "\u201cComplacency sets in when there hasn\u2019t been a fire for a few years and you start to think, it might not happen again,\u201d Walker says.",
      "It even affected Walker herself a few months ago. A British transplant to Los Angeles, she had chosen to live on the Venice-Santa Monica border \u2014 too scared, she says, to live in the city's lovely hilly areas with small winding roads, surrounded by nature and vegetation, near the canyons that wildfires love.",
      "But a few months ago, she started wondering if over-anxiety about wildfires had incorrectly influenced her choice. And then, of course, came the Palisades catastrophe \u2014\u201cthis God awful reminder that it only takes one event,\u201d she says.",
      "Walker became interested in making a film about wildfires after she arrived in the city and wondered if she was safe. \u201cWhy is the hillside on fire?\u201d she says she wondered. \u201cWhy do people just keep on driving?\u201d She had considered such fires \u201ca medieval problem.\"",
      "One thing she learned while filming: Firefighters were even more impressive and courageous than she'd thought. \u201cIf you want to watch a firefighter have their heart broken, it\u2019s when they want to do more,\u201d she says. \"I was just absolutely wowed by how incredibly selfless and brilliant they were.\u201d",
      "Not that the public wasn\u2019t angry at them \u2014 her film depicts angry residents of Malibu, for example, chastising firefighters for not doing enough.",
      "One of the most stunning parts of \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\u201d \u2014 the title is a reference to the economic inequity of wealthy homeowners or celebrities like Kim Kardashian hiring private firefighters \u2014 is watching the reaction of firefighters at a town meeting in Paradise, where 85 people had been killed in the fire. They've convened to discuss adopting safety measures as they rebuild. One by one, measures are rejected \u2014 even the simplest, requiring a five-foot buffer around every house where nothing is flammable. Safety takes a back burner to individual choice.",
      "\u201cIt was very shocking to be at that meeting in particular, given that people had died in the most horrible way in that community. And you have firefighters with tears in their eyes saying, 'This is what we need to have happen to keep us safe, and then (they) get voted down.\"",
      "Walker is not the only filmmaker to have made a film about Paradise. In 2020, Ron Howard directed \u201cRebuilding Paradise,\u201d focused on the effort to rebuild, and the resilience of residents. Walker says she looked at the same set of facts and arrived at different takeaways.",
      "Townspeople were indeed amazing and resilient, Walker says. \u201cBut are we right to be building back without a real rethink? Because the tragedy is that these fires are predictably going to be repeating and against the backdrop of climate change, they're getting worse, not better.\u201d",
      "That rethink involves making hard calls about where people should live. \u201cThe population is overwhelmingly moving into these wildland urban interface areas,\u201d Walker says, referring to areas where housing meets undeveloped wildland vegetation \u2014 exactly the areas most likely to burn.",
      "In California, some of these places are very expensive \u2014 like Palisades and Malibu \u2014 but others are in more affordable areas. With the great pressure on housing, more people are moving into such areas, she says. But the \u201cbraking mechanism\u201d could be that insurance companies \u201care doing the math, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",
      "It's not only a question of where people live.",
      "\u201cWhat does a fire-hardened home look like?\u201d Walker asks. \u201cDesign-wise, that that does dictate certain things.\u201d For example: \u201cThis lovely wood is going to require tremendous firefighting.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s too early to know, but Walker thinks she may be hearing something different now from those who've lost homes, of whom she knows many.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from people is not just \u2018I can\u2019t wait to rebuild. Let me rebuild,'\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s: 'How could we go through that again?'\u201d"

      "The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that\u2019s consistent with these stretches because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.\u201d",
      "It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius). Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Kemp's announcement came as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and more state and federal officials consider Medicaid work requirements.",
      "Georgia is the only state that requires some people to work, study or volunteer to enroll in Medicaid, under the program Georgia Pathways. If the incoming Trump administration approves Kemp's plan, parents and guardians of kids up to age 6 in households at or below 100% of the federal poverty level could receive Medicaid without meeting those requirements.",
      "\u201cIn a growing state that needs more Georgians in the workforce than ever before, providing health insurance to a family or individual with young children may be the last piece they need to restart a career and be on the path for a brighter future,\u201d Kemp said.",
      "Most states cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level with primarily federal funds. Kemp has championed Georgia Pathways as an alternative to expanding Medicaid for low-income adults. Enrollees have to complete 80 hours of work, volunteer activity, schooling or vocational rehabilitation a month to receive coverage. Kemp says the goal is to ease them into a job that provides private insurance.",
      "Georgia Pathways had a rough start. After its first year, the program had around 4,300 members, a sliver of those who are eligible. Health policy experts have called the program a \u201cfailure,\" saying the requirements are too burdensome a large number of struggling people.",
      "Opponents also say the program has wasted money. Nonprofit health policy research organization KFF reports the program has costed more than $40 million in state and federal tax dollars that have been spent mostly on administrative costs rather than medical care. Others complain about sign-up complications and the program's slow processing times.",
      "In a written statement, state Senate Democrats called the new plan \u201cdamage control\u201d for the Georgia Pathways program.",
      "\u201cThere are over half a million Georgians who need health insurance, and the governor\u2019s proposal falls well short of that, and we\u2019re leaving federal dollars on the table that would help close the coverage gap in Georgia,\" said Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves, of Atlanta. \"Because of the governor\u2019s plan, we will continue to struggle to strengthen our healthcare system.\"",
      "Kemp has regularly doubled down on his commitment to Georgia Pathways.",
      "\u201cThe old system is not working,\u201d Kemp said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the other side, their only answer to any of this is they want government-run healthcare. And I am not in that boat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirement plans in 13 states, but the Biden administration revoked these waivers in 2021. Georgia Pathways survived after a legal fight.",
      "Kemp will have to get approval for his plans from the Trump administration, as the program is set to expire in September. Talks are already underway, Kemp said, calling the incoming administration a \u201cfederal partner that wants to innovate efficiently.\u201d",
      "He said the Biden administration has meanwhile \u201cunfortunately been more interested in finding ways to stop or undermine our efforts rather than working with us.\u201d",
      "Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said the governor's new plan would cost an additional $207,000. In an effort to boost enrollment, the state recently invested $10.7 million to raise awareness about Georgia Pathways.",

      "U.S. regulators are banning the dye called Red 3 from the food supply",
      "U.S. regulators on Wednesday banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.",
      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",
      "\u201cWhen we do ban something, it will go to court,\u201d he told members of Congress on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd if we don't have the scientific evidence, we will lose in court.\u201d",
      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \"the FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.",
      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",
      "Lawmakers cited the Delaney Clause and said the action was especially important to protect children, who consume more of the dye on a bodyweight basis than adults, the lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cThe FDA should act quickly to protect the nation's youth from this harmful dye, used simply to give food and drinks a bright red color,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNo aesthetic reason could justify the use of a carcinogen in our food supply.\u201d",
      "Red 3 is banned for food use in Europe, Australia and New Zealand except in certain kinds of cherries. The dye will be banned in California starting in January 2027.",
      "The International Association of Color Manufacturers defends the dye, saying that it is safe in levels typically consumed by humans. The group points to research by scientific committees operated by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that reaffirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.",
      "Some food manufacturers have already reformulated products to remove Red 3. In its place they use beet juice; carmine, a dye made from insects; and pigments from foods such as purple sweet potato, radish and red cabbage, according to Sensient Food Colors, a St. Louis-based supplier of food colors and flavorings.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",

      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, MD, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "",
      "An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a healthcare consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",

      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",

      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",

      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",

      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",

      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",

      "",
      "In a phone interview with MedPage Today while out on the strike line, Jennifer Lincoln, MD, an ob/gyn at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center in Portland, noted that \"the support out here has been amazing.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's not just nurses and doctors ... it's community members,\" she said. \"We know that the community has our back because we have their back.\"",

      "At the same time, she acknowledged that she and her colleagues were \"hopeful that we wouldn't get here,\" noting that they never left the bargaining table with Providence. (Providence St. Vincent hospitalists won their election to unionize with the Pacific Northwest Hospital Medicine Association in August 2023 and have been bargaining since January 2024, according to the ONA.)",
      "",
      "Indeed, as of Thursday afternoon, the ONA and several of the striking healthcare professionals said during a press conference that there was still time to avert a Friday morning strike.

      "",
      "As the strike continues, the ONA issued a note to patients on behalf on their healthcare providers: \"If you are sick, please do not delay getting medical care. Patients who need hospital or clinical care immediately should go to receive care.\"",
      "",
      "\"We would prefer to provide your care ourselves, but Providence executives' refusal to continue meeting with caregivers has forced us onto the picket line to advocate for you, our communities, and our colleagues,\" the statement continued. \"Going into a hospital or clinic to get the care you need is not crossing our strike line. We invite you to come join us on the strike line after you've received the care you need.\"",

      "While many of the germs that cause this misery can circulate throughout the year, scientists think that the winter surge of flu and cold activity may be because we spend more time indoors and the cold, dry air may weaken our defenses.",
      "But knowing what these bugs are and how they spread can help. While it may be difficult to make it through the season totally unscathed, there are some things you can do to protect yourself from these respiratory and stomach viruses.",
      "Some symptoms are hard to distinguish among illnesses, especially with respiratory viruses. Others are unmistakable.",
      "\u2014 Norovirus is a foodborne illness that can spread through water and contaminated surfaces and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and stomach pain for about one to three days.",
      "\u2014 The common cold can be caused by several different types of viruses and can cause a runny nose, congestion, cough, sneezing, sore throat, headaches, body aches or low fever for less than a week.",
      "\u2014 The flu, caused by influenza viruses that are always changing, leads to fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches and feeling tired. Flu symptoms tend to hit more quickly than cold symptoms, and can last anywhere from a few days to two weeks.",

      "This is especially true after using the bathroom and eating or preparing food, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "Don't speed through it, either. Count to 20, slowly, while you scrub away.",
      "If you don't have access to soap and water, try a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol \u2014 though that isn't enough to wipe out norovirus.",
      "If norovirus has found you, you'll want to immediately clean surfaces that came in contact with contaminated food or bodily fluids. The CDC recommends disinfecting things with a chlorine bleach solution or one of the products listed on this Environmental Protection Agency website.",
      "Don't forget to wash any clothing that came in contact with vomit or feces \u2014 use hot water and detergent. Then, wash your hands. Again.",

      "Use household cleaning products that contain soap or detergent, and follow it up with a sanitizer. The CDC has more tips on how to clean.",
      "COVID-19 generally spreads through the air from droplets and particles, and the CDC says the risk of getting the virus from a contaminated surface is low.",
      "Viruses can spread through talking, coughing and sneezing, so cover your mouth with a tissue if you feel a tickle in your throat or your nose. Then, wash your hands. Again.",
      "Also, even if you're not sick, consider masking in crowded areas with an N95 or medical-grade mask to protect yourself from respiratory viruses.",
      "Don't touch your face: If you have a germ or virus on your unwashed hands \u2014 respiratory or norovirus \u2014 and touch your face, eyes or nose, it can get into your mucus membranes and, voila!, you're sick!",

      "But there is no vaccine for norovirus or the common cold.",
      "Your immune system may not work as well if you're sleep-deprived, stressed out or dehydrated. So don't grind yourself into the ground if you can help it. Rest. Sleep. Drink water.",
      "If you do get sick, prompt testing can help determine whether you have COVID-19 or influenza. That\u2019s important to see if you need one of the medicines that can help prevent severe illness: Paxlovid for COVID-19 and Tamiflu for flu.",
      "Above all, if you're symptomatic, stay at home to keep from getting others sick.",
      "To treat a cold, flu or COVID-19, rest and drink fluids. You can take pain relievers to lower a fever or help with an achy body. Humidifiers can help with symptoms, too.",
      "There's no medication for norovirus. Instead, you'll need to rehydrate as much as possible with water and other liquids. Seek help if you are dehydrated and notice you have a dry mouth and throat, aren't urinating as much or feel dizzy when you're standing up.",

      "Ferrer, a strong opponent of the island's communist government, confirmed to The Associated Press he was freed and that he was at home in Palma Soriano, a town in the province of Santiago, more than 600 miles east of Havana.",
      "\u201cI am fine, surrounded by family and friends,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cI had been arbitrarily imprisoned for the third time, and a false judicial process had been set up.\u201d",

      "The illustration, not in video format, shows a plane superimposed over the French flag and tilted toward the Paris landmark, with the words \u201cParis, we're coming today.\u201d",
      "The ad was posted on X by Pakistan International Airlines, or PIA, on Jan. 10, the day that the company resumed flights to European Union countries after a four-year ban by the bloc's aviation safety agency.",
      "Many social media users immediately decried the ad, and Pakistan's prime minister called for an inquiry. On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar described the ad as an act of \u201cstupidity.\u201d",
      "PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez said Thursday that the ad, which hasn't been deleted and has more than 21.2 million views, was only ever meant to celebrate that the airline was resuming flights to Europe, and never intended to harm 9/11 survivors or victims' families.",
      "Hafeez told The Associated Press that he was surprised over the criticism. But he said that \u201cwe apologize to those who feel the advertisement hurt them.",
      "\u201cWe want to make it clear that we had no intention to hurt the feelings of anyone,\" Hafeez said.",
      "He said that the Eifel Tower was shown in the ad because it's one of the best places in the world.",
      "Curbs on PIA had been imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said that an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot\u2019s exams. A government investigation later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.",
      "The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.",
      "Pakistan has some connections to the Sept. 11 attacks. One of the 9/11 masterminds, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was detained in the country in 2003. In 2011, Osama bin Laden was killed in a U.S. special forces raid in Pakistan."

      "Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed entire neighborhoods in several cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching away in all directions. Major roads have been plowed up. Critical water and electricity infrastructure is in ruins. Most hospitals no longer function.",
      "And it's unclear when \u2014 or even if \u2014 much will be rebuilt.",
      "The agreement for a phased ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas-led militants does not say who will govern Gaza after the war, or whether Israel and Egypt will lift a blockade limiting the movement of people and goods that they imposed when Hamas seized power in 2007.",
      "The United Nations says that it could take more than 350 years to rebuild if the blockade remains.",
      "The full extent of the damage will only be known when the fighting ends and inspectors have full access to the territory. The most heavily destroyed part of Gaza, in the north, has been sealed off and largely depopulated by Israeli forces in an operation that began in early October.",
      "Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including over 245,000 homes. The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage \u2014 nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022 \u2014 from just the first four months of the war.",
      "Israel blames the destruction on Hamas, which ignited the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The military has released photos and video footage showing that Hamas built tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas, and often operated in and around homes, schools and mosques.",
      "Before anything can be rebuilt, the rubble must be removed \u2014 a staggering task in itself.",
      "The U.N. estimates that the war has littered Gaza with over 50 million tons of rubble \u2014 roughly 12 times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. With over 100 trucks working full time, it would take over 15 years to clear the rubble away, and there is little open space in the narrow coastal territory that is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians.",
      "Carting the debris away will also be complicated by the fact that it contains huge amounts of unexploded ordnance and other harmful materials, as well as human remains. Gaza's Health Ministry says thousands of people killed in airstrikes are still buried under the rubble.",
      "The rubble clearance and eventual rebuilding of homes will require billions of dollars and the ability to bring construction materials and heavy equipment into the territory \u2014 neither of which are assured.",
      "The ceasefire agreement calls for a 3-5 year reconstruction project to begin in its final phase, after all the remaining 100 hostages have been released and Israeli troops have withdrawn from the territory.",
      "But getting to that point will require agreement on the second and most difficult phase of the agreement, which still must be negotiated. And even the first phase was in doubt on Thursday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office saying a last-minute dispute with Hamas was holding up Israeli approval.",
      "Even then, the ability to rebuild will depend on the blockade, which critics have long decried as a form of collective punishment. Israel says it is needed to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its military capabilities, noting that cement and metal pipes can also be used for tunnels and rockets.",
      "Israel might be more inclined to lift the blockade if Hamas were no longer in power, but there are no plans for an alternative government.",
      "The United States and much of the international community want a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern the West Bank and Gaza with the support of Arab countries ahead of eventual statehood. But that's a nonstarter for Israel's government, which is opposed to a Palestinian state and has ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed authority.",
      "International donors are unlikely to invest in an ungoverned territory that has seen five wars in less than two decades, which means the sprawling tent camps along the coast could become a permanent feature of life in Gaza.",

      "For decades, the Syrian-Israeli border remained largely quiet under a 1974 Disengagement Agreement, which established a U.N.-patrolled demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries after a war they fought the year before.",
      "However, after Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s ouster on Dec. 8, Israeli forces entered the buffer zone, calling it a temporary move to block hostile forces. The move drew criticism and protests from local residents and Arab countries.",

Israeli foreces have also made incursions into areas outside the buffer zone, sparking protests.",
      "\"These areas belong to the Syrian people, not the regime, and we must defend our homeland.

    "story": [
      "The British government says it will support a series of local inquiries into organized child sexual abuse in the wake of a furor largely stoked by the world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk",
      "LONDON -- Britain's government said Thursday that it will support a series of local inquiries into cases of organized child sexual abuse in the wake of a furor largely stoked by the world's richest man Elon Musk.",
      "In a statement to lawmakers, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government has also authorized what she called a \u201crapid audit\u201d of the \u201ccurrent scale and nature of gang-based exploitation across the country\u201d and make recommendations.",
      "The issue of so-called \u201cgrooming gangs,\" also called \u201crape gangs\" by some, has risen up the political agenda in the U.K. after Musk recently took to his X platform highlighting the problem and condemning British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk criticized Starmer for not backing a national inquiry into the matter following a request from the local authority in the northern English town of Oldham, where police found girls under 18 were sexually exploited by groups of men in the 2000s and 2010s. Musk also alleged that Starmer failed to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England\u2019s chief prosecutor between 2008 and 2013, a charge that the prime minister vigorously denied.",
      "Because the cases in Oldham and similar ones in several other towns involved predominantly white girls abused by men largely from Pakistani backgrounds, the issue has been used by far-right activists to link child sexual abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the crimes out of a fear of appearing racist.",
      "The decision to back a local inquiry in Oldham and four other areas is a shift in the government's position. It had previously indicated that there was no need for further investigations following a string of previous inquiries, both local and national.",
      "\u201cI hope this is a proper investigation,\u201d Musk said on X in response to the government\u2019s decision.",
      "A seven-year inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, but many of the 20 recommendations it made in 2022 \u2014 including compensation for abuse victims \u2014 have yet to be implemented.",
      "Cooper confirmed Thursday that the government will act on them as soon as possible, adding that \u201cmuch valuable time has already been lost\u201d since the final report was published, \u201ccausing even more trauma to many victims and survivors.\u201d",
      "Cooper said the government will provide 10 million pounds ($12.5 million) to support its announcement, half of which will go to the inquiries.",
      "\u201cAs we have seen, effective local inquiries can delve into far more local detail and deliver more locally relevant answers, and change, than a lengthy nationwide inquiry can provide,\" she said.",
      "The main opposition Conservative Party said Cooper's measures aren't sufficient as there are around 50 areas that have suffered from grooming gangs. It also voiced worries that the local inquires won't be able to summon witnesses, something a national inquiry would have been able to."

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Two Cambodian deminers were killed Thursday as they attempted to remove an anti-tank mine left over from the country's nearly three decades of war and disorder, authorities said.",
      "The Cambodian Mines Action Center, the agency that oversees demining operations, said the two men had been working to clear mines from a farmer\u2019s rice field in northwestern Oddar Meanchey province, which was an area of heavy fighting between the government and insurgent Khmer Rouge forces in the 1980s.",
      "The two, identified as Pov Nepin and Ouen Channara, died at the scene after the mine they were working on removing exploded, the agency said.",

      "Since the end of the fighting in Cambodia, nearly 20,000 people have been killed and about 45,000 have been injured by leftover war explosives.",
      "As extensive work has continued on getting rid of the mines and unexploded ordnance, casualties have dropped from 858 in 2000 to 32 in 2023, according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines' 2024 annual report.",
      "Cambodian deminers are among the world\u2019s most experienced, and several thousand have been sent in the past decade under U.N. auspices to work in Africa and the Middle East. Cambodia in 2022 began training deminers from Ukraine, which has been suffering from a growing number of landmines and other unexploded munitions since the full-scale Russian invasion in February of that year."

      "After forging unexpectedly fond ties with President Biden, Italy\u2019s right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni is poised to leverage a more natural alliance with incoming President Trump that positions her as a key interlocutor between the U.S. and Europe",
      "ROME -- After forging unexpectedly fond ties with U.S. President Joe Biden, Italy\u2019s right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni is poised to leverage a more natural alliance with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that positions her as a key interlocutor between the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Weeks before his inauguration, Meloni met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago retreat, a visit that she said went \u201cbeyond expectations.\u201d The trip, she said, \"was an opportunity to confirm a relationship that promises to be very solid,\u2019\u2019 adding diplomatically, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can say privileged.\u201d",
      "A strong trans-Atlantic relationship between two conservative governments creates \u201can added value, not only for Italy but for Europe as a whole,\u2019\u2019 she told journalists this month.",
      "It remains to be seen to whose advantage the relationship will be, with some observers saying that Meloni could either become a Trump whisperer, exerting influence, or a Trojan horse in Europe \u2014 for Trump\u2019s purposes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that if Trump is looking for a person to call in Europe when in need, Meloni is the one,\u201d said Franco Pavoncello, political science professor and president of Rome\u2019s John Cabot University. \u201cAround her in Europe, it's a desert.\u201d",
      "Known for its rotating governments that rarely complete full parliamentary terms, Italy is in the unusual position of being the most stable government among major European and G-7 allies, as Germany, France and even Canada struggle.",
      "Meloni has led her once-fringe, post-fascist party from the extreme right to more mainstream positions, especially on foreign policy. She gained ground as a leading political figure in Europe after her far-right Brothers of Italy party scored a sound performance in the EU election last June.",
      "The 48-year-old Italian leader made the trip to Florida as her government was working to win the release from Iran of an Italian journalist who was arrested in mid-December. Within days of her return, the journalist, Cecilia Sala, was released in what Meloni described as \u201cdiplomatic triangulation\u201d between the U.S., Italy and Iran. Four days later, Italy freed an Iranian citizen held on a U.S. warrant.",
      "While Meloni denied any direct Trump involvement in the deal, her defense minister said the images of Meloni standing alongside him reinforced her \u201ccredibility\u201d at a critical juncture.",
      "On ideological grounds, Meloni is a natural ally for the incoming U.S. president. She has taken on migration, seeking deals with African nations to discourage departures and is determined to vet male asylum seekers at two centers Italy built in Albania. Her government also has adopted conservative family policies, including a ban on surrogacy and has taken action meant to curb abortions.",
      "The personal chemistry between Trump and Meloni is also evident and reinforces her chances to become his go-to leader in Europe. The two were seen locked in discussions during celebrations for the reopening of Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral on Dec. 7, when they set in motion the Mar-a-Lago visit. Meloni also has a well-documented friendship with key Trump adviser, Elon Musk.",
      "The Italian prime minister is one of just a handful of world leaders who will likely attend Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, confirming the strong ties with the U.S. administration.",
      "More surprising was Meloni\u2019s strong relationship with Biden, who initially viewed Meloni\u2019s rise to power as a harbinger of a rightward shift in global politics. But Biden\u2019s concerns about her ideology were eased by her support for Ukraine in its effort to repel Russia\u2019s grinding invasion and her openness to pulling back from Italy\u2019s participation in China\u2019s infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative.",
      "The two met at least twice in Washington, highly unusual for an Italian leader in just two years in office. Biden had even planned to make his last overseas trip as president this month to Italy. That trip, however, was scrapped at the last minute so Biden could stay in Washington to oversee the federal response to wildfires devastating Los Angeles.",
      "Instead, Biden and Meloni spoke by phone last Friday. The White House said Biden expressed his appreciation to Meloni for Italy\u2019s support for Ukraine as well as the country\u2019s leadership at the G7, NATO and European Union.",
      "Meloni\u2019s pro-Atlantic position, which secured her ties with Biden, may prove a challenge to a Trump relationship. Trump is pushing NATO allies to increase their spending to 5% of national output, with Italy one of just eight members that falls below the 2% defense spending target.",
      "\u201cOn Ukraine, the Trump administration will try to find a way to dialogue with Russia to reach a solution and will likely ask Europe to do more,\u201d said Mario Del Pero, expert of transatlantic relations and professor of international history at SciencesPo in Paris. \u201cThat will put Italy in a tough spot.\u201d",
      "Meloni has already been forced to comment on Trump\u2019s recent expansionist rhetoric, telling reporters that his comments about annexing Greenland, Canada and Panama were meant as a deterrent, a \u201cforceful message to other big global players rather than a hostile action.\u201d",
      "Italy\u2019s economy would also be challenged by Trump\u2019s pledge of tariffs on exports, which at 10% could cost Italy's export-driven economy up to $7 billion, according to a study by the Prometeia risk analysis firm. Italy has a trade surplus of 42 billion euros with the United States, its second export partner after Germany.",
      "The bottom line, according to analysts, is that Meloni remains a true nationalist, who will protect Italian interests before all else.",
      "That could turn in Europe\u2019s favor, for example in the case of trade tariff wars or defense spending clashes. But it may prove disruptive for European unity in the long term.",
      "Already a reported deal with Musk's SpaceX to provide communications through the Starlink technology to Italian institutions threatens to undermine the Iris2 orbital constellation of 290 satellites led by a European consortium that includes Italian defense contractor Leonardo.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s naive to imagine that she\u2019ll be able to defend EU interests, while she will more likely act as a Trojan horse for Trump into Europe,\u201d said Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome-based Institute of International Affairs. \u201cWhen she faces tough choices, the euro-skeptic way is where she always ends up going, because it\u2019s where her heart truly beats.\u201d",

      "The U.K., one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backers, has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($16 billion) in military and civilian aid since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago, and has trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Starmer is to announce another 40 million pounds ($49 million) for Ukraine\u2019s postwar economic recovery.",
      "But the U.K.\u2019s role is dwarfed by that of the United States, and there is deep uncertainty over the fate of American support for Ukraine once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The president-elect has balked at the cost of U.S. aid to Kyiv, says he wants to bring the war to a swift end and is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long expressed admiration.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war.",
      "Zelenskyy has said that in any peace negotiation, Ukraine would need assurances about its future protection from its much bigger neighbor.",
      "Britain says its 100-year pledge is part of that assurance and will help ensure Ukraine is \u201cnever again vulnerable to the kind of brutality inflicted on it by Russia,\u201d which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and attempted a full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "The deal commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Batlic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure. Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level,\u201d Starmer said ahead of the visit.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy says he and Starmer also will discuss a plan proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron that would see troops from France and other Western countries stationed in Ukraine to oversee a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Zelenskyy has said any such proposal should go alongside a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO. The alliance\u2019s 32 member countries say that Ukraine will join one day, but not until after the war. Trump has appeared to sympathize with Putin\u2019s position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO.",
      "As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains ahead of possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.",
      "Moscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties along the 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine\u2019s energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter. A major Russian ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine on Wednesday compelled authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas.",

      "Lawyers representing South Korea\u2019s impeached president say he will refuse further questioning after being detained by anti-corruption officials over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month, maintaining that the investigation is illegal",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lawyers representing South Korea\u2019s impeached president said Thursday he will refuse further questioning after being detained by anti-corruption officials over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month, maintaining that the investigation is illegal.",
      "President Yoon Suk Yeol exercised his right to remain silent as he underwent more than 10 hours of questioning on Wednesday at the headquarters of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, following a massive law enforcement operation to detain him at his official residence in Seoul.",
      "Investigators are expected to move to place him under arrest in the coming days.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with the police and the military over whether Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration amounted to attempted rebellion, has 48 hours either to request a court order for his formal arrest or to release him.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have argued that the detention warrant issued by the Seoul Western District Court is invalid and have asked the Seoul Central District Court to consider his release.",
      "The clock for the arrest warrant is on hold while the court reviews his petition, which can take up to 48 hours. There is a possibility that Yoon could attend a hearing at the Central District Court as part of the review. Court records showed that the hearing was set for 5 p.m. Thursday, indicating that the decision could come sometime during the evening.",
      "Yoon set off the country's most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s when he attempted to break through gridlock in legislation by declaring martial law and deploying troops around the National Assembly on Dec. 3. The standoff lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.",
      "His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion. His fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberating on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reject the charges and reinstate him.",
      "Yoon and his allies have defied efforts to investigate his role in the chaos of Dec. 3. He ignored requests to appear for questioning for weeks, remaining in his official residence to avoid detention as his lawyers turned away police, citing a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 Yoon himself. They also said that the anti-corruption agency had no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations.",
      "Yoon also resisted one attempt to detain him as the presidential security service barricaded the residence. He was finally brought into custody after hundreds of anti-corruption investigators and police raided the presidential compound for some five hours in a second attempt.",
      "In a video message recorded shortly before he was escorted to the headquarters of the anti-corruption agency, Yoon lamented that the \u201crule of law has completely collapsed in this country.\u201d He echoed the arguments of his lawyers that the anti-corruption agency does not have the authority to investigate his actions, but said he accepted detention to prevent violence.",
      "The Constitutional Court rejected a request by Yoon's lawyers to postpone a hearing on his case scheduled for Thursday. It remains possible for Yoon to exercise his right to attend, even while under detention.",
      "If a court grants a warrant for Yoon\u2019s formal arrest, the anti-corruption investigators can extend his detention to 20 days, during which it will transfer the case to public prosecutors for an indictment.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on the possible charges of rebellion and abuse of power, he could remain under arrest until the first court ruling, which is typically made within six months, said Park Sung-bae, an attorney specializing in criminal law. Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted."

      "HAVANA -- Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden's administration announced his intent to lift the U.S. designation of the island nation as a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes \u2014 and some of them were arrested after taking part in the historic 2021 protests \u2014 were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following the cases of detainees on the island.",

      "Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez did not mention the release on Wednesday \u2014 consistent with his stance the day before, indicating they were separate issues \u2014 but mentioned removing Cuba from the list of states sponsors of terrorism.",

      "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose last week, but layoffs remain historically low and the job market broadly healthy",
      "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose last week, but layoffs remain historically low and the job market broadly healthy.",
      "Applications for jobless benefits rose by 14,000 for the week ending January 11, the Labor Department said Thursday, up from the previous week\u2019s 203,000. The previous week's figure was the lowest since February of last year.",
      "The four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, dipped by 750 to 212,750.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of January 4 fell to by 18,000 to 1.86 million.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs.",
      "Though some signs of labor market weakness surfaced in 2024, jobs are still plentiful and layoffs historically low.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department reported that job growth in December surged and unemployment fell. Employers added 256,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.",
      "The final jobs report of 2024 underscores that the economy and hiring were able to grow at a solid pace even with interest rates much higher than they were before the pandemic. As a result, the Federal Reserve could be much less likely to cut borrowing costs again in the coming months after issuing three cuts late in 2024.",
      "Overall, the solid jobs figures suggest the economy is entering a post-COVID period of steady growth, higher interest rates, low unemployment, and slightly elevated inflation.",
      "Also last week, the government reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in November, showing companies are still looking for workers even as the labor market has loosened. Openings rose to 8.1 million in November, the most since February and up from 7.8 million in October,",

      "Shares of the health care giant slid early Thursday after it released its first financial report since the brazen shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel touched a national nerve and brought to the surface American frustration over health care access.",

      "Prosecutors have said Mangione, who was not a UnitedHealthcare customer, was carrying a notebook expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and especially wealthy executives when he was arrested.",

      "The W",
      "La June Montgomery Tabron believes many Americans have a desire for racial healing. They just don\u2019t know how to start.",
      "\u201cIt may sound mysterious or challenging,\u201d said Montgomery Tabron, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation\u2019s first woman and first Black CEO. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually quite simple.\u201d",
      "It starts, she says, with a conversation \u2014 with the sharing of stories between people of different backgrounds so they can better understand each other. So when Montgomery Tabron set out to explain the foundation\u2019s \u201cTruth, Racial Healing & Transformation\u201d work and its creation of the annual National Day of Racial Healing, set for Jan. 21 this year, she realized she should do it by sharing her own story.",
      "That\u2019s what she does in a pair of books released earlier this month \u2014\u201cHow We Heal: A Journey Toward Truth, Racial Healing and Community Transformation from the Inside Out,\u201d a memoir tracing the steps from her Detroit childhood to leading one of philanthropy\u2019s most prestigious foundations, and \u201cOur Differences Make Us Stronger,\u201d a children\u2019s book about connecting with others outside our comfort zones.",
      "\u201cI wanted to use the methodology of healing that we use, which is through storytelling,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people relate through stories. And this became a book of very interconnected stories.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press recently spoke with Montgomery Tabron about her books and the Kellogg Foundation\u2019s racial healing work. The interview was edited for clarity and length.",
      "Yes. There were several places across our portfolio where we had the same reaction: Had it not been for the healing work, a situation could have escalated, particularly in Buffalo. Not only was that work about connecting people, it also was about affirming everyone as part of the process, affirming everyone\u2019s value. They felt it was a moment to show up in a very different way that honors healing. It was about the grounding in their humanity and using those principles of trust and mutual respect and shared understanding as a way to express their own grief and healing in that moment.",
      "It was a process. In many ways, it was cathartic because my own healing journey happened also during the writing of the book. I touched on moments in my life that I had not totally processed or really fully healed from. There\u2019s nothing like going through the healing journey that you\u2019re writing about. I think it brings a level of authenticity to the writing itself.",
      "It was, but that made it even more important for me to do so. I wish I had such a book at that stage of my life, so I\u2019m telling the story. But more importantly, I\u2019m sharing the power of healing with a very young audience that I believe will help them navigate the nation and the world.",
      "Teaching young people how to communicate across differences and showing them that it can result in strong relationships and shared understanding is the beginning of the work. It\u2019s work that, for those who practice, can lead to making connections and building strong and trusting relationships. I hope we also find that we (adults) can do it as well. It\u2019s not too late to have these conversations, and, particularly in this moment, is imperative that we have them.",
      "I think it is calling for this more than ever. When I think about the attacks on DEI, I attribute the attacks to a lack of understanding, a lack of shared purpose and an empathy gap. And what the book speaks about is exactly how those types of disagreements need to be reconciled and can be reconciled through a healing process and healing conversation. I believe that through dialogue we can come closer to understanding why there would be such an attack and have a conversation about whether there is shared faith underneath that would align us and take us to a different place, where you resolve the issue. So I look at that particular issue and say it needs a healing framework just as much as many of the most important conversations we\u2019re having in this nation right now.",
      "What we\u2019ve always hoped is for people to take action. And we hope that both books can be used as tools to show what action looks like. We want people to begin to not only hear and understand my story but see their story in the book and understand that part of this process is telling your story and having comfort in telling your truth, regardless of whether it may or may not align with someone else\u2019s story. We then want them to take collective action. What can we do together within our family, within our community, within our organization, across our friend groups? What can we do to help others and join in to help others see through conversation and dialogue that there are other pathways that maybe they haven\u2019t envisioned themselves?",

      "The founder of the muckraking financial research firm Hindenburg Research says he is disbanding the organization after finishing the work it set out to do",
      "BANGKOK -- Nate Anderson, the founder of the muckraking financial information firm Hindenburg Research, says he is disbanding the organization after it finished the pipeline of work it set out to do.",
      "Hindenburg, founded in 2017, has a track record of sending the stock prices of its targets tumbling by disclosing fraud and other abuses that it has unearthed through deep forensic financial research. It had a financial incentive to do so, using a trading technique called short-selling to make money if its reports caused stock and bond prices of its targeted companies to fall.",
      "In one of its dozens of projects, it focused on the Indian conglomerate Adani Group, accusing it of \u201ca brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme.\u201d Hindenburg cited two years of research, including talks with former Adani senior executives and reviews of thousands of documents. Adani has challenged the allegations, which caused share prices of its group companies to plunge.",
      "In another case, Hindenburg Research questioned the number of pre-orders that startup electric truck maker Lordstown Motors had reported for its Endurance model, leading to a shakeup in its management. The automaker has been struggling and sold a huge auto assembly plant in Ohio to Taiwan iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to alleviate its financial woes.",
      "Anderson said in a letter posted in X, or Twitter, late Wednesday that he was \u201cwriting this from a place of joy,\u201d but that Hindenburg was a chapter in his life, \u201cnot a central thing that defines me.\u201d",
      "He said there was no specific reason for choosing to quit, though the intensity and focus of the work had come at the cost of missing people and experiences. The next step is to work on providing open source information about how Hindenburg conducted its investigations, he said.",
      "\u201cTo my family and friends, I'm sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can't wait to have more time to share with you together,\u201d he said.",
      "Anderson said he would work to ensure the people on his team would \u201cland where they want to be next.\u201d Some plan to start their own research firm, which he will not be involved with. Some others will be \u201cfree agents.\u201d",
      "He said that nearly 100 people had faced criminal or civil charges by regulators at least partly due to Hindenburg\u2019s work, which focused on accounting irregularities, illegal or unethical business or financial reporting practices and other undisclosed regulatory, product or financial issues.",
      "One of its most famous reports was a 2020 expose on Nikola, a company in the electric-vehicle industry whose founder Hindenburg said made misleading claims to ink partnerships with top auto companies hungry to catch up to Tesla.",
      "Among its allegations, Hindenburg accused Nikola of staging a video to calm skepticism about its truck, one that showed the vehicle cruising on a road. Hindenburg said the video was actually just showing the truck rolling down a hill after getting towed to the top.",
      "In late 2021, Nikola agreed to pay $125 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it defrauded investors by misleading them about its products, technical advancements, and commercial prospects.",
      "Anderson praised his team of 11 people who he said are smart, focused and \u201cvery nice and polite,\u201d but at the same time are \u201cruthless assassins, capable of world-class work.\u201d",
      "The firm says it sees the Hindenburg, the airship that famously caught fire in the 1930s to the cry of \u201cOh, the humanity,\u201d as the \u201cepitome of a totally man-made, totally avoidable disaster.\u201d It says it looks for similar disasters in financial markets \u201cbefore they lure in more unsuspecting victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver time, people began to see what I hoped we could show \u2014 that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are,\u201d Anderson wrote."

      "He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "Bessent was one of several people whom Trump considered for the role. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee. He also mulled over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president\u2019s fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president\u2019s National Economic Council.",

      "\u201cProductive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\u201d Bessent plans to say in his testimony.",
      "Senators are expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions on Friday, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit."

      "It turns out that $1.8 billion wasn\u2019t just sitting in a bank account in South Carolina waiting to be spent",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- It turns out that $1.8 billion in South Carolina state funds weren't just sitting in a bank account waiting to be spent. Instead, it was an accounting error compounded over years instead of being reconciled, an independent forensic audit determined.",
      "The announcement Wednesday dashed ideas like returning the money to taxpayers or using the windfall on roads. But it also led to more questions: why wasn't the error reported when it was first discovered back around 2018, and should the elected state treasurer, Curtis Loftis, step down or be impeached.",
      "\"In the private sector, if anybody had made a blunder of $1.8 billion -- whether it was an error, negligence, misfeasance, malfeasance, fraud or a cover-up, they would lose their job,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Larry Grooms, who leads a committee investigating the accounting problems.",
      "The private audit, which cost millions of dollars, is the most comprehensive look so far into the South Carolina Treasurer and Comptroller General's Office. Those agencies are typically led by elected officials and are in charge of making sure that government accounts stay balanced.",
      "The audit isn't the final word on the matter. Investigators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, are trying to determine if it was just a series of mistakes or whether state employees figured out what was going on and tried to cover it up, Grooms said.",
      "Depending on how serious the allegations are, the state could see its rates to borrow money rise, pay fines or face other punishment.",
      "In a separate case, the elected Republican comptroller general \u2014 the state\u2019s top accountant \u2014 resigned in 2023 after his agency started double-posting the amount the state had sent to colleges and universities for a decade, leading to a different $3.5 billion error that also was all on paper.",
      "While Richard Eckstrom stepped aside in that case, Loftis has defended himself and his office.",
      "The problems with the $1.8 billion error started as the state changed computer systems in the 2010s. Grooms said the initial mistake happened when Loftis, whose job is to write checks for the state, shifted accounts from the old system to the new one.",
      "Loftis testified under oath before senators last year that he invested the money in the mystery $1.8 billion account and made nearly $200 million in interest for the state, which Grooms said seems impossible since there was no money there. The senator said Loftis also appears to have lied under oath when he said their was no federal investigation into his office.",
      "Loftis issued a statement Wednesday thanking the audit firm Alix Partners for its work. He did not address the statements from Grooms.",
      "\u201cThe citizens of South Carolina can be confident that their money is safe,\u201d Loftis said. \"We, along with our state partners, look forward to reviewing the report in its entirety.\u201d",
      "Gov. Henry McMaster said he has confidence in everyone going forward to handle the state's accounts and doesn't think there was any intention to deceive anyone.",
      "\u201cIt was an accounting error with no criminal conduct, no wrongful intent, no intent to make the error \u2014 errors sometimes happen and unfortunately, that was a big one,\u201d McMaster told reporters.",
      "Among other recommendations, the audit said South Carolina should hire a third-party auditor to look over the shoulders of the Treasurer and Comptroller General offices to make sure the state's accounting books are properly kept.",
      "The state has its own auditor, but that person is hired by a five-person board that includes both the treasurer and comptroller general. Lawmakers are likely to look into why that person didn't raise the alarm about the accounting problems sooner, Grooms said.",
      "Meetings have already been scheduled with a House subcommittee, and the Senate Finance Committee will likely call Loftis to testify by the end of the month, Grooms said.",
      "South Carolina has had a long history of accounting issues.",
      "The Treasurer\u2019s Office was created when the state\u2019s first constitution was written in 1776. Back then, the General Assembly selected the treasurer. But by the early 1800s, the state\u2019s finances were in \u201ca state of bewildering confusion\u201d and no one could \u201ctell the amounts of debts or of the credit of the State,\u201d according to History of South Carolina, a book edited in 1920 by Yates Snowden and Howard Cutler.",
      "The first comptroller general determined the state was owed about $750,000 in debts, which would be worth about $20 million today."

      "The lead budget writing committee to the Democratic-led Legislature proposed a $577 million increase to $10.8 billion for the fiscal year running from July 2025 to June 2026. A windfall in government income from petroleum production is slowing down though far from over in New Mexico, the nation\u2019s No. 2 oil-producing state.",

Michelle Lujan Grisham has set crime and homelessness as a central focus for of the 60-day legislative session that begins Tuesday.",

      "Distributions from New Mexico's early childhood education trust \u2014 an endowment built on a windfall in state income from oil production \u2014 would increase by $290 million, or nearly 9%, to $854 million to expand childcare and related medical assistance.",

      "The Legislature's budget recommendation includes an average 4% pay increase for public employees across state government, public schools and colleges.",
      "The budget proposals do not outline possible tax cuts or incentives. Republicans in the state House minority are advocating to eliminate personal income taxes that peak at 5.9% for top earners."

      "\u201cAirlines have a legal obligation to ensure that their flight schedules provide travelers with realistic departure and arrival times,\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action sends a message to all airlines that the Department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.\u201d",
      "The Transportation Department said its investigation found that Dallas-based Southwest operated two chronically delayed flights \u2013 one between Chicago Midway International Airport and Oakland, California, and another between Baltimore, Maryland and Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "Both flights were chronically delayed for five straight months and together resulted in 180 flight disruptions for passengers between April and August 2022, the agency said.",
      "The department fined Frontier Airlines $650,000 in civil penalties with $325,000 to be paid to the U.S. Treasury and the remaining $325,000 to be suspended if the carrier does not operate any chronically delayed flights in the next three years.",
      "The announcement comes less than two weeks after the Transportation Department fined JetBlue $2 million for chronic delays, the first time it imposed a penalty for lateness on specific routes. The agency cited JetBlue's chronic delays on \u201cunrealistic scheduling.\u201d JetBlue then said the government, which operates the air traffic control system, shares the blame for late flights.",
      "Aviation-data provider Cirium said in a report released this month that Southwest ranked fifth among the 10 North American airlines it evaluated for their on-time performance, with 77.8% of arrivals and a little under 77% of departures last year taking place in a timely way. By comparison, top-ranked Delta Air Lines scored 83.5% for arrivals and 83.7% for departures.",
      "Last year, federal regulators increased their scrutiny of Southwest Airlines after a series of incidents, including flying at very low altitudes while still miles away from an airport. The Federal Aviation Administration said in July it wanted to ensure the carrier was complying with federal safety regulations. The FAA declined to provide details, but noted that it continually adjusts oversight of airlines based on risk.",

      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the Office of Defects Investigation opened a preliminary evaluation in October 2023 to determine whether vehicles equipped with an Automated Driving System made and operated by Cruise LLC were using appropriate caution around pedestrians in the roadway after receiving two reports of crashes involving pedestrians. The office also identified two public reports of Cruise ADS-equipped vehicles encroaching on pedestrians in crosswalks.",

The crash involved one of its Cruise robotaxis dragging a pedestrian to the side of a San Francisco street. The crash prompted Cruise to suspend driverless operations nationwide after California regulators found that its cars posed a danger to public safety. The state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the license for Cruise, which was transporting passengers without human drivers throughout San Francisco.",
      "The agency said Tuesday that it analyzed 2,759 reports identified by Cruise that involved collisions, including 1,113 that involved a \u201cpedestrian conflict.\u201d Five of those incidents involved a collision between a Cruise and a pedestrian, with three injuries in total.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

The annual showcase includes advanced automotive tech in an industry striving to reduce pollution and increase occupant safety while also providing greater convenience and entertainment for road warriors. These are the most impressive innovations we saw at this year\u2019s event.",
      "What kind of screens and technology can you expect to see in new vehicles in the coming years? BMW\u2019s all-new in-cabin digital interface, dubbed Panoramic iDrive, gives us a compelling preview.",
      "Panoramic iDrive has a digital display at the base of the windshield spanning the entire dashboard. This display is called Panoramic Vision, and it projects everything from speed to EV range to navigation guidance, along with climate and audio info. This display pairs with an easy-to-reach central touchscreen and advanced head-up display that can project 3D-like information on the windshield for the driver. BMW also showcased a new squared-off steering wheel with illuminated buttons that the company says are very easy to use.",

The Honda 0 SUV and 0 Saloon are based on two wild-looking concept cars shown at last year\u2019s CES, yet these production-ready models haven\u2019t lost any of their aggressive style and will definitely turn heads when they arrive in 2026.",
      "Both will be built in Ohio and will be capable of Level 3 automated driving functionality, meaning drivers will be allowed to drive hands-free and take their eyes off the road for short periods of time when specific environmental conditions are met. Honda says these 0 models will also use a new technology interface, called Asimo, that will provide a high degree of personalization to customize the driving experience for each user.",
      "The launch of the 0 SUV and 0 Saloon will coincide with Honda\u2019s effort to improve charging access to drivers through a joint effort with seven other automakers. The goal is to have 30,000 high-speed charging stations built in North America by 2030. These stations will have plugs with the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard, or NACS, which most automakers have been switching to.",

      "But what if you could combine the power of satellite, cellular and Wi-Fi networks into a single pipeline of internet service? And what if that pipeline could constantly evaluate and optimize the data stream as you travel between signal sources? That\u2019s exactly what Stellar, a new company from France, is offering. The company is working with automakers to optimize mobile service by using hardware already built into today\u2019s cars. The end goal is to have improved, more consistent high-speed internet access in your vehicle, whether you\u2019re going through a city tunnel or driving across the open plains.",
      "Toyota\u2019s vision for the future of mobility goes beyond EVs and self-driving cars. The company is engineering a complete city environment in Japan where everything from building construction to food supply to education and transportation are coordinated for maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact. The areas of focus include personal transportation, and the company\u2019s massive site, called Woven City, will serve as a test course for automated tech development.",
      "Woven City will scale from an initial 50,000 square miles up to 700,000 square miles as construction continues. By the fall of 2025, it will provide housing for about 360 Toyota staff and family members and eventually expand to 2,000-plus residents, including Woven City partner companies involved in construction, food and drink, education and even rocket production.",
      "While it\u2019s hard to predict what will come out of Toyota\u2019s Woven City that will actually end up in production vehicles, it\u2019s fair to say that Toyota will have a head start on how to leverage various new technologies best.",
      "Full self-driving cars have yet to appear, but automakers are chipping away at this elusive tech while making clear progress in advanced user interfaces, electric vehicle design, and even comprehensive city planning. While the last few years have seen moderate progress in these areas, it feels like we\u2019re on the cusp of multiple breakthroughs in the automotive space.",

      "\u201cThe future of energy transition and digitization will thus depend on our ability to strike a balance between sustainability and innovation,\u201d she said, adding that nuclear fusion could be another way to produce clean and safe energy.

      "The German economy shrank for the second straight year in 2024 as worried consumers held back on spending and Chinese competition ate into the country\u2019s traditional exports of cars and industrial machinery",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's economy shrank for the second straight year in 2024 as worried consumers held back on spending and Chinese competition ate into the country's traditional exports of cars and industrial machinery.",
      "The year's weak performance underlines Germany's status as Europe's worst performing major economy and shows the country as having no meaningful growth in the past four years as it has struggled to deal with major shifts in the global economy.",
      "Gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% last year, following a 0.3% decline in 2023, according to preliminary official figures released Wednesday, weeks before an election in which the economy is the top issue.",
      "The economy is now only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "German business has been battered by external shocks and homegrown problems, unleashing an angst-ridden national debate over how to remedy the situation. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition government collapsed in November when Scholz fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize the economy. That paved the way for an early election on Feb. 23.",
      "Contenders to lead the next government have made contrasting proposals on how to inject new vigor into the economy.",
      "Ruth Brand, the head of the statistics office, ticked off the list of short- and long-term challenges: higher energy prices after the loss of cheap natural gas from Russia; high interest rates from the European Central Bank that deter investment in new machinery and vehicles; and consumers worried about the future who are saving their wages instead of spending them.",
      "Spending on hotels and restaurants sagged by 4.4% and outlays for clothing and shoes fell by 2.8% despite rising disposable income.",
      "On top of that comes increasing competition for export markets from China in traditional areas of German strength such as cars, industrial machinery and chemicals.",
      "Other, more chronic issues include excessive bureaucracy and a shortage of skilled labor.",
      "\u201cGerman exports saw themselves exposed to stronger international competition, not least from the People's Republic of China,\u201d Brand said. \u201cGerman exports shrank although world trade increased in 2024.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe German economy is mired in stagnation,\u201d said Nils Jannsen of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. And prospects for growth in the coming year are \u201cgloomy,\u201d he said, with the \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over the export-oriented economy from possible new U.S. trade measures such as higher tariffs on imported goods from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office in less than a week.",
      "Despite the weak growth figures, the jobs market remains strong and disposable income is rising along with pay raises from new wage agreements aimed at making up for inflation.",
      "But a willingness to spend is being held back by worries fed by a range of factors, including a drumbeat of job cut announcements at major companies including Volkswagen, steelmaker and industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp and auto technology supplier Bosch, and by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Brand said that the economy is believed to have shrunk by 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three-month period. That, however, is a rough initial estimate because hard economic data for December haven't yet been released."

      "The only thing Ravens coach John Harbaugh figures is missing in preparation for Baltimore's divisional round playoff showdown in Buffalo is having the deep and resonant voice of late NFL Films broadcaster John Facenda serve as narrator",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Baltimore coach John Harbaugh has enjoyed the fortune of competing on the NFL\u2019s biggest stages to appreciate the setting and magnitude of what\u2019s on the line for the Ravens and Bills in Buffalo on Sunday.",
      "There's the quarterback matchup pitting arguably the NFL\u2019s two leading MVP candidates in Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen.",
      "These are two division champions with a combined 27 wins two steps from a Super Bowl berth.",
      "Even the forecast of frigid conditions \u2014 temperatures are expected to dip below 10 Fahrenheit (minus-12 Celsius) \u2014 enters the equation as the third-seeded Ravens (13-5) travel to face the Bills (14-4) in the divisional playoff round.",
      "\u201cI can just kind of picture John Facenda coming down from the heavens and narrating the preview to the game,\u201d Harbaugh said, referring to the late NFL Films narrator whose deep, resonant voice brought gravitas to the league\u2019s classic showdowns. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be a part of a game like this.\u201d",
      "The quarterback matchup alone is worthy of the weeklong hype and prime-time setting involving two dual threats, both selected in the first round of the 2018 draft, and the focus of a high-pitched debate over who is more valuable to their respective team.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why you play this game to be in moments like these,\u201d said Allen, before playing down the individual aspect of facing Jackson. \u201cIn the history of football, I\u2019ve never really played against another quarterback.\u201d",
      "The 28-year-old Allen topped 40 combined touchdowns for a fifth consecutive year while overseeing an offense that was the NFL\u2019s first to score 30 touchdowns both passing and rushing.",
      "The 28-year-old Jackson, similarly, refused to make it personal.",
      "\u201cExcuse me for everybody watching, but I really don\u2019t care who\u2019s watching,\u201d Jackson said of facing Allen. \u201cWe really don\u2019t care how people feel about it. We\u2019re trying to go in there and just win.\u201d",
      "Jackson combined for a career-best 45 touchdowns, led the league in numerous passing categories while running an offense that was the NFL\u2019s first to top 4,000 yards passing and 3,000 yards rushing.",
      "What still sticks with Jackson is how his last visit to Buffalo ended in a 17-3 loss in the 2020 divisional round, with Taron Johnson sealing the win with a 101-yard interception return.",
      "\u201cHell, yes,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that.\u201d",
      "In Buffalo, there\u2019s an underlying theme of redemption, too, after the Ravens trampled the Bills in a 35-10 win in Week 4.",
      "The Bills are challenged in finding a way to slow Derrick Henry, who had a season-best 199 yards rushing against them in September, including an 87-yard touchdown run on the Ravens first offensive snap.",
      "\"I think we\u2019re a lot better,\u201d said Johnson, one of three Bills defensive starters who are set to play after being sidelined against Baltimore in September. \u201cThis it\u2019s a new day. Things are just going to be different. That\u2019s just the way they are.\u201d",
      "The Ravens' test is understanding how Buffalo's offense has adapted while gaining a more balanced identity.",
      "Running back James Cook matched Henry with 16 TD runs this season \u2014 13 of them after Week 5. Buffalo also features the addition of receiver Amari Cooper, who was acquired in a trade in mid-October and provides another weapon to a passing attack that had 13 players with a touchdown catch.",
      "\u201cWe are obviously two very different teams than we were whenever that game was,\u201d Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton said. \u201cThe biggest thing we take away from that is that it can be done, we just have to replicate that success. But I know Buffalo has a sour taste in their mouth about that game.\u201d",
      "Sour, indeed.",
      "Defensive tackle DaQuan Jones immediately turned his attention to facing Baltimore after Buffalo\u2019s 31-7 wild-card win over Denver on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bloodbath,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mindset thing. At the end of the day, you just have to have the right mindset to go into any game to be physical in order to dominate.\u201d",
      "The Ravens continue to raise the bar for their running game, which set a regular-season record with 5.76 yards per attempt. The previous mark lasted six decades after the 1963 Browns averaged 5.74.",
      "In eight career playoff games, Henry has surpassed 150 yards rushing four times. That\u2019s tied with Hall of Famer Terrell Davis for the most in NFL postseason history.",
      "These are two teams who have spent the previous four years playing second fiddle in the AFC to the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals.",
      "In that time, Buffalo has been eliminated by Kansas City three times and Cincinnati once. The Ravens' last two playoff losses came in the 2022 wild-card round against Cincinnati, and last year's conference championship game to Kansas City.",
      "Bills edge rusher Von Miller was inspired by linebacker Terrel Bernard citing Greek philosopher Heraclitus in discussing how the past doesn\u2019t repeat itself because the world is ever-changing.",
      "\u201cHe was saying that the man gets in the river once and the next time he gets in the river, it\u2019s not the same man, and it\u2019s not the same river. The past is the past,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe have a huge opportunity in front of us to go out there and achieve all of our dreams.\u201d",
      "Both teams' kickers experienced inconsistencies this season.",
      "In his 13th season, Baltimore's Justin Tucker was good on a career-worst 73.3% of his field-goal attempts while going 22 of 30, including 6 of 11 from 50 yards or longer. He also missed two extra-point attempts.",
      "Buffalo's Tyler Bass closed his fifth season going 24 of 29 in field-goal attempts for a second straight year, while missing a career-worst five extra-point tries.",

      "After all, he had piled up 290 yards receiving in two postseason wins and was looking like the star to stop for the rest of the College Football Playoff field. Instead, he was double-teamed by the Longhorns and limited to a single catch for three yards as Ohio State advanced to Monday's national championship game against Notre Dame with a 28-14 victory.",
      "The 6-foot-3 freshman is a big reason the Buckeyes are here. It may have been hard for many younger players to stay engaged in a game where his impact was limited. But Smith, 19, knew Texas\u2019 focus on his play would help the rest of the offense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating but it\u2019s part of being a teammate,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou got to open things up.\u201d",
      "Smith, the No. 1-ranked player in the 2024 recruiting class, amassed 1,227 yards and 14 touchdowns in his first season, breaking Cris Carter\u2019s freshman school records for receiving yards, receptions and touchdowns as he was voted a second-team AP All-American.",
      "The blanket coverage of Smith by Texas is a big reason why wide receiver Carnell Tate finished with a career-high seven catches for a team-high 87 yards, and Emeka Egbuka hauled in five for 51 yards.",
      "\u201cI know they will always do their part no matter if I\u2019m double-teamed or not I know they\u2019re always gonna be open and get the job done,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Notre Dame cornerback Leonard Moore and the Fighting Irish defense is preparing for Smith. Moore said he must trust his technique and training to compete with Smith.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s definitely an elite receiver, of course,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe\u2019s big, he\u2019s physical, he\u2019s good at attacking the ball in the air. So we just got to be as good and better at attacking the ball this week, so be ready to challenge him.\u201d",
      "Offensive coordinator Chip Kelly said Ohio State\u2019s win against Texas reflects the team\u2019s gameplan \u2014 having multiple players who can perform any night.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of what we have here is we have more than one weapon,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe quarterback has to make really good decisions on what they\u2019re trying to take away and then adjust accordingly and I think Will (Howard) did a really good job of that.\u201d",
      "Coaches and players alike know Smith\u2019s value on the field cannot be measured. Smith is also ensuring himself and his future by purchasing permanent total disability insurance, according to CBS Sports. Smith\u2019s premiums, according to the report, cost between $7,500 and $8,000 per million of coverage, protecting himself against a career-ending injury until Aug. 1, 2027, or when he signs an NFL contract.",
      "Smith, who is from Miami Gardens, Florida, said playing in a national championship game is something that has been on his mind since he was a child.",

      "Aaron Rodgers\u2019 playing future remains undecided with the New York Jets quarterback focused on the lingering wildfires near his home in Southern California",
      "Aaron Rodgers' playing future remains undecided, with the New York Jets quarterback focused on the lingering wildfires near his home in Southern California.",
      "Rodgers said during an appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d on Thursday that his house in the Malibu area is OK other than having dealt with a lack of power for several days. But he said many friends, including actor Miles Teller, have lost property during one of the most destructive natural disasters in the region.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with trying to protect my house out here,\" Rodgers said. \"My home is fine. I\u2019m not in the areas that have been affected, but it\u2019s been a weird time for so many that live down here. Friends of mine have lost houses. A number of friends in Palisades have lost their homes, a number of friends in Pasadena were affected, friends around Runyon Canyon.",
      "\u201cIt's been a tough time, for sure.\u201d",
      "The 41-year-old Rodgers completed his 20th NFL season in the Jets' win over Miami on Jan. 5. He had exit meetings the next day with owner Woody Johnson, vice chairman Christopher Johnson, team president Hymie Elhai and interim coach Jeff Ulbrich and then flew home Tuesday to Southern California, where \u201cthe whole sky was dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI got to the house and the wind's going absolutely nuts,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe gate was flying off the handles, and no power.\u201d",
      "Rodgers said before leaving, he had \u201ca lot of nice conversations\u201d with the team, which is currently interviewing candidates for its general manager and head coach vacancies. Rodgers has said he would consider after the season if he wants to continue playing and would also have to see if the Jets' new regime wants him to be part of the team moving forward if he does intend to return for a 21st season.",
      "Rodgers said he has been in \u201climited communication\u201d with the Jets' brass because of the wildfires, but reiterated he isn't close to making a decision on his playing future.",
      "\u201cI told them I\u2019m going to take some time,\u201d he said. \"They haven\u2019t even made a decision on a GM or a coach yet. Once that happens, then that\u2019ll take us to the next step, which will be a conversation, I\u2019m assuming with whoever that individual is. But this is a time when I\u2019m taking time for my body and my mind to clear things.",
      "\u201cObviously it\u2019s different because all that\u2019s going on in LA. And again, there\u2019s been incredible, incredible work done by all the firefighters out here. Things are actually looking up, which is great.\u201d",
      "Firefighters are still battling the two largest fires, which have killed 25 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures.",
      "\u201cA lot of the attention has gone to so many celebrities who lost their homes,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThere's some affluent areas in both Palisades and Malibu that got affected. But there's a lot of other people, just your great average Southern California folks who lost everything as well. And it's going to be tough to rebuild.\u201d",
      "The four-time MVP, who's the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season, has one year of non-guaranteed money left on his contract with the Jets. But he would be due a $35 million option bonus before the regular season begins and count $23.5 million against the salary cap.",
      "If Rodgers is cut or retires, the Jets could absorb a $49 million dead money charge next year unless they designate him a post-June 1 cut and can spread out that charge over two years.",
      "\u201cI think everybody understands that it\u2019s going to come down to the GM and coach and myself,\u201d Rodgers said, \u201cand whether we all want to do the dance together or if it\u2019s not in the cards.\u201d",
      "He also said the situation in Southern California won't affect his decision on whether he wants to continue playing.",
      "\u201cListen, I\u2019ve sat in a hole in the ground in Nowheresville, Oregon, and I\u2019ve sat in numerous ayahuasca ceremony circles,\u201d Rodgers said with a smile, referring to some of his activities in previous offseasons. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve done a lot of contemplating in my time and I've gotten some good perspective adjustments over the years.",
      "\"This is nothing that changes my perspective other than it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 16:02:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Washington Commanders kicker Zane Gonzalez has lived with obsessive-compulsive disorder his entire life",
    "story": [
      "Washington Commanders kicker Zane Gonzalez has lived with obsessive-compulsive disorder his entire life",
      "ASHBURN, Va. -- A national television audience watched Zane Gonzalez adjust his socks on the sideline and fix his hair multiple times before putting his helmet on and taking the field to kick the winning field goal in an NFL playoff game Sunday night.",
      "Those watching did not see Gonzalez as a kid writing and rewriting papers and taking walks outside with his father or playing soccer to get his mind off homework he could not finish. Only his wife saw him set and reset his alarm clock about 100 times Wednesday night to make sure it was right.",
      "All of it stems from the obsessive-compulsive disorder Gonzalez has lived with his entire life, from childhood to now being a kicker for the Washington Commanders. Making the field goal to deliver the franchise's first postseason victory in nearly two decades has allowed Gonzalez to share his story, hear from others, correct any misconceptions and shed some light on what it is like to play professional football with OCD.",
      "\u201cAnybody that has OCD understands that mental battle\u2019s not easy,\u201d Gonzalez said after practice Thursday. \"You truly think it\u2019s the end of the world or whatever that situation is that you\u2019re going through that you think the worst possible situation can come of it. And even if it\u2019s the most unrealistic thing ever, that\u2019s just kind of the way you think about it sometimes.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez, who banked the kick off the right upright and through as time expired to beat Tampa Bay and send the Commanders to the next round at Detroit, feels he has gotten better at handling the uncontrollable, recurring thoughts and fears that come with the anxiety disorder. At 29, he is more confident and has been able to shrug off some of the social media attention that followed his viral moment.",
      "\u201cAs a kid you\u2019re more adamant about trying to hide it and trying not to show people,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cYou\u2019re just like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want people to think whatever, this or that.\u2019 I mean, you saw the reaction. People were always like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s nervous.\u2019 It\u2019s like, OK, it\u2019s not nervous. It\u2019s just kind of a tick-type deal. ... Being a professional athlete it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m in the big moment, big stage, do what you do, make the kick.'\u201d",
      "After he made the kick, Gonzalez's wife, Lizzy, posted a TikTok responding to people making fun of her husband's OCD. It came up on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show,\u201d with the retired punter-turned-TV star talking about how much of the position was mental and how kickers develop routines to get in the right frame of mind.",
      "Gonzalez's pre-kick mannerisms are nothing new, and he said his wife and teammates have seen it plenty over the years at practices and in games.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen the hair-fixing and adjusting his shoe \u2014 I never thought anything of it,\u201d long snapper Tyler Ott said. \"But when he gets a minute on screen of leading up to the kick to send us to the first playoff win in 18, 19 years, it got some more attention.\u201d",
      "In recent days, Gonzalez, Ott and punter/holder Tress Way have made light of the hair-fixing, laughing about it after receiving an award in a team meeting and mimicking it during practice. Coach Dan Quinn knew about Gonzalez's OCD and said he was glad at this opportunity to make it a subject of proper discussion.",
      "\u201cIf that is a chance for him to assist one other person, I think that takes just a lot of courage and tells you a lot about who he is, not just as a ballplayer but as a man,\u201d Quinn said.",
      "Way, Washington's longest-tenured player who finally got to celebrate his first playoff win, has enjoyed every bit of teaming with Gonzalez, who he called \u201cabout as low maintenance as they come.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun to play with a guy like that and to be working with a guy like that,\u201d Way said. \u201cHe just trusts Tyler and I to get everything ready, and he has just a great attitude and a great mentality for it.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez is the fourth different kicker the Commanders have had this season and seventh since the spring. Now on his fourth organization after stints with Arizona, Cleveland and Carolina, he made 5 of 7 field-goal attempts and was 19 of 19 on extra points during the regular season before being perfect in the wild-card round to beat the Buccaneers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been great in terms of we\u2019ve had a lot of turnover at that position,\" special teams coordinator Larry Izzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely stabilized the position, and he\u2019s come in and done his job. We\u2019re really happy with him.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez, who has learned some tricks to handle his OCD and spoken to therapists about it, is happy to get this chance to explain what he can about how he's thinking and have whatever positive impact he can off the field, as well as on it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of people that walk through life dealing with struggles on a day-to-day (basis), and a lot of it\u2019s at home that people don\u2019t see, Gonzalez said. \"It\u2019s been pretty neat to see the community come together and just kind of helping you out a little bit.\u201d",

      "The athletic director at a mid-sized school that\u2019s making a splash this season has a modest proposal that might offer one way to tame what many say is a transfer-portal system run amok in college sports",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The athletic director at a mid-sized school that's making a splash this season has a modest proposal for taming what many say is a transfer-portal system run amok in college sports.",
      "Sean Frazier, the AD at Northern Illinois \u2014 remember, the team that beat national finalist Notre Dame earlier this season \u2014 is talking about a \u201ctalent acquisition fee.\"",
      "When schools sign players from other teams, they would pay those teams a fee in exchange for the player. It's not that different from the way transactions go down with what are known as \u201ctransfer fees\u201d in European soccer.",
      "It's an idea that Frazier, admittedly, is still sketching out on cocktail napkins. But he thinks it might help the small guys sustain their programs while adding transparency to deals involving some of the 11,000-plus football players across all divisions who enter the portal \u2014 the terms of some of those life-changing transactions themselves pecked out on cell phones in the middle of the night.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the kid deserves the compensation and support,\u201d Frazier said in an interview with The Associated Press at the NCAA convention this week. \u201cBut the institution, to keep the cycle going, they deserve something as well. We're not in the situation to continue to do that if we keep losing our best and brightest.\u201d",
      "Buoyed by that win over Notre Dame, and a steady string of success over the years, Frazier's school recently announced it was moving its football program from the Mid-American into the Mountain West Conference starting in 2026.",
      "The Mountain West, with champion Boise State in the College Football Playoff this season, is arguably the most formidable of the so-called Group of Five conferences. There are also 129 schools in the FCS \u2014 the Football Championship Subdivision that is the latest iteration of what used to be called Division I-AA.",
      "With the House Settlement set to reshape college sports, allowing institutions to pay players directly while also reshaping roster sizes across all sports, smaller schools like NIU have decisions to make. Namely, will they opt into the revenue-sharing agreements that allow the schools to directly pay the players for their name, image, likeness deals? Or will they stick with the model of having third-party collectives broker those deals?",
      "The schools have until March 1 to decide. Neither choice avoids the stark realities of the new college football: It's more expensive than it used to be, and big schools will always have the resources to draw in promising players who honed their skills at small schools.",
      "Frazier used the example of 285-pound defensive tackle Skyler Gill-Howard, who came to NIU as a walk-on, got better each year, had five sacks for the Huskies this season, then entered the transfer portal and will play his last year of eligibility at Texas Tech.",
      "\u201cHe did a wonderful job. Our coaching staff did a great job developing him,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThe heartache of it is, he's gone. From the G5 perspective, we're fine with the developmental side of things. There's a certain level of respect there. But this could help institutions like us, where there's a flat fee, or dollar amount, that's a show of appreciation for the development of the game.\u201d",
      "Any plan like this would face roadblocks aplenty. First off, even though things have moved more quickly in recent years, college sports is traditionally glacial in making big changes.",
      "Secondly, as the recent takedowns of the NCAA in court that have led to today's changes have reiterated, the U.S. court system generally doesn't like things that restrict players' ability to make money.",
      "It happened to the NFL, too. In the 1970s, a judge declared illegal \u201cThe Rozelle Rule,\u201d a rule named after the late commissioner, Pete Rozelle. The rule is similar to Frazier's idea in that it allowed the league to award draft picks (and sometimes players) from teams that signed players with expired contracts to the teams those players left.",
      "In soccer, transfer fees have been the norm in Europe \u2014 teams essentially pay other teams for players instead of trading for them. It's an estimated $10 billion market, though a recent court ruling there could lead to anything from tweaks to a full-scale overhaul of that system.",
      "\u201cI'd see very little chance for something like that to happen,\" Gabe Feldman, a sports law expert at Tulane, said of Frazier's fee idea. \"There are lots of ideas out there, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll go into effect.\u201d",
      "Though the House Settlement brings college sports closer to a solution on how to pay players, the transfer portal remains a moving target.",
      "The leadup to this year's national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame brought with it stories of massive movement of players, including from the 12 teams that made the College Football Playoff.",
      "Among this season's biggest headline grabbers were the early season departure from UNLV of quarterback Matthew Sluka, who said promises to pay him $100,000 were not kept. Last year, former Florida QB signee Jaden Rashada sued Gators coach Billy Napier over an unpaid $13 million NIL deal. Rashada now plays at Georgia.",
      "More common are accusations of tampering that leads to programs standing by helplessly as players leave without much, if any, warning.",
      "\u201cI can't believe we live in a world where people are making decisions and issuing offers in text messages,\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker said. \u201cThe number of kids who have told me terrible stories about misrepresentation \u2014 there's no process, accountability, no transparency.\"",
      "Frazier, always in search of resources to recruit, develop and, now more frequently, replace players, doesn't necessarily see his \u201ctalent acquisition\u201d fee as a cure-all. But maybe, he says, it's a start.",
      "He points to the NFL, NBA and other pro leagues that have collective bargaining and drafts that set the framework for their sports.",
      "\u201cWe don't have that,\" he said. \"This is one of the guardrails that could get us to the point of acknowledging that, yes, you still can buy your team, but it shouldn't be the wild, wild west.\u201d",

      "___",
      "\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we mourn the passing of Bob. To many, he was an announcer and entertainer whose humor and voice transcended the game, but to us he was so much more. Bob faced a private battle with small cell lung cancer since early 2023, which he met with the same strength and resilience that defined him. Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter. He brought joy to countless listeners through his wit, charisma, and love for baseball, Milwaukee, and all of Wisconsin, creating a legacy that will forever be cherished. While his contributions to the game are noteworthy, it is his kindness, humility, and love for family and friends that we will hold closest to our hearts.

Bob loved people; his presence warmed every room and he had a way of welcoming all of us into his world as if we were lifelong friends. Saying goodbye to Bob shakes us all. He was so much more than a Milwaukee Brewers icon. He was a national treasure. Bob entertained us with his words and storytelling, so it is no surprise that his passing now leaves us at a loss for our own words There is no describing the impact Ueck had on so many, and no words for how much he was loved.

Bob had the easiest way of making others feel at ease, share a laugh and always left people feeling a little better. Nobody was his equal. I am so grateful that Bob\u2019s friendship was a constant presence throughout most of my life. For over fifty years, rarely did a day pass where we missed a conversation, a sharing of stories, and countless laughs. That cannot be replaced and is a giant loss, but I am lucky to have experienced that kind of enduring friendship. Sue and I are thinking of Judy, Bob\u2019s children Sue Ann and Bob Jr., and all of Bob\u2019s family during what is a difficult time for all of us.\u201d \u2014 MLB Commissioner Emeritus and former Brewers owner Bud Selig",

      "\u201cWhile this onetime backup catcher was known for his self-deprecating style, Bob Uecker was one of the game\u2019s most beloved figures throughout his 70-year career in baseball. In his six years in his hometown of Milwaukee as well as St. Louis, Philadelphia and Atlanta, Bob made lifelong friendships with many Hall of Famers and other stars of the \u201960s, and he was a member of the 1964 World Series Champion Cardinals. Near the beginning of his remarkable 54-year run in the Brewers\u2019 radio booth, Bob\u2019s trademark wit became a staple of television and movies. Even with his considerable success in Hollywood, Bob remained fiercely loyal to baseball and to Milwaukee. He loved the game and used his platform to help numerous charitable causes in his hometown and beyond.",

We are grateful for this baseball life like no other, and we will never forget him.

I always cherished our time together and just being able to listen to you talk about your life and all you\u2019d seen. I remember you saying that no matter how much time you have it still never feels like enough and that seems pretty true today.

Bob was the glue that held us together and kept us grounded. He never took anything too seriously, and his #1 goal was always to make us laugh.\u201d \u2014 Tracy (Wells) Tofte, who appeared alongside Uecker on the 1980s sitcom \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d",

      "The Indiana Fever are building a new practice facility set to open before the 2027 WNBA season, the franchise announced Thursday",
      "The Indiana Fever have had a revival with the additions of Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston over the last two seasons.",
      "Now the franchise, which made the playoffs last season for the first time since 2016, is building a new practice facility that's set to open before the 2027 WNBA season, the Fever announced Thursday.",
      "The $78 million performance center will be in downtown Indianapolis and connect to Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where the Fever play, via a skybridge.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to partner with Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett to identify the perfect location for the Indiana Fever Sports Performance Center,\u201d Pacers Sports and Entertainment owner Herb Simon said. \u201cThe city of Indianapolis continues to be a tremendous partner as we elevate our team, players and community.\u201d",
      "The Fever have had their own practice court and training area in Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where the Indiana Pacers also play. It was renovated in 2020.",
      "The new facility will have best-in-class amenities, including two regulation-sized courts with natural light, premier strength and conditioning equipment, yoga and Pilates area, hydration station and full-service kitchen. To help players recover and recharge, the facility will offer a spa-like retreat with massage, infrared light therapy, sauna, steam, heat studios, float tank and multiple hydrotherapy pools.",
      "\u201cIt's exciting. I was just saying how it\u2019s just a great opportunity,\u201d Boston said. \u201cYou look at our owners and how much they pour into us, it\u2019s super exciting to really have our own facility.\u201d",

Where can I go and get recovery? Where can I go and get a massage? It's going to be right there for us and we'll be the most recovered and be the most prepared for our games.

      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \u201cMr. Baseball\u201d and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died. He was 90.",
      "The team announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker\u2019s family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\u201cEven in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\u201d the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson\u2019s late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He\u2019d last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCareer highlights? I had two,\u201d he often joked. \u201cI got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\u201d",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker\u2019s initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers\u2019 most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker\u2019s broadcasts.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no single person in this franchise\u2019s history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\u201d said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers\u2019 broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\u201cTo be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people\u2019s families,\u201d Uecker once said. \u201cI know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That\u2019s part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\u201d",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\u201cI still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014 still think I should have gone in as a player,\u201d he quipped.",
      "\u201cUeck\u201d got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt\u2019s nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt\u2019s attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson\u2019s favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \u201cMr. Baseball.\u201d And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker\u2019s comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the \u201990s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom, \u201cMr. Belvedere.\u201d",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m part of American folklore, I guess,\u201d Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\u201d",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014 \u201cJuuuust a bit outside!\u201d \u2014 in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker\u2019s acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren\u2019t, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\u201d Uecker said. \u201cI think people see \u2018Major League\u2019 and they think Harry Doyle and figure that\u2019s what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we\u2019ve got a good game going, I don\u2019t mess around.\u201d",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\u201cYou talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\u201d Selig said. \u201cAbove all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That\u2019s what he did. He\u2019s everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\u201d",
      "Uecker\u2019s own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\u201cI signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn\u2019t have that kind of dough,\u201d he said \u201cBut he eventually scraped it up.\u201d",
      "Another classic: \u201cWhen I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team\u2019s dugout and they were already in street clothes.\u201d",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers\u2019 new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \u201cUecker Seats\u201d high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker\u2019s honor. There\u2019s a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \u201cI must be in the front row!\u201d while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Danielle Collins has gotten into a back-and-forth with a booing crowd at the Australian Open after eliminating a local player",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Danielle Collins got into a back-and-forth with a booing crowd at the Australian Open after eliminating a local player on Thursday night, blowing kisses to the spectators and repeating the phrase, \u201cHow about that?!\u201d",
      "The 10th-seeded Collins, an American who was the runner-up to Australia's Ash Barty in the 2022 final, defeated Destanee Aiava 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-2 across nearly 2 1/2 hours.",
      "That's when the fun began. First, the 31-year-old Collins \u2014 who originally planned to retire after last season but decided to return to the tour in 2025 \u2014 held her hand to her left ear and, looking into the stands at Kia Arena, said that three-word phrase a couple of times. Then, as the jeers grew louder, she began blowing kisses toward the fans.",
      "\u201cThe people that don't like you, and the people that hate you, they actually pay your bills. Obviously my professional career is not going to last forever,\u201d Collins said at her news conference, noting that anyone who \u201cbought a ticket to come out here and heckle me, it's all going toward the Danielle Collins Fund.\u201d",
      "She said she planned to spend some money on a \u201cfive-star vacation,\u201d and mentioned that she and her friends \u201clike boats; we like big boats; we like yachts.\u201d",
      "Earlier, when Collins began the customary post-match interview in the stadium, the noise from the seats kept coming and interrupted her first answer. So she paused and grinned, then said: \u201cI was thinking during the match ... as long as I'm out here, I might as well take that big fat check.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cThank you for coming out here and supporting us tonight.\u201d",
      "After speaking briefly about her next opponent \u2014 another American, No. 19 Madison Keys, who reached the final of the 2017 U.S. Open \u2014 Collins turned her attention back to the crowd and closed by saying, \u201cThanks, everyone. Thank you, guys. Love ya!\u201d",
      "Aiava is ranked only 195th and needed to go through qualifying rounds to earn a spot in the women's bracket. But she gave Collins a tough contest.",
      "\u201cI wasn't super surprised by how Destanee was playing,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI just had to ... do everything I can.\u201d",
      "Collins, who is from Florida and played college tennis at Virginia, famously got into a post-match spat with Iga Swiatek at the Paris Olympics last August.",
      "As for the acrimony out there on court with the paying customers on Thursday, Collins said: \u201cI loved it. I've been doing this my whole life. I love playing (in front of) a crowd that has energy, regardless of which side they're on. It kind of motivates me more.\u201d",

      "\u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s a very accurate (depiction) of the actual player that\u2019s playing. So it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s funny and weird,\u201d said 2021 U.S. Open finalist Leylah Fernandez, who will face Gauff in the third round Friday. \u201cI did not see myself just yet. Maybe I will. Now I\u2019m curious, because I\u2019ve seen different players ... and I think I want to watch myself, too.\u201d",
      "Tennis Australia created its own \u201cskins\u201d to represent players, chair umpires and ball persons.",
      "\u201cThe wonderful part of it is it\u2019s the players\u2019 actual movement. It\u2019s the actual trajectory of the ball,\u201d Machar Reid, Tennis Australia\u2019s director of innovation, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the real into the unreal. That\u2019s part of the magic.\u201d",
      "Carlos Alcaraz, a four-time Grand Slam champion at age 21, called it \u201ca good alternative.\u201d",
      "Like many players preparing for future opponents, Fernandez often scours YouTube to try to find footage of past matches to aid with scouting. That, Fernandez said with a chuckle, is how she accidentally discovered the cartoonish replays from Melbourne Park that have been creating a buzz among the competitors.",
      "She was having trouble finding a certain match when she noticed a thumbnail photo of two players, Fernandez said.",
      "\u201cSo I click on it and think, \u2019This is it! Finally! I have one,'\u201d Fernandez said. \"Nope. It\u2019s a Wii character, which is hilarious.\u201d",

      "\u201cI had no idea that something like that exists, so for me, it was quite funny to see that,\u201d Lehecka said. \u201cMaybe I will see myself as a game character one day. We will see.\u201d",
      "To get the chance, he'll need to play a match in Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena or John Cain Arena. Tennis Australia first experimented with this on one court during last year's tournament, hoping to attract gamers and a younger audience to the sport.",
      "The NFL, NBA and NHL also have tried this type of approach, using animation for alternate game telecasts.",
      "The 2024 debut in Melbourne \u201cwas kind of in stealth and didn\u2019t necessarily capture the world\u2019s imagination. But this year, we\u2019ve seen that happening,\u201d Reid said.",
      "The streams in the first four days of the event this week drew more than 950,000 views, according to Tennis Australia; the figure for the same time period in 2024 was about 140,000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of our DNA to innovate and try to challenge the status quo or, in this instance, provide experiences to different groups of fans that are more personalized for them to consume,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing younger kids or the gaming demographic gravitating to the sport maybe in this way. Clearly, it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d",
      "Might this eventually became the No. 1 way fans \u201cwatch\u201d sports?",
      "\u201cNot in my lifetime and not in yours, I don\u2019t think. But who knows? The world of sport and entertainment is moving so, so quickly,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re always going to be drawn to the amazing athletes doing their thing in front of our very eyes.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Macuga sisters Sam, Lauren and Alli all compete in a different ski discipline and all three could very well make the U.S. team for the Milan-Cortina Olympics next winter",
    "story": [
      "The Macuga sisters Sam, Lauren and Alli all compete in a different ski discipline and all three could very well make the U.S. team for the Milan-Cortina Olympics next winter",
      "The conversations around the dinner table can sometimes turn spicy between the Macuga sisters when one particular topic gets brought up: Whose winter event is more demanding.",
      "The trio each make compelling cases. Alli, the moguls standout, touts the knee-jarring bumps and jumps; Lauren, the downhill ski racer, cites speeds in excess of 70 mph (112.6 kph) along an icy course; and Sam, the ski jumper, offers up soaring through the air after launching off a fear-inspiring jump.",
      "Mom and dad just soak it all in.",
      "\u201cWe get a kick out of listening to them argue over whose sport is harder or more entertaining,\u201d said their father, Dan, whose son, Daniel, also is an up-and-coming ski racer. \u201cThe banter between them is just fantastic.\u201d",
      "One thing these tight-knit sisters can agree on: Just how special it would be should all three make the U.S. team for the Milan-Cortina Olympics next winter.",
      "Now that would be quite a family reunion. It\u2019s a real possibility, too. Alli, 21, had two World Cup podium finishes last season, while Sam, who turns 24 next month, is among the top American ski jumpers. Then there\u2019s Lauren, the 22-year-old who\u2019s coming off her first career World Cup win last weekend in Austria in the super-G.",
      "\u201cWe just watch all of them in awe,\u201d their father said.",
      "Each sibling was born in a different state \u2014 Sam in California, Lauren in Michigan, Alli in Washington and Daniel in Texas. Living in Dallas, an opportunity came around for the family to settle down in Park City, Utah.",
      "Amy and Dan jumped at the chance. Recreational skiers, they got their young kids involved through the Youth Sports Alliance, a program set up after the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics to encourage children to try different winter sports.",
      "Sam eventually gravitated toward ski jumping, where the elite jumpers sit on a bar about as high as a 40-story building until they glide down the runway and see how far they can fly.",
      "\u201cI remember Sam just said, \u2018Mom, dad, I\u2019m going to do this,\u2019\u201d recalled Lauren, who's competing in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, this weekend at the venue for the upcoming Olympics. \u201cI think they just thought she was skiing over jumps. And then it turns out she was jumping these HUGE jumps.\u201d",
      "For Lauren, it was the thrill of speed that led her to ski racing (once she conquered the fear). This offered an early hint of her potential: She won a junior national event with a borrowed race suit and on a pair of skis where the bottom looked as if she'd just rolled across a gravel parking lot.",
      "In the case of Alli, she tried out a little bit of everything \u2014 aerials, slopestyle, halfpipe, big mountain \u2014 before being drawn into the world of moguls by the combination of bumps and flips.",
      "A side benefit to competing in different disciplines? No sibling rivalries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have my \u2018thing\u2019 and be able to tune in and cheer for my other siblings as they do theirs,\u201d Sam said. \u201cComparing experiences and stories is so cool.\u201d",
      "Of course, all of them think their event is the most challenging. None of them, though, really want to do the other\u2019s discipline.",
      "Alli on Sam's ski jumping: \u201cWhile the idea of literally flying sounds amazing, I\u2019ll stick with the smaller airs rather than sending myself down a giant hill.\u201d",
      "Sam on Alli and the moguls: \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a sport I\u2019m leaving to the professionals (Alli).\u201d",
      "Alli on Lauren and the downhill: \u201cProps to her for being able to go that fast down a hill and still be giggling in the finish.\u201d",
      "Lauren had plenty to smile about last Sunday in St. Anton, when she captured her first World Cup win. Her childhood idol, Lindsey Vonn, even came over to the leader\u2019s box and gave her a celebratory hug (Vonn took fourth). It meant the world to Lauren, who counts a slalom ski from Vonn (or so she's been told) as a prized possession.",
      "One of the best parts for Lauren was the call home to share the news of her victory. It was still early back in Utah and her father was sleeping.",
      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Are you OK?\u2018\u201d Lauren said with a laugh. \u201cI was like, \u201cDad, I won!\u2019\"",
      "Meanwhile, Alli was getting ready to be taken to the airport by her mother.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it and rushed downstairs and we were both in shock,\" Alli said. \"It was so surreal to see her on the winner\u2019s chair.\u201d",
      "Sam was skiing in Norway with no cell service, but \"she called me the moment she had service and was like, \u2018What the heck?\u2019\u201d said Lauren, whose known for wearing bucket hats, of which she currently has around 26. \u201cIt was so fun.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to keep track of all their training and travel schedules. That\u2019s why their mom created the \u201cMacuga Calendar,\u201d a detailed, color-coded spreadsheet.",
      "This week, for instance, there\u2019s notations for Lauren racing in Cortina; Alli getting ready to travel to Waterville Valley in New Hampshire for a World Cup event; 19-year-old Daniel competing in a series of races at Mt. Bachelor in Oregon; and Sam preparing an event in Sapporo, Japan, where Amy and Dan were also heading. The calendar also features a \u201cnotes\u201d section to make sure their dogs are well taken care of while they're away.",
      "It\u2019s an invaluable tool.",
      "\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know where they are, what country they\u2019re in most of the time,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos. I don\u2019t know how my mom does it.\"",
      "Should all three sisters make their Olympic teams, it will present another logistical challenge. Their disciplines spread out all over Italy, with moguls in Livigno, ski jumping in Predazzo and ski racing in Cortina. They\u2019re hours from each other.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll make it all work,\u201d Amy said. \u201cWe'll find a way.\u201d",

      "O\u2019Neil, who takes over for Greg Norman, was CEO of Merlin Entertainments who was in charge of business operations of more than 140 of the company\u2019s attractions. He previously was CEO of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, whose holdings include the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL's New Jersey Devils.",
      "\u201cScott has the passion, the tenacity and the vision to continue leveraging LIV Golf\u2019s position as a preeminent, global sports and entertainment company and to lead our amazing teams and players for years to come,\u201d said Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and chairman of LIV Golf.",

      "LIV Golf begins its fourth season on Feb. 6 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The first U.S. event is April 4-6 at Trump Doral, a week before the Masters.",

      "Three of the home teams are favorites by at least six points, according to Bet MGM Sportsbook.",
      "Line: Chiefs minus 8 1/2",
      "Kansas City\u2019s quest for a three-peat starts against the Texans, who are coming off an impressive 32-12 win over the Los Angeles Chargers. Stroud made big plays with his arm and even had a career-long 27-yard run that sparked the offense against Los Angeles. Houston\u2019s defense baffled Justin Herbert, forcing four interceptions, including a pair by All-Pro cornerback Derek Stingley. If Stroud and the offense avoid turnovers and Joe Mixon has another 100-yard game rushing, the Texans can keep Mahomes off the field and have a chance to pull off the upset.",
      "The Chiefs beat the Texans 27-19 in Week 16. They were home for that one, too. Houston lost wide receiver Tank Dell to a knee injury on a touchdown catch in that game. Mahomes finished the season with 11 TDs and zero picks in his last six games. After sitting out in Week 18 and a bye, Mahomes and most of the starters have to avoid being rusty in their first game action in three weeks.",

      "CHIEFS: 27-17",
      "Line: Lions minus 9 1/2",
      "The Commanders keep finding ways to win late with five straight victories coming down to the final play. The victory in Tampa Bay was the franchise\u2019s first playoff win since 2006. Daniels connected often with Terry McLaurin and Dyami Brown, but Washington will need Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler to run more effectively to have a chance against Detroit. A defense that held Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers to their worst game in eight weeks has to step up against the most dynamic offense in the NFL.",
      "The Lions could get running back David Montgomery back to join Jahmyr Gibbs in an elite backfield. That should open things up even more for Jared Goff throwing to All-Pro wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and other playmakers.",
      "Since the NFL expanded to 14 playoff teams with only two getting a bye, No. 1 seeds are 3-5 against the spread in the divisional round.",

      "The Rams used a dominant defensive effort to eliminate the Vikings, sacking Sam Darnold nine times in a 27-9 victory. Getting to Hurts won\u2019t be that easy behind an offensive line that features five guys who received All-Pro votes.",
      "Plus, the Eagles are going to run the ball often with Barkley, who set a franchise record with 255 yards rushing in a 37-20 win in Los Angeles on Nov. 24.",
      "Rams coach Sean McVay vs. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio should be a classic head-to-head matchup.

      "Still, playing in Philadelphia in January is different and the Eagles are 6-0 straight up at home in the divisional round, covering the spread in five of those games.",
      "BEST BET: EAGLES: 29-17",
      "Line: Ravens minus 1",
      "Jackson vs. Allen gets all the hype but this isn\u2019t going to decide the NFL MVP. Votes were cast before the playoffs started. Jackson, who earned All-Pro honors, led Baltimore to a 28-14 win against Pittsburgh last week while Allen and the Bills routed Denver 31-7.",
      "The Ravens put a 35-10 beatdown on the Bills at home in Week 4. They\u2019re road favorites, a sign of disrespect for Buffalo. The Bills haven\u2019t been home underdogs in the playoffs since 1967 against the Chiefs.",

      "Hoping to become a two-way player in Major League Baseball just like Shohei Ohtani, 18-year-old Shotaro Morii made the rare decision to bypass Japanese professional baseball entirely and agreed Wednesday to a minor league contract with the Athletics that includes a signing bonus of $1,510,500.",
      "Top Japanese players traditionally have signed first with Nippon Professional Baseball clubs and established their professional credentials before moving to MLB as free agents or through the MLB-NPB posting process. Morii, a shortstop and right-handed pitcher, joined the A's directly from high school on the first day of the 2025 signing period.",
      "\u201cKeep following my dream to become a great player,\u201d Morii said through a translator during a Zoom news conference, wearing a gold A's jersey over a dress shirt, a green-and-gold club cap on his head. \u201cI didn't want to regret about my decision when I think about my whole life and whole career.\u201d",

      "\u201cI wanted to join to the professional baseball environment as soon as I can,\u201d Morii said.",
      "A left-handed hitter, Morii said he has been a two-way player since he was eight. He hit 45 home runs in three seasons while also pitching at Tokyo's TOHO Junior and Senior High School. He will start at the lowest minor league level in Mesa, Arizona, with the Arizona Complex League Athletics.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very talented baseball player with enough athleticism and mobility to play both shortstop and pitch,\u201d assistant general manager Dan Feinstein said. \u201cBut beyond his physical ability, the thing that jumped out at us the most is his passion for the game and his unwavering desire to be one of the next great players from Japan.\u201d",
      "Morii already was in the U.S. He will head home for a bit before reporting to the A's in March.",
      "Morii emphasized with teams he spoke with that he wanted to be a two-way player. His decision was yet another offseason move by the A's, who left Oakland and intend to play three seasons in West Sacramento, California, before moving to a planned ballpark in Las Vegas.",
      "Feinstein credited director of international scouting Steve Sharpe, Pacific Rim coordinator Adam Hislop and Japan scout Toshiyuki Tomizuka for helping reach the agreement.",
      "\u201cTommy, our scout in Japan, was able to watch a lot of their practices, his high school\u2019s practices and games last year, and then build a relationship with Shotaro and his family once MLB allowed us to do so,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cWe knew he had a strong desire to play in the States.\u201d",
      "Morii already has taken a summer class in English. Asked whether the success of Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Hideki Matsui, Yu Darvish and others in MLB helped him make his decision, Morii responded in English: \u201cYes, of course.\"",
      "Matsui, a three-time MVP of Japan's Central League, played for Oakland in 2011.",

      "The TCU women's basketball team had to forfeit two games and conduct open tryouts on campus last January because it didn\u2019t have enough healthy players",
      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- The TCU women had to forfeit two games and conduct open tryouts on campus last January because they didn't have enough healthy players.",
      "A year later, with Sedona Prince and Madison Conner both healthy and joined in the lineup by standout transfer Hailey Van Lith, the Horned Frogs (18-1) are a top-10 team and on a nine-game winning streak that includes their first 6-0 start in the Big 12 Conference.",
      "\u201cGone from the \u2018Underfrogs\u2019 and holding open tryouts to this week being ranked in the top 10 ... it's been a very magical ride,\u201d second-year TCU coach Mark Campbell said.",
      "TCU won its first 14 games in Campbell\u2019s debut last season, but Prince (broken finger) and Conner (MCL) got sidelined by injuries and senior point guard Jaden Owens sustained a season-ending knee injury within a couple of weeks after that school-record start. That left the Frogs with six available scholarship players, and two of them were on minutes restrictions coming off their own injuries.",
      "About 40 students then went through tryouts on campus the same week that TCU forfeited Big 12 games against Kansas State and Iowa State. Four of them were added to the roster before the season resumed with a 66-60 win at home last Jan. 23 over UCF, the same team the 10th-ranked Frogs beat 90-81 at home Tuesday night for their second nine-game winning streak this season.",
      "\u201cThe game that laid the foundation for TCU was a year ago when we played UCF here,\u201d Campbell said after the latest win over the Knights. \u201cToday was a really special game for our program, for the people that were a part of that game a year ago. There\u2019s a huge mural in our offices of pictures from that game that will be up there as long as I get to coach here.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-7 Prince had 27 points on 11-of-15 shooting and seven rebounds against UCF this week. Van Lith scored 20 points while matching her career high with six 3-pointers and had seven assists without a turnover, while Conner made four 3s while scoring 14 points and having six assists. The Frogs had assists on 29 of their 32 made field goals and finished with 15 3-pointers, their most ever in a Big 12 game.",
      "TCU's current nine-game winning streak followed an 85-52 loss to reigning national champion South Carolina on Dec. 8. That came at the end of the first week that the Frogs had ever been in the top 10 \u2014 then at No. 9.",
      "\u201cThat game probably is going to be the biggest blessing of our season. Honestly, it taught me a lot personally, but I think our team a lot. Each person learned different things that were needed for the rest of the season,\u201d Prince, a former Oregon player, said this week. \u201cThis is the most fun group I\u2019ve ever played with in my entire college career, my entire probably basketball career in my life.\u201d",
      "The Frogs are seeking their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2010.",
      "The four walk-ons added to the roster after open tryouts on campus last January became known as the \u201cUnderfrogs.\u201d",
      "Sophomore guard Ella Hamlin from nearby Granbury, Texas, the only of those four still with the team, is now on a full scholarship. An emotional Campbell surprised Hamlin with that news in the locker room after the win over UCF on Tuesday night, the timing being specific and symbolic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. ... It\u2019s just amazing to look back and see like how far it\u2019s come,\u201d said Hamlin, who has played only 23 minutes while appearing in 10 games this season.",
      "\u201cElla\u2019s the lone survivor,\" Campbell said. \"When adversity hits, most people avoid adversity, run away for adversity. The four \u2018Underfrogs', they showed up when we needed somebody.\u201d",
      "The Frogs play ranked teams in three of their next five games. They host No. 23 Utah on Friday night, which will be their first time in the AP Top 25 when hosting another ranked opponent since losing to Oklahoma State on Feb. 7, 2018.",
      "TCU next week goes to No. 24 Oklahoma State, then hosts Baylor and goes to Iowa State before a game on Feb. 5 at 11th-ranked Kansas State (17-1, 5-0), the only other Big 12 team without a conference loss.",

      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life",
      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating and fatal hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life, causing nerve cells in parts of the brain to break down and die.",
      "The genetic mutation linked to Huntington's has long been known, but scientists haven't understood how people could have the mutation from birth, but not develop any problems until later in life.",
      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

      "New Glenn is the latest in a series of big, new rockets to launch in recent years, including United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan, Europe\u2019s upgraded Ariane 6 and NASA's Space Launch System or SLS, the space agency's successor to the Saturn V for sending astronauts to the moon.",
      "The biggest rocket of all, at approximately 400 feet (123 meters), is SpaceX's Starship. Musk said the seventh test flight of the full rocket could occur later Thursday from Texas. He hopes to repeat what he pulled off in October, catching the returning booster at the launch pad with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Starship is what NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. The first two moon landings under the space agency's Artemis program, which follows the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, will see crews descending from lunar orbit to the surface in Starships.",
      "Blue Origin's lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will make its debut on the third lunar touchdown by astronauts.",

      "Trump has tapped tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman, who has twice rocketed into orbit on his own privately financed SpaceX flights, must be approved by the Senate.",
      "New Glenn's debut was supposed to send twin spacecraft to Mars for NASA. But the space agency pulled them from last October's planned flight when it became clear the rocket wouldn't be ready in time. They will still fly on a New Glenn rocket, but not until spring at the earliest. The two small spacecraft, named Escapade, are meant to study the Martian atmosphere and magnetic environment while orbiting the red planet.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",
      "Separately on Wednesday, Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, dodged a question during a Senate hearing on whether she\u2019d uphold a TikTok ban.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to \u201csave TikTok\u201d during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in southern Britain shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage",
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app",
      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app.",
      "TikTok, which has been a cultural phenomenon, could be banned on Jan. 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or shut down its U.S. operation.",
      "The fate of social media platform will be decided by the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute and seemed likely to uphold the law. The court could rule on the case as soon as this week. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to put the law on hold so he can negotiate a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue after he takes office.",
      "TikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S., and if it does get banned, it\u2019s not clear which competitors will benefit the most. Some experts think established social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, could see the biggest influx of users. But some users are looking for something different and could turn to other apps.",
      "Here are the different alternatives and what to know about them:",
      "Recently, some U.S. TikTok users have flocked to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu in protest of the looming ban. Like TikTok, Xiaohongshu, which in English means \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d combines e-commerce and short-form videos.",
      "The app has gained traction in China and other regions with a Chinese diaspora \u2014 such as Malaysia and Taiwan \u2014 racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as makeup and skincare tutorials.",
      "On Tuesday, the Xiaohongshu, called \u201cRedNote\u201d by American users and on some app stores, was the top downloaded free app in Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "Lemon8, also owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, is a lesser-known lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and short-form videos. Though the platform lets users post TikTok-like videos, it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "In the past few weeks, many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But the law that targets TikTok also states the divest-or-ban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute, its future in the U.S. is also in jeopardy.",
      "Instagram launched Reels in 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen. As of 2022, Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users. Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms.",
      "But could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators currently post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta\u2019s algorithm is addictive, it\u2019s still not TikTok.",
      "In the past, some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign.",
      "Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends, Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widely-used platform among teens and adults.",
      "YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, allowing them to watch hours of bite-sized videos. Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, remains popular among teens and younger adults. The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called \u201cStories\u201d that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours. In 2020, Snapchat launched another feature that lets users \u201cshine a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.\u201d",
      "The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year, according to eMarketer.",
      "For TikTok users who enjoy the \u201cTikTok Live\u201d feed that features livestreamed videos, Twitch could be a good alternative. The Amazon-owned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internet\u2019s most popular streamers, such as Kai Cenat. Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors.",
      "Clapper, a TikTok clone, has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban. The app was launched in 2020 by Dallas-based entrepreneur Edison Chen, and focuses on Gen X and millennial users. In September of that year, the company described itself in a Facebook post as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform that did not \u201ccensor posts and comments.\u201d But in blog post on its website from 2021, the company wrote it \u201cstopped being a \u2018Free Speech\u2019 platform\u201d in September 2020 and \u201cchanged its mission and goals\u201d to focus on \u201ccommunity\u201d.",
      "For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots, there are lesser-known apps like Triller, which is popular for music videos, and Zigazoo, which was designed with kids in mind.",
      "If none of these apps tickle your fancy, it's also possible that other platforms could emerge in the next few months as companies attempt to attract users looking for a new place to go."

      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",
      "Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them.",
      "The bill had rare support across the political spectrum, both from allies of leftist Lula and his far-right foe, former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "\u201c(Restricting cell phones) is tough, but necessary. It is useful for them to do searches for school, but to use it socially isn't good,\u201d said Ricardo Martins Ramos, 43, father of two girls and the owner of a hamburger restaurant in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cKids will interact more.\u201d",
      "His 13-year-old daughter Isabela said her classmates struggled to focus during class because of their smartphones. She approved the move, but doesn't see it as enough to improve the learning environment for everyone.",
      "\"When the teacher lets you use the cell phone, it is because he wants you to do searches,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's still a lot of things that schools can't solve, such as bullying and harassment.\u201d",
      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Last year in a U.S. Senate hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",

      "A strong earthquake has rattled southwestern Japan, but there were no reports of serious damage",
      "TOKYO -- A tsunami advisory was issued for part of southwest Japan after a magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck Monday, but the warnings to stay away from coastal areas were later lifted. A few instances of minor damage were reported.",
      "Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency initially estimated the magnitude was 6.9 but later revised it to 6.6.",
      "One man was slightly injured in Kyushu after falling down some stairs, NHK TV reported. A small landslide blocked a road, and some underground water pipes ruptured.",
      "NHK said a tsunami, estimated to be as high as 1 meter (3.2 feet), reached land within 30 minutes of the quake. The waters detected at Miyazaki Port measured 20 centimeters (0.7 feet) high, the reports said.",
      "Tsunami advisories were issued for Miyazaki prefecture, where the quake was centered, on the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi prefecture in Shikoku island, shortly after the quake struck at 9:19 p.m., JMA said. They were all lifted before midnight.",
      "Agency official Shigeki Aoki told reporters that aftershocks were possible, especially in the next two or three days.",
      "The quake, centered at a depth of 36 kilometers (22 miles), shook a wide area in Kyushu, JMA said.",
      "NHK footage showed moving traffic and well-lit streets, meaning that electric power was still working. No problems were detected at nuclear plants in the area.",
      "Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes due to its location along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.",
      "Experts at the meteorological agency met late Monday to gauge how the latest temblor may be related to the so-called Nankai Trough quakes, but decided not to take any extraordinary measures for the time being. The term refers to a wide region believed to be prone to periodic major quakes.",
      "A Nankai Trough quake off Shikoku in 1946 killed more than 1,300 people. The area was hit by a 7.1 magnitude quake in August last year.",

      "An international team of scientists say they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice that's at least 1.2 million years old",
      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",
      "The European Union funded Beyond EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) with support from nations across the continent. Italy is coordinating the project.",
      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

    "summary": "While the Starship is lost, the mission's first-stage booster successfully returned to the launch tower, where it was caught by the tower's robotic arms.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk said a leak above the ship's engine firewall may have occurred.",
      "SpaceX conducted the seventh flight test of its Starship launch vehicle on Thursday, which the company called \"the most capable\" Starship yet -- and the only fully reusable one.",
      "It was a mixed bag for the aerospace giant, however, as they successfully caught the first stage booster upon its return to Earth, but lost communications with the Starship as it headed into space.",
      "The more than 400-foot rocket, powered by 33 Raptor engines, appeared to lift off successfully at 4:37 p.m. CT from SpaceX's launchpad at its Starbase facility near Brownsville, Texas.",
      "But minutes into the mission, ground control announced during a live stream of the mission that it had lost all communications with the ship.",
      "The company said they lost several engines and telemetry and that the ship had been lost.",
      "There were no astronauts on board the test flight mission.",
      "SpaceX added that the rocket used Thursday is a new version of the Starship.",
      "While the Starship is lost, the super heavy first-stage booster successfully executed a controlled descent back to the launch tower, where it was caught by the launch tower's giant robotic arms. This is considered one of the most challenging aspects of the mission.",
      "Thursday's feat marked the second time that SpaceX has been able to return and catch the stage booster using the launch tower.",
      "Following the loss of the spacecraft, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly announced it was slowing flights in and around Florida due to the possibility of falling debris from the SpaceX launch.",
      "Footage of debris falling from the sky was seen over the Turks and Caicos Islands on Thursday.",
      "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took social media on Thursday to address the launch, saying that an oxygen or fuel leak in the cavity could have occurred above the ship engine firewall.",
      "\"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "\"Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area,\" Musk added.",
      "He indicted that so far none of the company's findings would have them push the next launch past next month.",
      "Sharing a video of the debris falling, Musk wrote, \"Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!\"",
      "Despite the loss, SpaceX has high hopes for the future of the Starship spacecraft. Unlike the Falcon 9 rocket, which has been used for years to carry satellites and astronauts to orbit with a partially reusable design, SpaceX says Starship will be fully reusable and will eventually include a heat shield that can be rapidly redeployed without significant refurbishing.",
      "SpaceX says Starship can carry larger payloads, such as satellites and cargo, than other launch vehicles and can support long-duration missions to the Moon and potentially Mars.",
      "Additionally, the company says the launch system will eventually be capable of carrying up to 100 people on long-duration interplanetary flights.",
      "SpaceX says the test flight introduced a redesigned upper stage with enhancements such as an improved heat shield, increased propellant capacity and updated avionics.",
      "The company says the updates will improve the vehicle's reliability and enable longer more complex missions.",
      "During the mission, which has now been scrapped, the spacecraft planned to deploy 10 Starlink satellite simulators for the first time, testing its ability to deliver payloads in space.",
      "The simulators were set to be placed on a suborbital trajectory, with splashdown planned in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The mission was planning to test new materials and design changes to enhance the spacecraft's heat resistance during reentry.",
      "Ahead of the launch, the company said it purposely removed heat tiles to test the vehicle's heat resiliency.",

      "The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed thousands of structures since Jan. 7. In Altadena, north of Pasadena, the Eaton Fire has damaged or destroyed 7,000 structures.",
      "One of the structures destroyed by the fire was the home Erion and Stephan Taylor lived in with their three children. They say they only had 20 minutes to evacuate on Jan. 7.",

      "\"My heart dropped, I saw the flames, and I said 'Honey, come here for a second' and he looked out the door and his whole demeanor changed,\" Erion Taylor told ABC News.",
      "The Taylors quickly packed their most precious items -- wedding photos, loved ones' ashes, stuffed animals and soccer cleats -- into the car. They made their escape to Stephan\u2019s mother\u2019s home -- Peggy Taylor lives a 7-minute drive down the hill.",
      "However, the flames quickly threatened her home as well and the family fled. Since then, they have been living in a hotel room.",
      "\"The kids need a yard. They need a familiar space,\" Erion said. \"They need a kitchen table or a room to go to and shut the door if they want to be by themselves for a little bit.\"",
      "Erion said they\u2019re hurt over what they lost, but her focus remains on what they still have -- each other.",

      "Black families began moving to the area in the '30s, during the Great Migration, and Altadena became a multicultural haven in the '60s. This was a result of Black people being able to get mortgages and Altadena being free of \"redlining\" -- a practice that saw federally insured mortgages, loans and private residential insurance being withheld from non-white homeowners.",
      "Peggy Taylor, known as Ms. Peggy, moved to the area when she was 17. The home she bought in the '60s has housed both her boys and their families at some point or another, making it a haven for their family. Miraculously, that house was spared by the fire.",
      "\"To see it standing and there's no additional wind damage, doesn't look like it's been burglarized, makes me feel a lot better,\" Ms. Peggy told ABC News.",

      "People are already banding together to help rebuild what\u2019s been lost in Altadena -- an effort that's giving the Taylors hope.",
      "\"We create, not destroy, and we are going to create our neighborhoods,\" Erion said. \"And we're standing in front of a sign that says 'Altadena is not for sale,' because every single person here wants to make sure that the people are taken care of.\"",

An eighth fire ignited Monday night near Oxnard in neighboring Ventura County, but fire crews held it to 61 acres.",

      "A marine layer and even some clouds could bring a chance for a sprinkle to Southern California late Thursday and into Friday.",
      "Up to more than 15,000 firefighters, including crews from outside the state and nation, are taking advantage of the calmer weather to increase fire containment lines, pre-position equipment in crews in vulnerable areas and use air tankers to coat hillsides in front of the burn areas with fire retardant in advance of the next Santa Ana wind event, officials said.",

A cafe called Fox's, open since 1955, was just down the street.",

Meg packed up her stuff and Reese\u2019s essential items \u2014 school backpack, a few stuffed animals. I started packing wine bottles, thought, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d and put them back. We got passports and birth certificates. A litter box and some wet food for the cats. We loaded both cars.",

      "We first encountered Altadena when Reese attended the Summerkids camp there. I felt the city's hustle-bustle melt away each morning that I drove her past the towering pines, deodar cedars and maple trees that lined the calm streets. When Reese was 5, we found a three-bedroom, two-bath home that had a backyard view of the San Gabriel Mountains and a tree out front with thick branches perfect for hanging a swing.",

      "We loved the mixture of people around us, nods and greetings from neighbors when we walked down our sidewalk-less street. Along with a deep-rooted Black community, the hush and space and trees and birds and relatively affordable homes have long drawn musicians, artists and artisans from the LA area\u2019s more-blue-collar-than-you-think creative community.",
      "When the weather was right, I walked down the driveway and hiked uphill to the trail leading up to Echo Mountain and eventually to Inspiration Point. It was so accessible, I called it \u201cmy mountain.\" On Echo Mountain you could find the remains of a resort and hotel that burned in fires in the early 1900s. Once, when I hiked up with Reese, she and a friend dug in the dirt and uncovered pieces of a pot that we carried down, cleaned up and tried to piece back together.",
      "Two years ago, a family moved in next door to us with two daughters. They all became like sisters, and the girls would climb atop our garage to watch fireworks on the Fourth of July, play ping-pong in the back yard or sit in Reese\u2019s room and play Roblox. We adopted Luke and Archie, our two orange tabby cats. The cats, with us before the pandemic, helped get us through that hard time (including a few weeks of lockdown with nearby fires on the mountain keeping us indoors for days on end). Meg envisioned eventually building a \u201ccatio\u201d for them outside.",
      "After Meg\u2019s father died, we used her inheritance to remodel. Meg modernized and styled every corner while retaining the house's midcentury character. She curated the artwork, paintings, photographs, wood sculptures and trinkets from places we\u2019d visited in the before times.",
      "One Christmas, Meg surprised me by converting the garage into a man cave/study with a TV, elliptical and spin bike and her dad\u2019s old roll-top desk. We put sheds in the back for storage: photo albums from the time before digital photos, holiday ornaments, scrapbooks with my earliest newspaper clippings and Meg\u2019s elementary school class photos and report cards. All now gone.",
      "I ended up working from home a lot and walked a three-mile loop through the neighborhood that gave me a regular view of the community's variety: yards filled with cars in various states of disrepair. People in cowboy hats riding horses down the pavement. Ultra-modern new homes with glass walls. Coyotes \u2014 and dog walkers who carried thick sticks to fend them off. Rainbow flags and \u201cIn this house ...\u201d signs and Black Lives Matter signs and Harris signs and a couple Trump signs. A cul-de-sac on a hillside with a house where a motion-activated robot voice told me I was being recorded every time I walked past.",
      "Works of humans and works of nature. The predictable and the unexpected. The entire tapestry. All of these things, and more, made it our home.",
      "The night we left last week, we went to stay the night with friends in northeast LA's San Rafael Hills. I woke up at about 6 a.m. and headed back to Altadena.",
      "From the freeway, it resembled the scene in \u201cFury Road\u201d where there\u2019s a swirling wall of orange as the vehicles enter the sandstorm. But I drove into an all-black cloud of smoke instead.",

      "I tried to drive up to check. I turned back when the smoke got too thick to see the street and I was encircled by flames.",

      "I didn\u2019t even get out of my car. I just looked long enough to absorb it: Like nearly the entire community, our whole block had burned. Reese's tree swing and the backyard ping-pong table were still there, plus our chimney and fireplace, with brick painted white. Everything else \u2014 everything in this place where we had chosen to live our lives and raise our child \u2014 was simply gone, as if it had never been there in the first place. But I knew better. I had lived it.",

      "The suit was filed in the California Superior Court on Monday and seeks damages for the costs, repair and replacement of damaged or destroyed property; cost for alternative living expenses; loss of wages, earning capacity or profits and any other relief a court deems appropriate.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the water supply system servicing areas in and around Pacific Palisades on the date of the Palisades Fire failed, and that this failure was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "\"Among other failures, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, a 117-million-gallon water storage complex that is part of the Los Angeles water supply system, was empty, leaving fire crews little to no water to fight the Palisades Fire,\" the complaint said.",
      "\"Further, despite dire warnings by the National Weather Service of a 'Particularly Dangerous Condition -- Red Flag Warning' of 'critical fire weather' which had the potential for rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior, the LADWP was unprepared for the Palisades Fire,\" the suit added.",

      "In a statement issued before the lawsuit was filed, LADWP said it \"was required to take the Santa Ynez Reservoir out of service to meet safe drinking water regulations. To commission the support and resources to implement repairs to Santa Ynez, LADWP is subject to the city charter's competitive bidding process which requires time.\"",
      "\"The water system serving the Pacific Palisades area and all of Los Angeles meets all federal and state fire codes for urban development and housing,\" the statement said. \"LADWP built the Pacific Palisades water system beyond the requirements to support the community's typical needs.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power told ABC News the agency does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "The extent of the economic damage wrought by the unprecedented fires is not yet clear.

After accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion, the report said.",
      "The investigation into the cause and spread of the Palisades Fire is ongoing, even as firefighters continue their effort to contain that and other wildfires blazing around the Los Angeles area.",

Let's take a look.",

      "TIMONER: It's, it's an unfathomable loss for so many people and for our beautiful town of Altadena. Everything I ever had was in the house -- I was in Europe shooting a film about the Nazis at the time. So I wasn't able to pull anything out. So I'm just sort of grappling with the chaos of it and the loss. And I and, you know, of course, having made this film and have so many dear friends who are homeless to be among them now is something. It feels very, very intense and very scary.",
      "ABC NEWS:\u00a0I think that part of the film just deals with the idea of just how unexpected homelessness can be. You have one gentleman who's there who talks about how he lost his house in a divorce. The wife got the divorce, and all of a sudden he was homeless. And, and many of us think, they are different. What did you learn about the people who were without a home?",
      "TIMONER: Well, I think what is really a unique sort of opportunity with \"The INN-Between,\" which is the name of the actual place, is that it elevates the people that are in there. They have community. They have a resident council. They go on field trips. They are treated with love and care.",
      "And so they're able to really express what it is to be homeless from a very different perspective than I've ever seen in a film before. It's quite an uplifting experience to be there. Like every time we would go there to shoot, we'd never want to leave. And what I learned is they're just like us, you know? I mean, here, here I am homeless now as well. It happens in an instant.",

      "TIMONER: You know, it was a real struggle for them. And now those same neighbors are volunteering there, doing jewelry-making classes and, you know, sing-alongs. And there's a piano there.",
      "ABC NEWS: Why don't you, why do you think we don't see more of these inns? Because when we talk about in broad strokes in our country, about how we have a problem with homelessness, we have a problem with drug addiction, we have a problem with mental illness. But this seems to be, in small part, a solution if we could have this across the country.",
      "TIMONER: That's why we made the movie and that's why it's going to be out on the LA Times site and hopefully get even further with distribution. We hope that everyone will see this. We hope that mayors will realize that if they actually help an INN-Between happen in their town, then they will see such a great result.",
      "Not only will there be less people on the streets, there'll be no one dying on the streets anymore, and the emergency rooms won't have the kind of, you know, constant flow of people in need who just can't get care otherwise.",

      "A 4-year-old girl who was in the back seat of a vehicle when it was stolen early Thursday morning has been found safe following an hourslong search, police in Illinois said.",
      "No other details on her whereabouts were immediately released.",
      "The abduction was reported at approximately 6:07 a.m. in Rock Island, police said. The vehicle had been left running with the child, Blessing Aoci, inside while her mother went inside a residence when it was stolen by an unknown suspect, according to Illinois State Police.",
      "The vehicle was recovered nearly 20 minutes later, at approximately 6:24 a.m., less than a mile away, though the child was not inside, police said. Three booster seats that had been in the back seat were also missing, according to Rock Island Police Chief Timothy McCloud.",
      "Rock Island police updated Thursday afternoon that Blessing had been found safe.",
      "\"Blessing has been located, she is safe, she has been reunited with her mother, and will evaluated by EMS,\" the police department said. \"Further details will be forthcoming.\"",
      "An Amber Alert had been issued for the girl, and police conducted door-to-door canvassing and used drones in the search effort, McCloud said.",
      "Amid the search, McCloud said they haven't ruled out any possibilities including this being a targeted kidnapping, but police currently believe the abduction to be \"inadvertent.\"",
      "\"We are hoping that there are people, even anonymously, that can give us information about where that child was taken out of the car or where that child is right now,\" he said during a press briefing earlier Thursday. \"Our hope is that she's safe inside a house nearby in the neighborhoods, and that's why we're going door-to-door with her picture.\"",
      "McCloud said the incident \"happened in seconds.\"",
      "\"That's what we try to tell people, that you can take one child and put them in the car and then go back to the house to get another child, and in the meantime, that car's gone,\" he said. \"It's that fast.\""

      "WASHINGTON -- A Missouri man who crashed a rental truck into barriers protecting the White House was sentenced Thursday to eight years in prison for an attack that prosecutors said was inspired by his fascination with Nazi ideology, court records show.",
      "Sai Varshith Kandula, then 19, nearly struck two people standing next to a park bench when he steered a U-Haul box truck onto a sidewalk and toward metal bollards that prevent vehicles from entering Lafayette Square, which is located north of the White House. He retrieved a Nazi flag from a backpack after the May 22, 2023, crash, which didn't injure anybody.",
      "Kandula wanted to \u201cattack and destroy\u201d the U.S. government, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to eliminate the democratic process in America and replace the government with a Nazi style dictatorship,\" they wrote.",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich also sentenced Kandula to three years of supervised release after his prison term and ordered him to pay nearly $57,000 in restitution, according to court records.",
      "Defense attorney Scott Rosenblum said Kandula was suffering from schizophrenia and was overwhelmed by delusional thoughts, including his belief that \u201ca reptilian race had installed a puppet regime to operate the U.S.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s amenable to treatment, understands its necessity, and recognizes an illness produced the acts that led to his current circumstances,\u201d Rosenblum wrote.",
      "Prosecutors recommended an eight-year prison sentence for Kandula, who pleaded guilty in May to a property damage charge. He has remained in custody since his arrest.",
      "Kandula planned the attack for weeks before he took a flight from St. Louis to Washington, D.C. only hours before the crash, prosecutors said. He rented the truck in Herndon, Virginia approximately three hours before he crashed it into the barriers.",
      "After Kandula backed up and slammed into the bollards a second time, the truck began smoking from its engine compartment and leaking fluids.",
      "Authorities didn\u2019t find any weapons, ammunition or explosives in his possession. But prosecutors said the attempted assassination of President-elect Donald Trump at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania shows that \"individuals who carry such destructive intent are capable of inflicting serious damage to the American political system.\u201d",
      "Police body camera video captured the aftermath of the crash. After his arrest, Kandula told investigators that he purchased the swastika flag because \u201cNazis have a great history.\"",
      "\u201cHe specifically praised Adolf Hitler. And it wasn\u2019t just words \u2014 when his truck was disabled in the attack, the first thing he did was unfurl the flag of Nazi Germany,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "After Kandula's arrest, two psychologists diagnosed him with schizophrenia, according to Rosenblum.",
      "\u201cBoth also believe his illness led directly to his offense,\u201d the lawyer wrote.",
      "Rosenblum said Kandula's conviction will likely result in his deportation to India."

      "The Supreme Court 's decision could come Friday in the case about whether TikTok must shut down in a few days under a federal law that seeks to force its sale by the Chinese company that owns the social media platform used by 170 million people in the U.S.",
      "The justices are weighing a free speech challenge to the law, which takes effect Sunday, against the national security concerns that prompted its enactment with broad bipartisan support last year. A lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese owner, told the court last week that TikTok will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Sunday unless the justices grant it a temporary reprieve or strike down the law.",
      "During courtroom arguments, most of the justices seemed likely to uphold the law.",

President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported banning the app, is exploring options to \u201cpreserve\u201d TikTok, his incoming national security adviser, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, said in a televised interview on Wednesday.",
      "It's not clear what authority Trump has to intervene, although he could direct the Justice Department not to enforce the law, which threatens sanctions against the technology companies that make the app available and host it.",
      "The Supreme Court indicated Thursday that the justices will issue at least one decision Friday, adhering to its custom of not saying which one. But it also departed from its usual practice in some respects, heightening the expectation that it\u2019s the TikTok case that will be handed down.",

      "The super-rich have long played a role in U.S. politics but have an unusually prominent spot in incoming President Donald Trump's new administration",
      "President Joe Biden's pointed warning about the U.S. becoming an \u201c oligarchy \u201d of tech billionaires will be illustrated at Donald Trump's inauguration, when the world's three richest men will sit on the dais as Trump is sworn in for a second term.",
      "Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, took an unprecedented, hands-on role in the final stretch of Trump's campaign, spending some $200 million through a super PAC. Musk has a new role reshaping government in the upcoming administration and will be joined on the dais by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Both men's companies have enormous contracts with the federal government.",
      "Rounding out the trio is Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who recently changed his company\u2019s priorities to align with Trump\u2019s and has cozied up to the president-elect less than six months after Trump threatened to imprison him.",
      "The three men are worth nearly $1 trillion combined and will be joined at the inauguration by the chief executive officers of OpenAI and the social media platform TikTok, which is scheduled to be shut down in the U.S. over the weekend under a new law that Trump opposes.",
      "Meta, Amazon and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund.",
      "The mega-rich have long had a prominent role in national politics, and several billionaires helped bankroll the campaign of Trump's Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden recently gave the presidential medal of freedom to George Soros, a billionaire donor to liberal causes.",
      "But the inaugural display highlights the unusually direct role billionaires have in the incoming administration. Biden's use of the word \u201coligarchy\u201d was no accident \u2014 it's a direct reference to the form of government in Russia, whose leader Trump has long spoken warmly about. Russian President Vladimir Putin preserves the uber-rich's wealth and keeps them under control with threats.",
      "Here's a look at the dynamics of the incoming administration and the mega-rich:",
      "Inequality in the U.S. actually dropped during most of Biden's term and is slightly lower than it was 10 years ago, but remains quite high historically.",
      "Consider that the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans \u2014 about 131,000 households \u2014 owned nearly 14% of the nation\u2019s wealth as of last fall, or more than $22 trillion in stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve. That is up from up from 10% two decades ago.",
      "The bottom half of the U.S. population \u2014 or about 65 million households \u2014 collectively own just 2.4% of the nation's wealth, or just under $4 trillion, according to Federal Reserve data.",
      "A relatively new development, however, is the stratospheric levels of wealth of a handful of the country's several hundred billionaires.",
      "Musk, for example, is worth $450 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos, at $242 billion and Zuckerberg, at $212 billion, have also reached new heights. They are the only people worth more than $200 billion in the world. All but two of the top 10 wealthiest people in the world are technology moguls.",
      "The exploding levels of affluence have led Democrats to try to revamp the U.S. tax code to target wealth. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed a wealth tax during her unsuccessful 2020 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Democrats in 10 states last year unsuccessfully tried to create wealth taxes. Several Democratic-leaning states impose higher taxes on those making more than $1 million as a way to address income inequality.",
      "Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance \u2014 who worked as a venture capitalist with conservative Silicon Valley billionaire, Peter Thiel \u2014 and others in their inner circle identify themselves as men of the people, promising to wrest back power from interest groups and elites and restore it to Americans.",
      "Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative influencer, has repeatedly called the U.S. government an \u201coligarchy\u201d that rejects the will of the citizens for its own military and financial interests.",
      "Trump, of course, is himself a billionaire. And part of his pitch has always been a billionaire-focused form of populism. He and his allies have argued that a vast array of intellectual elites \u2014 lawyers, executives, journalists and academics \u2014 have held back the country's lower and middle class and that rich entrepreneurs can free them.",
      "That tension came out Thursday during the confirmation hearing of Trump's nominee to be Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent. Vermont's Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders noted high levels of wealth inequality in the country and the control the mega-rich have over social media.",
      "\u201cWould you agree with President Biden that an oligarchy is taking shape in America?\u201d Sanders asked Bessent.",
      "The nominee replied: \u201cThe billionaires you listed make the money themselves.\"",
      "Bessent, a hedge fund manager, is one of several billionaires Trump has tapped for his Cabinet.",
      "The term \u201coligarch\u201d has been most associated with Russia in modern times.",
      "After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, a group of businessmen took advantage of the privatizing of state industries under then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin to quickly snap up vast holdings.",
      "They became known as \u201coligarchs,\u201d and by the time Putin came to power in 2000, they had amassed both vast wealth and power while millions of ordinary Russians had struggled through turbulent economic times.",
      "After Putin took office, he met with top oligarchs at a closed-door meeting in the Kremlin and reportedly offered a deal: Stay out of politics and your wealth won\u2019t be touched.",
      "Russian oligarchs who didn't end up imprisoned or dead became uber-wealthy and largely remain under Putin's control.",
      "The U.S. is a long way from Russian-style oligarchy, with a diverse, strong economy and resilient institutions. The risk is that if wealth is increasingly determined by executives' relationships with the government, it can increase inequality and lead to stagnation for most. That's the cautionary tale of Russia.",
      "Some worry that's starting to happen in the U.S. as Trump prepares to take office. Just look at the technology sector, with which Trump spent much of his first term feuding with and vowing to retaliate against if he returned to office.",
      "Google and Microsoft both reportedly donated $1 million to the president-elect\u2019s inauguration fund. Zuckerberg is cohosting a reception with wealthy Republican donors next week for the inauguration, and Microsoft's chief executive officer had lunch with Trump and Vance at Trump's Florida headquarters at Mar-A-Lago this week.",
      "And Amazon recently bought exclusive rights to a documentary about Trump\u2019s wife, incoming first lady Melania Trump.",

    "story": [
      "It's one of the most enduring images of the Vietnam War \u2014 an Associated Press photograph of a young girl running naked down a street after being caught in a napalm attack",
      "It is one of the 20th century's most memorable images: a naked girl, screaming, running from a napalm bombing during the Vietnam War. More than a half-century later, a new documentary is calling into question who took it \u2014 and the retired Associated Press photographer long credited for the photo insists it was his, while his longtime employer says it has no evidence of anyone else being behind the camera.",
      "The film about the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d is scheduled to debut next week at the Sundance Film Festival. Both photographer Nick Ut and his longtime employer are contesting it vigorously, and Ut's lawyer is seeking to block the premiere, threatening a defamation lawsuit. The AP, which conducted its own investigation over six months, concluded it has \u201cno reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.\u201d",
      "The picture of Kim Phuc running down a road in the village of Trang Bang, crying and naked because she had taken off clothes burning from napalm, instantly became symbolic of the horrors of the Vietnam War.",
      "Taken on June 8, 1972, the photo is credited to Ut, then a 21-year-old staffer in AP's Saigon bureau. He was awarded the Pulitzer a year later. Now 73, he moved to California after the war and worked for the AP for 40 years until retiring in 2017.",
      "The film's allegations open an unexpected new chapter for an image that, within hours of it being taken, was beamed around the planet and became one of the most indelible photographs of both the Vietnam War and the turbulent century that produced it. Whatever the truth, the film's investigations apparently relate only to the identity of the photographer and not the image's overall authenticity.",
      "The dispute puts the filmmakers, who call the episode \u201ca scandal behind the making of one of the most-recognized photographs of the 20th century,\u201d at odds with Ut, whose work that day defined his career. It also puts them at cross purposes with the AP, a global news organization for whom accuracy is a foundational part of the business model.",
      "It's difficult, so many years later, to overestimate the wallop that this particular image packed. Ron Burnett, an expert on images and former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, called it \u201cearth-shattering.\"",
      "\u201cIt changed the way photos have always been thought about and broke the rules for how much violence you can show to the public,\u201d Burnett said.",
      "The photo sat unchallenged for much of its 53-year existence. All these years later, a counter-narrative has emerged that it was instead taken by another person, someone who worked for NBC News at the time and also lives now in California. The person allegedly had delivered his film to the AP's office as a \u201cstringer,\u201d a non-staff member who provides material to a news organization.",
      "The husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner are behind the film. On his website, Knight described \u201cThe Stringer\u201d as \u201ca story that many in our profession did not want told, and some of them continue to go to great lengths to make sure isn\u2019t told.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe film grapples with questions of authorship, racial injustice and journalistic ethics while shining a light on the fundamental yet often unrecognized contributions of local freelancers who provide the information we need to understand how events worldwide impact us all,\u201c Knight wrote.",
      "Knight did not return a message seeking comment from the AP on Thursday. A representative from Sundance also did not return a message about a cease-and-desist letter from Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, trying to stop the film's airing. Hornstein would not make Ut available for an interview, saying he anticipated future litigation.",
      "Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP declined.",
      "That hampered the AP's own investigation, along with the passage of time. Horst Faas, chief of photos for AP in Saigon in 1972, and Yuichi \u201cJackson\u201d Ishizaki, who developed Ut's film, are both dead. Many of the Saigon bureau's records were lost when communists took over the city, including any dealings with \u201cthe stringer.\u201d Negatives of photos used back then are preserved in AP's corporate archives in New York, but they provided no insight for the investigation.",
      "Still, the AP decided to release its own findings before seeing \u201cThe Stringer\u201d and the details of the claim that it is making. \u201cAP stands prepared to review any evidence and take whatever remedial action might be needed if their thesis is proved true,\u201d the news organization said.",
      "The AP said it spoke to seven surviving people who were in Trang Bang or AP's Saigon bureau that day, and all maintain they have no reason to doubt their own conclusions that Ut had taken the photo.",
      "One was Fox Butterfield, a renowned longtime New York Times reporter, who also said that he was contacted by Turner for the documentary. \u201cI told them what my memory was and they didn't like it, but they just went ahead anyway,\u201d Butterfield told AP.",
      "Another was photographer David Burnett, who said he witnessed Ut and Alexander Shimkin, a freelance photographer working primarily for Newsweek, taking photos as Kim Phuc and other children emerged from smoke following an attack. Shimkin was killed in Vietnam a month later, according to the investigation.",
      "A key source for the story in \u201cThe Stringer\u201d is Carl Robinson, then a photo editor for the AP in Saigon, who was initially overruled in his judgment not to use the picture. AP reached out to Robinson as part of its probe, but he said he had signed an NDA with Knight and the VII Foundation. Knight followed up, saying Robinson would only speak off the record, which the AP concluded would have prevented the news organization from setting the record straight.",
      "Robinson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Thursday.",
      "On duty that day in Saigon, Robinson had concluded that Ut's picture could not be used because it would have violated standards prohibiting nudity. But Faas overruled him, and senior AP editors in New York decided to run the picture for what it conveyed about war.",
      "The AP questioned Robinson's long silence in contradicting Ut's photo credit, and showed a photo from its archives of Robinson with champagne toasting Ut's Pulitzer Prize. In a 2005 interview with corporate archives, Robinson said he thought AP \u201ccreated a monster\u201d when it distributed the photo because much of the world's sympathies were focused on one victim, instead of war victims more broadly.",
      "Former AP correspondent Peter Arnett, who believes Ut made the image, said Robinson wrote to him after Faas' death in 2012 to make the allegation that Ut had not taken it; he said he did not want to do it while Faas was still alive. According to the AP investigation, Arnett said Robinson told him that Ut had \u201cgone all Hollywood\u201d and he didn't like it.",
      "Hornstein characterized Robinson, who was dismissed by AP in 1978, as \u201ca guy with a 50-year vendetta against the AP.\u201d He also questioned the long silence by the man supposedly identified in the documentary as the person who really took the photo.",
      "The lawyer also produced a statement from Kim Phuc, who said that while she has no memory of that day, her uncle has repeatedly told her that Ut took the picture and that she had no reason to doubt him. Ut also took her to the nearest hospital after the photo was taken, she wrote.",

      "There were sports analogies galore but few policy specifics during Scott Turner \u2019s confirmation hearing on Thursday to become housing secretary.",
      "Turner spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee as he seeks to become leader of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for President-elect Donald Trump. The hearing focused on how Turner would address housing affordability and homelessness, reform HUD\u2019s massive portfolio of housing subsidies, and tackle housing discrimination initiatives.",
      "It marked some of the former NFL player\u2019s most detailed comments to date on the nation\u2019s housing issues. Here\u2019s a look at the highlights.",
      "Though he ran the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump\u2019s first term, little was known about Turner\u2019s housing policy ideas before Thursday's hearing. He introduced himself as an underdog from Texas who came from a \u201cbroken\u201d family due to his parents\u2019 divorce.",
      "Turner also got personal when discussing the nation\u2019s homelessness crisis. He shared how he and his family helped his uncle, who was a homeless veteran.",
      "\u201cWhen they found him, my family and I were able to come around him, to love him, to take him in, to give him the wraparound services that he needed,\u201d Turner said.",
      "He also called out HUD\u2019s recent report acknowledging an 18.1% increase in homelessness in the U.S., with 770,000 people who were counted as homeless in 2024.",
      "\u201cHUD, if you will, is failing at its most basic mission,\" Turner said. \"And that has to come to an end.\u201d",
      "There were also many references to his professional football career, including his own quip that drew chuckles in the room about being drafted in the 7th round of the NFL, \u201cwhich is the last round for those that don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Turner was pressed for specifics on how he would reform HUD\u2019s massive portfolio of housing subsidies, with Democrats repeatedly asking if he supports Section 8 voucher programs.",
      "Turner didn\u2019t commit to increasing the number of vouchers, which is a longstanding priority for Democrats, but said he wanted to make it more efficient and less cumbersome for landlords who rent their units to voucher-holders.",
      "Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona, implored Turner to protect U.S. citizens in HUD housing even if undocumented people were in their household. Only people legally in the country can receive HUD subsidies, though Trump\u2019s first administration had tried unsuccessfully to limit their eligibility if they live with people who may not have approved immigration status.",
      "Turner responded that he would uphold the laws on the books.",
      "\u201cWe do not like to tear up families, but we have an obligation to serve the American people,\u201d he said.",
      "Turner also said he supported tying work requirements to HUD housing programs.",
      "Turner, the only Black person being nominated to Trump's Cabinet, was also asked about his vision for HUD as the enforcer of the nation\u2019s fair housing laws.",
      "He committed to upholding fair housing laws, though he didn\u2019t address how he may change or gut Obama- and Biden-era initiatives to curb housing discrimination.",
      "He also sidestepped a question on how he\u2019d speak up in favor of fair housing policies if Trump seeks to weaken any protections.",
      "Turner was also asked how he\u2019d respond to Trump if there are significant budget cuts proposed for HUD.",
      "\u201cI do commit to having those conversations with the president and with Congress as it pertains to being an ambassador and a voice for HUD, and to maximize the budget that we are given,\u201d Turner said.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has appointed Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas as the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson appointed Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., as the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday after asserting that the panel needed a fresh start.",
      "\u201cHe has earned the respect of his colleagues through his years of faithful service on the committee and his steady approach to the challenges facing our country,\u201d Johnson said in announcing the appointment of Crawford, who is beginning his eighth term in the House.",
      "Johnson shocked lawmakers with the announcement Wednesday that he was removing Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio from the post. However, Turner had been at odds with President-elect Donald Trump on some issues. For example, he supported efforts to aid Ukraine in its attempts to repel Russia's military.",
      "Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns that Turner's removal weakens the panel's independence in conducting oversight on intelligence matters. Trump has picked fierce loyalists to lead agencies with vast power for surveillance. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries called Turner a \u201chighly-principled leader.\u201d",
      "\u201cMike Turner has robustly promoted the safety of the American people and the Free World and his unjustified ouster is likely being applauded by our adversaries in Russia and China. Shameful,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "Crawford joined the committee in 2017. He said in a statement that \u201cabuse\u201d within the nation's security apparatus had eroded trust and compromised America's ability to gather intelligence.",
      "\u201cAs chairman, I will aggressively uphold our mandate to provide credible and robust oversight of the Intelligence Community\u2019s funding and activities,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout aggressive oversight and vigorous protection of Americans\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights, the IC is prone to give in to mission creep and skirt U.S. laws.\u201d"

      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won\u2019t...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \u201cstamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\u201d while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it\u2019s okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\u201d said Berkowitz, who is now a professor at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a serious chemical burn from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation\u2019s children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\u201d said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota,",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Alabama, California, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia.",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate. \u201cQSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\u201d he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\u201d",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children -- our most vulnerable workers -- safe,\u201d the Department said.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws."

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to be the state's next U.S. senator.",
      "The announcement comes after President-elect Donald Trump nominated U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida's senior senator since 2010, to be secretary of state.",
      "Five things to know about the Republican attorney general, who has served as the state's top law enforcement officer since 2019:",
      "Moody has spent her career in the justice system, working as a federal prosecutor before being elected at age 31 to the post of circuit judge in Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. She ran for the statewide office of attorney general in 2018, the same year DeSantis won his first bid as governor.",
      "Moody comes from a well-known Tampa Bay family and followed in the footsteps of her father, U.S. District Judge James Moody.",
      "Serving in the Florida Cabinet, Moody has repeatedly advocated for law enforcement. Her husband, Justin Duralia, became a deputy police chief in Plant City in July. Previously, he worked at the Drug Enforcement Administration for 24 years, most recently as a supervisory special agent. Together, they have two sons, Brandon and Connor.",
      "Moody has earned a reputation as a defender of the president-elect, notably when she joined 16 other Republican state attorneys general in signing on to a lawsuit asking the Supreme Court to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win.",
      "\u201cThe integrity and resolution of the 2020 election is of paramount importance,\u201d Moody wrote in a statement at the time.",
      "In December, Moody\u2019s office obtained an arrest warrant for Ryan Wesley Routh, whom federal authorities accuse of trying to assassinate Trump at his West Palm Beach country club in September.",
      "Moody is pursuing criminal charges of attempted felony murder against Routh for a crash that seriously injured a 6-year-old girl after officials shut down traffic on Interstate 95 as they tried to apprehend the suspect.",
      "Moody is poised to become just the second woman to represent the state in the U.S. Senate, and the first in nearly 40 years; Republican Paula Hawkins served in the chamber from 1981-1987.",
      "In her first statements after DeSantis announced her appointment Thursday, Moody said her experiences as a woman would shape her work in the Senate.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, I am driven by the fact that I am a mother \u2014 and I still have a kid in school,\u201d Moody said.",
      "To date, 63 women have served in the Senate, with 25 currently in office.",
      "Moody\u2019s office unsuccessfully fought to disqualify two measures from appearing on the 2024 ballot: one that would have expanded abortion rights and another that would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state.",
      "Moody accused supporters of the abortion proposal of waging a \u201cwar\u201d to protect the procedure. And she argued that the marijuana measure's language \u2014 that it \u201callows adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products\u201d \u2014 was misleading because it didn't clarify that marijuana possession is illegal under federal law.",
      "In April 2024, the Florida Supreme Court rejected Moody's arguments and allowed the marijuana and abortion measures to go before voters. While a majority of Floridians voted to pass the initiatives, both failed to meet the state\u2019s required 60% threshold to amend the constitution.",
      "Moody, who is a fifth generation Florida native from Plant City, was named the queen of the Florida Strawberry Festival in 1993. Plant City has hosted the famed celebration of the state's strawberry industry for nearly a century.",
      "Moody can claim another kind of Florida pedigree as well: She's a triple Gator, earning a bachelor's, a master's and a Juris Doctor from the University of Florida.",

      "Lee Zeldin, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, is promising to preserve a clean environment \u201cwithout suffocating the economy.\u201d",
      "Lee Zeldin said Americans deserve a clean environment \u201cwithout suffocating the economy\u201d during his Senate confirmation hearing Thursday to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a department likely to play a central role in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to slash federal regulations and promote oil and gas development.",
      "\u201cThe American people elected President Trump last November in part due to serious concerns about upward economic mobility,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cA big part of this will require building private sector collaboration to promote common sense, smart regulation.\u201d",
      "It was a mostly friendly hearing that occasionally grew pointed when Democrats questioned Zeldin about climate change asking what, if anything, Zeldin thinks should be done about a problem that has worsened floods and raised sea levels but that Trump has dismissed.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, for example, asked about basic climate science, including what impact carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels have on the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t sit before you as a scientist,\u201d Zeldin said. After a follow up question, he did say that carbon dioxide traps heat.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman serving part of Long Island, has been a longtime Trump ally. He served on Trump\u2019s defense team during his first impeachment and voted against certifying Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump led efforts to dismantle environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again. Experts and advocates believe that Zeldin\u2019s first tasks will be overturning President Joe Biden\u2019s biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashing pollution from power plants.",
      "During the hearing, however, Zeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska about whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Trump has criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged Republican opposition.",
      "\u201cI will tell you that I have heard concerns from you, and many others in this chamber, of how important it is to look at rules that are currently on the books,\u201d he said.",
      "He made it clear that he believed in strict limits on the EPA's regulatory power. He pledged to honor a Supreme Court decision from last year that weakened the federal government's ability to write strong regulations and fill in gaps in the law when those laws aren't clear. It was one of several blows to the EPA's regulatory authority in recent years \u2014 the justices also curtailed the EPA's power to write broad air and water protections.",
      "\u201cLaws are written by Congress and there are cases that have come out of the Supreme Court that provide the EPA with clear guidance on how we must do our job under the law,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Zeldin told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that Americans deserved safe water and clean air and promised to strike a more cooperative relationship with states \u2014 several Republican senators said they were tired of the Biden administration\u2019s heavy handed approach to enforcement.",
      "The League of Women voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin\u2019s lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy, manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin\u2019s record includes bright spots for environmentalists. He supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He\u2019s supported local conservation efforts, too.",
      "Soon after Trump picked Zeldin to run the agency, he was less reserved in his views, telling a Fox News interviewer that \u201cleft wing\u201d regulations hurt businesses.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest issues for so many Americans was the economy, and the president was talking about unleashing economic prosperity through the EPA,\u201d he said at the time.",

      "The arrest is one of several examples of state officials trying to restrain lawmakers or onlookers as legislative sessions begin in 2025.",
      "Burns banned Moore from the House chamber last year after Moore denounced late House Speaker David Ralston on a day when Ralston was being honored and his relatives were watching. In a speech, Moore called Ralston \u201cone of the most corrupt Georgia leaders we'll ever see\u201d over allegations that Ralston improperly delayed court cases he handled as a lawyer. Burns called Moore\u2019s remarks \u201cvile\u201d when he announced the ban, saying it would remain until Moore apologized.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re on the House floor, and you\u2019re expected to have decorum and respect for the institution,\u201d Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters. \u201cSame thing in the gallery.\u201d",
      "The stiffer rules mark another instance in the U.S. where state lawmakers are focusing on punishments when they find their peers are misbehaving. The topic returned to the forefront Thursday in Georgia, when state Sen. Colton Moore, who had been previously banned from the House chamber, was arrested after a shoving match with House employees where the right-wing Republican fell to the floor trying to enter the chamber for the governor's state of the state.",
      "Rowdy crowds have drawn attention in legislatures elsewhere, too. In Rhode Island, the public was blocked from entering the rotunda on Wednesday for hours for Democratic Gov. Dan McKee's state of the state speech, including protesters calling for action on homelessness, according to news reports.",
      "Tennessee House Republicans have been tinkering with the rules to dissuade disruption from political opponents since 2023. That's when they expelled two Democratic lawmakers for a protest on the floor calling for gun control after a deadly school shooting. The move backfired politically, putting Tennessee in the national spotlight and elevating the Democratic representatives' profile with huge fundraising hauls. Yet Republicans kept the same supermajority after November.",
      "Rep. Gloria Johnson, the Democrat who survived the expulsion votes, called the Tennessee House changes \u201cthe most ridiculous, fascist rules.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are sending members to \u2018time out\u2019 for being \u2018out of order,\u2019\u201d Johnson posted on social media Thursday. \u201cRemember that to them, if you mention the word racism, they will call you out of order.\u201d",
      "The changes come as Speaker Sexton has become a top target of criticism from left-leaning Capitol visitors. In pushing the changes, House Republicans noted that Congress has strict decorum rules for gallery visitors. While both Tennessee chambers are controlled by Republicans, the House has long attracted the most bombastic conflicts \u2014 both among lawmakers, but also from the gallery. The Senate has not changed its rules or aimed to quiet lawmakers or visitors.",
      "On a few occasions, audience outcry has stalled House action after a contentious bill passed, and state troopers were ordered to clear the stands. It's not uncommon for some to unfurl signs or shout profanities during particularly fiery debates.",
      "In response, Republicans have sought to silence protesters they deem too unruly. In 2023, they banned visitors from carrying signs inside the Capitol and in hearing rooms during a brief special session. The rule was later challenged in court and paused by a judge, but lawmakers adjourned before the case was settled. They haven't reinstituted the ban.",
      "Last year, House GOP officials made half the public gallery require tickets. Each of the 99 House members would get one ticket to give to someone each day of the House session. The ticketed side holds 128 seats. The other has 120 seats and remains first-come, first-serve.",
      "The new remote-voting penalty for lawmakers is largely tailored to one of the expelled-and-returned lawmakers. On numerous occasions, Republicans have ruled Rep. Justin Jones' comments out-of-order and voted to temporarily silence him previously, at times saying he's talking out of turn, speaking ill of another lawmaker or veering off-topic. Jones has said the House speaker at times has ignored his requests to speak. Jones has also claimed a double standard in which Republicans aren't punished for comparable behavior.",
      "Sexton likened the rule to one in Montana, where Republicans voted in 2023 to temporarily silence and banish Rep. Zooey Zephyr to remote voting. The transgender Democrat said colleagues supporting a ban on gender-affirming care for youths would have \u201cblood\u201d on their hands.",
      "Also under the new rules package, gallery visitors who try to get the attention of someone on the floor, or whose actions are deemed by the House speaker to be detrimental to proceedings, will be removed and banned from returning that day or the next legislative day. If someone shows \u201cespecially egregious conduct\u201d or is repeatedly kicked out, they could be banned longer, up to a full two-year legislative term.",
      "Lawmakers, meanwhile, could be removed from the House floor and forced to vote remotely after being ruled out of order enough times on multiple days.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein announced measures to protect reproductive health care providers and patients via a new executive order",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- North Carolina's Democratic Gov. Josh Stein unveiled new measures on Thursday that extend state protections for certain health care providers and patients' reproductive health data just a few days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Democratic governors \u2014 such as New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's recent decision to stockpile abortion medication within the state \u2014 are taking renewed action to curb possible anti-abortion measures under Trump's administration. Trump\u2019s stance on abortion was largely inconsistent on the campaign trail and it\u2019s unclear what action he will take after taking office next week.",
      "\u201cI don't know what will happen, but what I am trying to communicate to the people of this state is that they have a champion in me for their personal privacy and their right to make their own health care decisions,\u201d Stein said at a news conference.",
      "Under the executive order, state Cabinet agencies are ordered not to cooperate with prosecution and penalties against health care providers who provided legal reproductive health services, including abortion.",
      "State agencies also must review and revise how they store data related to a patient's reproductive health to \u201cmaximize protections for individual privacy,\" according to the executive order. The state's health and human services department is charged with ensuring access to legal birth control and reproductive health care medication in North Carolina.",
      "Stein's action builds off a previous executive order from former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in 2022 shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Cooper's order offered protections from extradition to out-of-state abortion patients and barred state agencies from aiding other states' investigations into abortion patients traveling to North Carolina.",
      "Stein's actions further cement yearslong efforts by Democratic governors to offer sanctuary to those seeking abortions across the country. North Carolina is one of the only states in the South that doesn't restrict abortion access to six weeks or below.",
      "The GOP-dominated state legislature passed and overrode Cooper's veto of a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks in 2023. A federal judge struck down part of the law last year that required physicians to document the \u201cintrauterine location of a pregnancy\u201d before distributing medication abortion.",
      "Any further legislation on abortion will have a tougher time making its way through the legislature after Republicans lost their House supermajority in the 2024 general election. That also means Stein's veto should be more effective than his predecessor's."

      "DENVER -- An incident involving an elevator at a former Colorado gold mine that led to the death of a tour guide and trapped a group of tourists for hours last year was caused by \u201coperator error,\u201d authorities said Wednesday.",
      "The Teller County Sheriff's Office did not provide details about what went wrong in a news release announcing the results of its investigation in the Oct. 10 death of Patrick Weier, 46, at the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine. However, investigators found there were no equipment malfunctions and that the mine met state regulations, the sheriff's office said in a news release.",
      "The incident happened as the elevator was descending into the mine in the mountains near Colorado Springs. At around 500 feet (152 meters) down, the person operating the elevator from the surface \u201cfelt something strange \" and stopped it, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell said at the time.",
      "The elevator was still operable, and those on board when the incident happened were brought back up within 20 minutes, he said. A door on the elevator was broken when it was raised.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the door malfunctioned or not or if something else occurred. There\u2019s a lot that goes on in these little elevators,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe just know that the door was broken somehow.\u201d",
      "Twelve adults from a second group were trapped at the bottom of the mine, 1,000 feet (305 meters) below ground, while engineers made sure the elevator could be used.",
      "Soon after the incident, Mikesell said Weier had died because of a problem with the elevator, not a medical problem.",
      "The case has been ruled an accident and has been closed, the sheriff\u2019s office said in its update. It did not explain what happened to Weier or how he died. He had a young child and was from the nearby town of Victor, Colorado.",
      "A spokesperson for the sheriff's office, Lt. Renee Bunting, declined to provide more details and told a reporter to file a records request to get more information.",
      "The mine, which was about to close for the season when the accident happened, will be able to reopen again for this year's tourist season, the sheriff's office said. State mining regulators had ordered the mine to remain closed and not conduct any tours until it could be determined whether the mine was in compliance with regulations.",
      "It is not known when the mine will reopen. The mine's website, which prominently features a photo of Weier and a link to a fundraiser for his son, still said it was closed indefinitely on Thursday and no one answered the telephone there."

      "On Oct. 28, about a week before Election Day, a ballot box in Portland, Oregon, and one in neighboring Vancouver, Washington state, were set on fire. The drop box fire in Vancouver \u2014 which was home to one of the most competitive U.S. House races in the country \u2014 damaged hundreds of ballots.",
      "A fire suppression system in the Portland drop box prevented most of the ballots from being scorched. Just three of the ballots inside were damaged.",
      "The ballot box in Vancouver also had a fire suppression system inside, but it failed to prevent hundreds of ballots from being damaged. Elections staff were able to identify nearly 500 damaged ballots retrieved from the box, according to the Clark County auditor\u2019s office.",
      "A previous drop box fire in Vancouver on Oct. 8 didn't damage any ballots. Vancouver, the biggest city in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, was the site of a competitive House race between Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, as she sought a second term, and Republican challenger Joe Kent.",
      "Authorities believe a male suspect that may have metalworking and welding experience was behind the three fires. They have described him as a white man, age 30 to 40, who is balding or has very short hair.",
      "The FBI has specifically asked for help identifying the suspect\u2019s car. Surveillance cameras captured images of a dark-colored, early 2003 to 2004 Volvo S-60 sedan, but at the time of the two most recent ballot box fires on Oct. 28 in Portland and Vancouver, it had a fraudulent temporary Washington license plate on the rear and no front plate, the bureau said.",
      "The Oct. 28 incendiary devices were marked with the message \u201cFree Gaza,\u201d according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation. A third device placed at a different drop box in Vancouver on Oct. 8 also carried the words \u201cFree Palestine\u201d in addition to \u201cFree Gaza,\u201d the official said.",
      "Authorities are trying to figure out whether the suspect actually had pro-Palestinian views or used the message to try to create confusion, the official said.",
      "The FBI has offered up to $25,000 as a reward for information about the suspect."

The United States appealed that decision, and the parties are awaiting a decision from a federal appeals court.",

The ATF rule expanded the category of people defined as \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of dealing firearms. It meant that an estimated 26,000 to 95,500 dealers would be required to get federally licensed and therefore be required to conduct background checks before sales. In May, 26 GOP attorneys general filed suits aiming to block the rule, arguing it violates the Second Amendment.",

      "Donald Trump has given voters a hefty list of promises, and many of them come due right away",
      "WASHINGTON -- After Donald Trump becomes president again on Monday, he is on the hook for achieving a hefty chunk of his promises even before the day is out. One of those promises is to make you dizzy.",
      "\u201cYour head will spin when you see what\u2019s going to happen,\" he said of Day 1.",
      "Steady yourself. This is some of what the Republican promised voters he would get done on his first day in office:",
      "\u2014 Launch the largest deportation in U.S. history to remove all people in the country illegally.",
      "\u2014 Close the border.",
      "\u2014 End automatic citizenship for everyone born in the U.S., known as birthright citizenship.",
      "\u2014 Sign pardons for some or many of those convicted or charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\u2014 Impose a 25% tariff on everything imported from Mexico and Canada and add a 10% tariff to duties already imposed on goods from China.",
      "\u2014 Even before Monday, end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "\u2014 End what he calls the \"electric vehicle mandate.\"",

      "\u2014 Cut federal money to schools that push \u201ccritical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the shoulders of our children.\u201d Also cut money to any schools that have a vaccine or mask mandate.",
      "\u2014 Take steps to uproot the \u201cdeep state.\u201d",
      "All of that on Monday?",
      "Not likely. Trump simply can't accomplish all he said he will do on Day 1 because there are two more branches of government \u2014 Congress and the courts. The constitutional right to birthright citizenship, for example, cannot be ended with a stroke of his pen. (Moreover, in 2017 he considered Jan. 21 \u2014 his first full day on the job after the Jan. 20 inauguration \u2014 to be his Day 1.)",
      "But as other presidents have done \u2014 and as Trump did aggressively and with decidedly mixed results in his first term \u2014 he will quickly test the limits of his executive power.",
      "The power to pardon is within his grasp, and he can steer border enforcement efforts, tweak tariffs and find ways to spur energy production without Congress necessarily having to pass a law. Yet many of his executive orders will essentially be statements of intent \u2014 stage setters for struggles to come.",
      "Here's a closer look at what he promised to do on Day 1:",
      "\u201cOn Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history.\u201d",
      "Under this core promise, Trump would unilaterally declare a national emergency to set the stage for tracking down millions of people in the United States illegally and holding them in huge detention centers until they can be removed from the country.",
      "Domestic police forces and the National Guard in some states could be empowered to help federal agents in an extraordinary effort to track down and deport millions of people. As a disincentive to cross into the U.S. illegally, it is untested. Illegal crossings surged during the Biden administration before dropping recently and hovering near a four-year low.",
      "Trump made this central promise in rally after rally and in other public comments. It's unclear whether the declaration of a national emergency would come as part of his Day 1 launch or after.",
      "\u201cThe day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. ... On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered.\u201d \u2014 Kinston, North Carolina, rally, Nov. 3, 2024.",
      "\u2014 Trump said in an interview with Time magazine that the federal prohibition on using military forces for most domestic security enforcement should not apply \u201cif it\u2019s an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country.\"",
      "\"And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help. We\u2019ll also get National Guard,\" he said during the November 2024 interview.",
      "\u2014 In a possible hedge to his vow to deport everyone who's in the U.S. illegally, Trump said, \u201cWe're starting with the criminals, and we\u2019ve got to do it. And then we\u2019re starting with others, and we\u2019re going to see how it goes.\u201d \u2014 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Dec. 8, 2024.",
      "The Dwight Eisenhower administration in the 1950s and Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s in the 1930s carried out mass deportations, specifically of Mexicans. Estimates of the number of people taken out of the U.S. in the 1950s deportation range from several hundred thousand to 1.3 million. Many were U.S. citizens descended from Mexican migrants. An FDR-era deportation ejected an estimated 1 million or more people, most of whom held U.S. citizenship.",
      "___",
      "Close the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cAnd on Day 1, I will close the border, and I will stop the invasion of illegal criminals coming into our country.\u201d \u2014 Coachella, California, rally, Oct. 12, 2024.",
      "Not serious about closing U.S. land borders, as promised. Instead, he aims to come forward with Day 1 administrative action tightening enforcement against criminal entry.",
      "Trump adviser Jason Miller walked it back: \"Now, when you say close the border, the impression is that nobody\u2019s allowed to go back and forth. What the border will be closed to is for people trying to enter the United States illegally. So there\u2019s a distinction. I want to make sure people don\u2019t think that all of a sudden, like all trade between the countries or traditional commerce or it\u2019s going to be shut down.\u201d \u2014 Interview with NPR News, Dec. 17, 2024.",

      "This is a broken promise waiting to happen.",
      "Trump is extremely unlikely to be able to achieve his promise by mere executive order, because birthright citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution. He could only embark on a daunting quest to build the support that would be needed not just to win congressional approval but to change the 14th Amendment, which states: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",

      "A seismic shock to the highly integrated North American economies, almost certainly resulting in higher prices for consumers and probably retaliation against U.S. exports. It would also strengthen incentives to produce more in the U.S. and step up pressure to restrain migrant flows and drug smuggling.",
      "Serious in general terms, maybe not in the specifics here.",
      "Trump clearly supports raising tariffs to induce more domestic manufacturing. But his threat could be a bargaining chip in part. The size and scope of the tariffs may change, depending how the three countries respond before he takes office.",
      "He has tied this heavy round of tariffs to what he calls the failure of these countries to stem the flow of Chinese-made fentanyl smuggled into the U.S. or to take effective steps from their side against migration surges at the borders. That stance may leave room for negotiation or revision.",
      "\u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States.\u201d In addition, \u201cwe will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States\" until China stems the flow of drugs into the U.S. \u2014 Truth Social posts, Nov. 25, 2024.",

      "Trump imposed higher tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese goods in his first term. Democrat Joe Biden not only retained those penalties as president but imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.

      "Such broad cuts are unlikely to be achieved through executive action, absent legislation, which certainly won't be in place on his first day. Still, Trump may be able to use his threat as a cudgel in certain situations.",

But he is likely to try to loosen Biden-era tailpipe pollution and fuel economy standards that are an incentive for automakers to sell and consumers to buy more EVs. It's also unclear whether Trump intends to revoke a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying a new EV.",

      "The Justice Department is rescinding its protocol for federal executions that allowed for single-drug lethal injections with pentobarbital",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is rescinding its protocol for federal executions that allowed for single-drug lethal injections with pentobarbital, after a government review raised concerns about the potential for \u201cunnecessary pain and suffering.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland's order to withdraw the lethal injection policy comes days before President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to restart federal executions, is set to return to the White House. Trump\u2019s Justice Department could reinstate the protocol to use pentobarbital as a single drug to carry out executions.",
      "A moratorium on federal executions has been in place since 2021, and only three defendants remain on federal death row after Democratic President Joe Biden converted 37 of their sentences to life in prison.",
      "The governments\u2019 findings about the potential risks of unnecessary pain could have broader implications. Legal challenges have been brought in several states where pentobarbital is the primary method of execution, potentially leading to reviews of execution protocols nationwide.",
      "The department's review of scientific and medical research found there remains \u201csignificant uncertainty about whether the use of pentobarbital as a single drug lethal injection causes unnecessary pain and suffering,\" according to a report published Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIn the face of such uncertainty, the Department should err on the side of treating individuals humanely and avoiding unnecessary pain and suffering,\u201d Garland wrote in his memo ordering the director of the Bureau of Prisons to rescind the protocol. Garland said it should not be reinstated \u201dunless and until that uncertainty is resolved.\"",
      "The report from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy noted that the Food and Drug Administration \"has not reviewed or approved of the use of pentobarbital in high doses or for the purpose of causing death.\u201d",
      "The pentobarbital protocol was adopted by Bill Barr, attorney general during Trump's first term, to replace a three-drug mix used in the 2000s, the last time federal executions were carried out before Trump was in office. The Trump administration carried out 13 federal executions, more than under any president in modern history.",
      "Under Trump, the Justice Department also sanitized the accounts of the executions carried out in 2020 and 2021. Government lawyers said the process of dying by lethal injection was like falling asleep and they called gurneys \u201cbeds\u201d and final breaths \u201csnores.\u201d But accounts by reporters from The Associated Press and other media witnesses described how prisoners\u2019 stomachs rolled, shook and shuddered as the pentobarbital took effect during executions at the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. The AP witnessed every federal execution.",
      "Questions about whether inmates\u2019 midsections trembled, as media witnesses reported, were a focus of litigation throughout the series of executions. Inmates\u2019 lawyers argued it proved pentobarbital caused flash pulmonary edema, in which fluid rushes through quickly disintegrating membranes into lungs and airways, causing pain akin to being suffocated or drowned. The Constitution prohibits execution methods that are \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d",
      "Several states also have policies allowing single-drug executions with pentobarbital. Tennessee announced last month that it would use the single drug to carry out executions that have been halted since 2022. The state's previous protocol called for three different drugs to be used in a series.",
      "Shawn Nolan, a lawyer who has represented federal death row inmates, said in a statement that the report makes clear that \u201cno jurisdiction, federal or state, should continue using this cruel, unconstitutional execution method.\u201d",
      "The chief of the federal public defender\u2019s habeas unit in Nashville, Tennessee, Kelley Henry, said the review was \u201ca damning condemnation of the use of pentobarbital to poison prisoners to death\u201d and that Tennessee \"should rescind its execution protocol immediately.\u201d",
      "Biden's decision commute the sentences of most death row inmates spared the lives of people convicted in killings, including those of police and military officers, people on federal land and those involved in deadly bank robberies or drug deals, as well as the killings of guards or prisoners in federal facilities.",
      "The decision leaves three federal inmates to face execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history.",

      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken has defended Biden administration policies on Israel's war with Hamas after a ceasefire agreement in Gaza was reached",
      "WASHINGTON -- Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday defended Biden administration policies on Israel\u2019s war with Hamas after a ceasefire agreement in Gaza was reached, facing protests that interrupted his final news conference at the State Department.",
      "He said he expected the deal \u2014 announced by President Joe Biden and Qatar on Wednesday \u2014 to be implemented over the weekend. He called it \u201ca moment of historic possibility for the region and well beyond\u201d even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a last-minute dispute with Hamas was holding up Israeli approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take tremendous effort, political courage, compromise to realize that possibility, to try to ensure that the gains that have been achieved over the past 15 months at enormous, excruciating cost are actually enduring,\u201d Blinken said.",
      "As he touted the deal, two people in the room accused him of complicity in Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians in loud outbursts that forced him to pause. One shouted, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in the Hague?\u201d referring to the International Criminal Court based in the Dutch city, and the other called him \u201ca monster.\u201d",
      "Blinken asked them to \u201crespect the process.\u201d Both men were physically removed by Diplomatic Security officers.",
      "While protests are common in large public gatherings, including just this week when Blinken delivered an address on the Middle East at a Washington-based think tank, they are rare, if not unprecedented, in the State Department briefing room.",
      "After recovering from the interruptions, Blinken said in response to other questions that the U.S. has had \u201creal differences\u201d with Israel in how it has gone about defending its people and has \u201cexpressed those clearly at various points.\u201d",
      "But \u201cwe\u2019ve mostly done it privately, precisely because we didn\u2019t want to feed into Hamas\u2019 clearly held views that if that pressure was mounting, and if there was daylight, they could do nothing,\u201d Blinken said. That \u201cthey could refuse to engage on the negotiations, hold back on a ceasefire and releasing the hostages, and thus perpetuate the suffering, the loss for the people that they purport to represent.\u201d",
      "Blinken and other members of the Biden administration have faced severe criticism for not imposing meaningful restrictions on the supply of weapons to Israel or pushing its key ally hard enough to ease a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.",
      "Israel's military offensive against Hamas militants \u2014 who triggered the war with their Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attacks that killed some 1,200 people \u2014 has leveled vast swaths of Gaza and pushed around 90% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are struggling with hunger and disease in squalid tent camps on the coast.",
      "The campaign has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.",
      "Blinken said the administration was acutely aware of the civilian suffering in Gaza, but said it had stopped short of accusing Israel of war crimes because of the \u201cuniquely challenging situation\u201d in the territory.",
      "\u201cUniquely in Gaza, besides having a population that\u2019s been trapped there that has nowhere else to go, you have an enemy that embeds itself in and amongst civilians, houses, hospitals, mosques, schools, and getting a clear picture and a clear understanding of whether any one incident in that context constitutes a violation of international law \u2014 it's an incredibly complicated thing to do, especially to do it in real time,\" he said.",
      "Blinken traveled to the Mideast 12 times in a bid to halt the fighting. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump are both claiming credit for the ceasefire deal after the White House brought Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy into the stalled negotiations.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden in his Wednesday farewell speech to the nation warned that American democracy was sliding into an \u201coligarchy\u201d of tech billionaires. But what exactly is an oligarchy?",
      "In short, an oligarchy is an elite few who control the government's actions.",
      "By using the pointedly negative term \u201coligarchy,\u201d Biden equated this moment \u2014 when the world's wealthiest men are feting President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 with some of history's more brutal regimes.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to cohost a Trump inaugural reception with wealthy Republican donors next week. Amazon Prime Video, which was founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, got exclusive licensing rights to stream and theatrically release first lady Melania Trump 's new documentary.",
      "Meta, Amazon and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. And billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s super PAC spent around $200 million to help elect Trump.",
      "But Biden made a complicated assertion as both Republicans and Democrats have relied on Silicon Valley fortunes to boost their political ambitions.",
      "Like many words in politics, oligarchy originates from Ancient Greek and quite literally means that few command. But unlike an aristocracy, an oligarchy is more closely tied to wealth than nobility and family lineage.",
      "The philosopher Aristotle wrote in his book \u201cPolitics\u201d that \u201cdemocracy is safer and more free from civil strife than oligarchy; for in oligarchies two kinds of strife spring up, faction between different members of the oligarchy and also faction between the oligarchs and the people.\u201d",
      "Multiple countries have been labeled oligarchies by academics. After the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, former state assets and other institutions came under the control of increasingly wealthy businessmen who became known as billionaire oligarchs.",
      "The mix of profits and politics that began under then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave way to crackdowns by President Vladimir Putin, who has his own favored oligarchs and pledged to let them keep their fortunes so long as they are loyal to him.",
      "With its legacy of colonialism and powerful families, the Philippines has been accused of being an oligarchy, with its former President Rodrigo Duterte claiming to have dismantled the system. Critics said he simply gave preferences to a different set of oligarchs.",
      "Apartheid-era South Africa was also seen by some academics as having a white racial oligarchy.",
      "Even before Biden's speech, the rising wealth gap in the United States \u2014 as well as in China \u2014 raised concerns about whether the world's two largest economies were becoming oligarchies.",
      "Associated Press writers Lindsey Bahr and Dan Merica contributed reporting."

      "But a Treasury spokesperson said the Budgetary measures were to \"wipe the slate clean\" and deliver stability to businesses.",
      "In last October's Budget, the government increased the rate of National Insurance (NI) paid by employers from April, and also reduced the threshold that employers start paying it at from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000.",

      "Next made over a billion pounds in profit last year, while other big retailers with large workforces - like Tesco and Sainsbury's also made bumper profits. Lord Wolfson accepts that they are the \"broad shoulders\" that the chancellor insisted must bear the brunt of tax rises needed to rebuild public services.",
      "\"Government did need to raise taxes. I've got nothing against lowering the threshold for NI in principle but the speed at which it is going to happen, the lack of consultation, that is the problem.\"",
      "Lord Wolfson also has concerns about a new workers' rights bill.",
      "This promises to give greater protection from unfair dismissal and \"exploitative\" zero-hours contracts, with employees able to request a guaranteed hours contract based on hours worked over a period. But that could pose a problem for retailers.",

      "\"Over the last five years the government has employed 100,000 more civil servants.",

      "It is a rate the world can \"live with\" according to the bank's deputy chief economist Ayhan Kose, but would not be enough to improve people's living standards in both richer and poorer countries.",
      "He warned trade tariffs, which President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to introduce on imports to the US, could have worldwide economic consequences.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",

    "summary": "AI can take a second look at medical scans and flag up potential problems that doctors might not see.",
    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Winconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham and Southampton. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

      "The head of the country's statistics bureau said China's economic achievements in 2024 were \"hard won,\" after the government launched a slew of stimulus measures late last year.",
      "Beijing has rarely missed its growth targets in the past.",
      "Experts had broadly predicted this rate of growth. The World Bank said lower borrowing costs and rising exports would mean China could achieve annual growth of 4.9%.",
      "Investors, however, are bracing themselves: the threat of President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs on $500bn (\u00a3409bn) worth of Chinese goods looms large.",
      "Yet that is not all that stands in the way of China achieving its growth targets next year.",
      "Business and consumer confidence is low, and the Chinese yuan will continue to weaken as Beijing cuts interest rates in a bid to boost growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why Xi has bigger challenges than Trump's tariffs:",
      "1. Tariffs are already hurting Chinese exports",
      "There is a growing chorus of warnings that China's economy will slow in 2025. One major driving factor of last year's growth is now at risk: exports.",
      "China has relied on manufacturing to help exit the slowdown - so, it has been exporting a record number of electric vehicles, 3D printers and industrial robots.",
      "The US, Canada and the European Union have accused China of making too many goods and imposed tariffs on Chinese imports to protect domestic jobs and businesses.",
      "Experts say Chinese exporters may now focus on other parts of the world. But those countries are likely to be in emerging markets, which don't have the same levels of demand as North America and Europe.",
      "That could impact Chinese businesses that are hoping to expand, in turn hitting suppliers of energy and raw materials.",
      "Xi wants to transform China from the world's factory for cheap goods into a high-tech powerhouse by 2035 but it's unclear how manufacturing can continue to be such a big growth driver in the face of rising tariffs.",
      "2. People are just not spending enough",
      "In China, household wealth is largely invested in the property market. Before the real estate crisis, it accounted for almost a third of China's economy - employing millions of people, from builders and developers to cement producers and interior designers.",
      "Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms.",
      "But there are still too many empty homes and commercial properties, and that oversupply continues to force down prices.",
      "The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a \"multi-year drag\" on China's economic growth.",
      "It's already hit spending hard - in the last three months of 2024, household consumption contributed just 29% to China's economic activity, down from 59% before the pandemic.",
      "That is one of the reasons Beijing has stepped up exports. It wants to help offset sluggish domestic spending on new cars, luxury items and almost everything else.",
      "The government has even introduced programmes like consumer goods trade-ins, where people can exchange their washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers.",
      "But experts wonder whether these kinds of measures alone are sufficient without addressing deeper issues in the economy.",
      "They say people will need more money in their pockets before pre-Covid levels for spending return.",
      "\"China needs to bring back the animal spirit of the population and we are still far from that,\" said Shuang Ding, Chief Economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.",
      "\"If the private sector starts to invest and innovate that could increase income and the job outlook, and people will have more confidence to consume.\"",
      "Steep public debt and unemployment have also affected savings and spending.",
      "Official figures suggest the youth jobless rate remains high compared to before the pandemic, and that wage rises have stalled.",
      "3. Businesses are not flocking to China like they used to",
      "President Xi has promised to invest in the cutting-edge industries that the government calls \"new productive forces\".",
      "Until now, that has helped China become a leader in goods like renewable energy products such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries.",
      "Last year, China also overtook Japan as the world's biggest car exporter.",
      "But the lacklustre economic picture, uncertainty over tariffs and other geopolitical uncertainties mean the appetite of foreign businesses for investment in China is subdued.",
      "It's not about foreign or domestic investment - it's that businesses don't see a bright future, said Stephanie Leung from wealth management platform StashAway.",
      "\"They would like to see a more diversified set of investors coming in.\"",
      "For all of these reasons, experts believe the measures to support the economy will only partially alleviate the impact of potential new US tariffs.",
      "Beijing must either undertake big, bold measures or accept that the economy is not going to grow so fast, Goldman Sachs' Chief China Economist Hui Shan wrote in a recent report, adding: \"We expect them to choose the former.\"",
      "\"China needs to stabilise property markets and create sufficient jobs to ensure social stability,\" Mr Ding from Standard Chartered Bank said.",
      "According to researcher China Dissent Monitor, there were more than 900 protests in China between June and September 2024 led by workers and property owners - 27% more than the same period a year earlier.",
      "These sort of social strains as a result of economic grievances and an erosion of wealth will be a concern for the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "After all, explosive growth turned China into a global power, and the promise of increased prosperity has largely helped its leaders keep a tight lid on dissent."

    "summary": "The marginal dip in UK inflation is unusually important and offers some respite to the chancellor.",
    "story": [
      "A marginal dip in the headline rate of inflation would not normally determine much, if anything.",
      "Inflation rising at 2.5% rather than 2.6% does not change much in big economics, nor in the cost of living squeeze felt by households. The fall is entirely accounted for by falls in hotel prices and a smaller-than-usual rise in airfares in December.",
      "But this unusually important 0.1% drop signals relief, and some respite for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, because of what underpins it.",
      "The underlying inflation numbers, which show where price pressures are going over the year, are what is most keenly watched by the Bank of England in terms of interest rate cuts.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out the direct impact of volatile energy and food prices is now at a four-year low, having dropped to 3.2% in December from 3.5%. Services inflation is at a two-year low of 4.4% after a chunky fall from 5%. This is the real positive news.",
      "For the real nerds, inflation in supply chains, including in services, also indicates muted inflationary pressures.",
      "So the inflationary picture in the UK can be cast in a rather different light. While no-one can predict exactly how the Bank of England will react, it clears away objections to an interest rate cut next month. The markets scrambled this morning to keep up, now back forecasting further rate cuts after February this year.",
      "UK inflation unexpectedly dips to 2.5% in December",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "However, there are two big uncertainties \u2013 whether President-elect Trump will bring in tariffs at the scale he has threatened, and how companies in the UK react to the forthcoming increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) in April and the rise in the minimum wage. A rise in energy prices which will hit bills is also predicted for April.",
      "Both tariffs and the forthcoming changes to NICs and the minimum wage may not end up being as problematic for the UK economy as some are warning.",
      "While some are expecting firms to raise prices as a result of the Budget changes, some companies may also choose to squeeze wages with lower-than-expected annual wage increases. The overall inflationary impact depends on how firms react and the truth is we don't know yet.",
      "Similarly Trump's tariffs are likely to be inflationary for the US and therefore affect US interest rates. But some at the Bank of England can see a scenario where cheaper tariff imports, for example from China, are diverted to the UK helping to rein in UK inflation.",
      "What actually happens is again uncertain but the outcome may be counterintuitive to what people expect.",
      "So the marginal fall in UK inflation can be seen as something of a firebreak, for now, popping something of the frothy hysteria seen over the past few weeks. Those shorting the UK on international markets will see that there is another side to this bet. UK inflation is in the middle of the G7 pack.",
      "That said, what has been called a global \"bond market tantrum\" remains in place, sensitive to every new piece of data. The UK government still has to convince on the detail of growth plans. It will mean fast-tracking infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies.",
      "Market borrowing rates remain at levels where the chancellor will probably need to course-correct spending plans with new cuts before Easter, in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "The shadow cast over inflationary prospects and so all markets by Donald Trump's unconventional trade policies looms large.",
      "The turbulence has not gone away. Inflation is likely to tick up again in the coming months. But right now headline and underlying inflation numbers in the UK all point in the right direction. It is a welcome safe harbour for now, but the seas remain choppy."

      "\"Are there going to be some tax breaks for certain industries? I think specifics and action is what the market wants to see,\" she said.",
      "Rising borrowing costs have a knock-on effect on the government's tax and spending plans, because it will have to pay more interest to finance its existing debt. That leaves less to spend on public services and investment.",

      "Inflation, the rate of price increases, has come down significantly in the US since 2022, when it shot past 9%.",
      "Investors had expected the Federal Reserve, which had hiked rates to the highest levels in more than two decades to fight the problem, to cut rates this year as a result.",
      "But the Fed is less likely to cut interest rates if the economy is growing. As such, last month's stronger-than-expected job creation figures raised doubts about how much US interest rates might fall in the months ahead.",
      "Investors are also nervous that plans by President-elect Donald Trump for tariffs, mass migrant deportations, and tax cuts could put upward pressure on prices. If this did drive inflation, it too would make Fed rate cuts less likely.",

      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",
      "It's a cold, grey, windy day in southern Guatemala as Sanda proudly shows off the plot of land she rents in a place called Las Tres Cruces, high up in the hills near a town where she lives with her family, called Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez.",
      "She and her relatives grow corn, lettuce, beans and spinach for them to eat. And if there's enough left over they sell them at the local market.  Sandra's dream is to save enough money to buy some land, so they don't have to rent.",
      "But first she needs to pay off the rest of the debt that she got herself in to after being scammed when she and her sister first tried to get a visa for the United States.",
      "\"We paid someone $2,000 per person because we wanted to get work in the US,\" she says. \"My sister and I thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true. So, we got a loan to get the money, but sadly it was all a scam, and they took our money.\"",
      "This is common practice for fraudsters in Guatemala, who play with people's desperation to get to the US, and trick them into handing over money.",
      "Cesia Ochoa is the executive director for the Guatemala branch of a legitimate recruitment company called Cierto. A business that also has offices in the US and Mexico, it is one of the 30 or so officially registered in Guatemala to offer H-2A visas.",
      "\"Part of our inspiration for opening an office in Guatemala was to help locals avoid the scams,\" she says.",
      "When Sandra went to the US via Cierto, she didn't have to pay it a fee. Instead, the company is paid by farm businesses in the US looking for temporary workers.",
      "Ms Ochoa explains: \"For us, it's really important that we make a good contact between businesses and the workers, and that the salaries and contract they are offering are real.\"",
      "While the H-2A visa allows people from Guatemala to legally find temporary farm work in the US, there is estimated to be more than 675,000 undocumented Guatemalans in the US, according to the Pew Research Center think tank.",
      "And a further 200,000 were found to have tried to enter the US without valid documentation in the 12 months to September of last year. That is the third highest number behind Mexicans and Venezuelans.",
      "How many migrants have crossed the US border illegally?",

      "Olga Romero lives near a town called Olopa in the north-east of Guatemala. She has seven children, two of whom are working in the US without any visas.",
      "\"This is a poor region where work is hard to find, and families often pay someone called a coyote between $2,000 and $3,000 to take them to the US illegally,\" says Olga.",
      "A big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home. They can then lose their properties if the money isn't paid back.",
      "And that is often the case, given that the chance of them making it to the US is far from guaranteed, with the risk of accidents along the way, or being turned back at the US border.",
      "But the rewards are high. The money loved ones send back from the US is known as remittances, and these are propping up Guatemala's economy. In 2023 the country received $19.8bn in total remittances from abroad, according to one study from the Inter-American Development Bank.",
      "President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough on undocumented immigrants, and is threatening to carry out mass deportations .",
      "But it is not yet clear if he will make moves to limit, or even stop, H-2A and the other visa schemes for temporary foreign workers.",
      "Vanessa Garc\u00eda, executive director of recruitment organisation Juan Francisco Garcia Comparini Foundation, is optimistic that such visas will continue.",
      "The foundation helps send around 200 Guatemalans a year to work in the US with H-2A visas. These are farm labourers who help to harvest lettuces, cauliflowers, spinach and beans.",
      "\"I think that the opportunities for Guatemalans to get an H-2A visa will continue and perhaps even grow,\" she says. \"I am not worried, and I think this is a great opportunity for workers.\"",
      "Joe Martinez, the US-based founder and CEO of Cierto, says that while he expects the visa scheme to continue under Trump, rights for the foreign workers might be weakened.",
      "\"Cierto is concerned that the push to streamline and reduce bureaucratic processes could lead to a program with less worker protections and less oversight.\"",
      "He is worried that wages could fall for the farmworkers, and that their housing conditions on US farms may worsen.",
      "Back in Guatemala, H\u00e9ctor Benjam\u00edn Xoc Xar, says he has done two working trips to the US via the H-2A visa. The most recent one saw him working in a greenhouse growing vegetables. He says his inspiration is his family.",
      "\"I want them to do better than me academically,\" he says. \"I left school when I was still young to work in the fields.",
      "\"Before I got this work it looked like my daughter wasn't going to be able to finish her final year studying accountancy because we couldn't afford it, but now I've managed to pay for her and she's working as an accountant.\""

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The Nordic nation doesn't require staff to work long hours and has a generous welfare system.",
    "story": [
      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid vacation per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

    "summary": "Labour paused implementation of the act after taking power, due to concerns over student welfare.",
    "story": [
      "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.",
      "The Higher Education Freedom of Speech Act, which proposed fines for universities failing to uphold freedom of speech, was passed under the previous, Conservative government in 2023.",
      "But its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.",
      "The act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.",
      "It included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.",
      "A new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers was also included. They could seek compensation if they suffered from a breach of a university's free-speech obligations.",
      "However, last July the education secretary paused the law days before it was due to come into force, over fears it could protect people using hate speech on campuses and expose universities to expensive legal action.",
      "At the time, a government source told the BBC the legislation would have opened the way for Holocaust deniers to be allowed on campus, and was an \"antisemite charter\".",
      "Phillipson told Parliament in July that the delay would allow time to consider whether the law would be repealed.",
      "Having spent the last six months considering what to do, the act is now being brought back.",
      "Issuing fines",
      "In a statement, Phillipson said academic freedom was \"much more important than the wishes of some students not to be offended\".",
      "However, the government says it will seek to remove the part of the act that allows people to sue universities that fail to uphold their duty to protect freedom of speech.",
      "It could result in long and costly legal battles, at a time when many universities were already struggling financially, the government said.",
      "There will also no longer be direct responsibility on student unions under the law, though Phillipson said they would still be expected to support free speech and held to account by their university.",
      "The National Union of Students welcomed the announcement, saying the threat of complex legal responsibilities was no longer hanging over them.",
      "The OfS would retain powers to investigate alleged breaches of free speech under the law, the government said, as well as issuing fines.",
      "Shadow education secretary Laura Trott described the changes as a \"wrecking ball\" to the policy, and questioned what the consequences would be for universities alleged to have breached their free speech duties with the threat of legal action removed.",
      "'Inciting violence'",
      "But the government said it would provide a workable version of the act that would protect minority groups while defending freedom of speech on campuses.",
      "The Union of Jewish Students (UJS) welcomed the revised act, saying it \"takes into account the concerns raised by UJS and other parties\".",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day that academic freedom and freedom of speech were \"essential\" to universities and she was glad the legislation was coming back.",
      "But some of the original provisions in the act would \"gum up the works like you wouldn't believe\" for universities, she said.",
      "When the legislation was originally introduced, then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would allow speakers to \"articulate views which others may disagree with as long as they don't meet the threshold of hate speech or inciting violence\".",
      "'Toothless tiger'",
      "Protests have taken place on university campuses in recent years, including before a talk by gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock at Oxford.",
      "There have also been cases of individuals being \"no-platformed\", where a controversial speaker is banned from an event.",
      "The education secretary said there had been too many such examples of freedom of speech not being upheld at universities and \"unacceptable\" cases like that of Prof Jo Phoenix, who was found by an employment tribunal to have been discriminated against and harassed at work because of her gender-critical beliefs.",
      "But Prof Phoenix told BBC News the revised version of the act was like a \"toothless tiger\" and the suppression of free speech still posed a \"real and visceral threat to the robustness of our universities\".",

      "\"Parents have lost confidence and councils are increasingly being pushed to the brink,\" she said.",
      "Most Send children, who require more educational support than their peers, are taught in mainstream schools.",
      "Those with further needs can get legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).",
      "The report from the PAC, which scrutinises public spending, said there were 576,000 children with an EHCP in January 2024.",
      "One of them is Rachel Morgan's seven-year-old son Max, who has autism and ADHD.",
      "Mum Rachel, from Birmingham, said Max missed much of his schooling during a \"never-ending battle\" to get support for him, but that he was now \"brimming with confidence\" in a specialist school.",
      "Despite that, the lack of specialist places means the school is a 45-minute journey away.",

      "It also found many councils failed to provide EHCPs for children who need them within the 20-week timeframe required by law.",

      "Current \"piecemeal interventions\" were doing nothing to improve the sustainability of the system, which was in urgent need of reform, the report said.",
      "Councillor Arooj Shah, from the Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, called for councils' spending deficits on Send to be \"written off\".",
      "Phillipson told the education committee she \"recognised the urgency\" to provide more information for councils setting their budgets for next year, adding that the government would set out more on their plans around Send deficits as soon as possible.",
      "'Culture of belonging'",
      "One of the report's recommendations to government was to explain how mainstream schools can be more inclusive for Send pupils.",

      "New Mario Kart?",
      "No price or release date was revealed, but the company will release further details during a showcase on 2 April.",
      "The company also repeated one of the few pieces of official information known prior to the reveal - that the new console will be backwards-compatible.",

      "Sales of the Switch marked a massive turnaround in Nintendo's hardware fortunes.",
      "The Wii U - its follow-up to the enormously successful Wii - was widely seen as a flop, and some analysts even predicted the company could follow former rival Sega into becoming a software publisher at the time.",
      "But the Switch's hybrid mechanic clicked with gamers.",
      "Although the console was less powerful than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Nintendo produced a number of \"must-have\" games in-house, including new entries in the Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises.",
      "And, like other games companies, it got a boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, with cosy, escapist life sim Animal Crossing: New Horizons proving a runaway hit.",
      "Is Switch 2 a guaranteed hit?",
      "Nintendo suffered from \"second album syndrome\" with the 2012 Wii U, where its smash hit console was followed by a comparative failure.",
      "BBC Newsbeat previously spoke to George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter about his predictions for the Switch 2.",
      "He said plenty of keen gamers would rush out to buy the console as soon as it launched.",
      "But, he said: \"Nintendo has managed to establish a very strong audience of families buying consoles.\"",
      "If the Switch 2 wasn't seen as a significant technological step up, George said, the challenge will be convincing the more casual audience to upgrade from the original.",
      "\"I think there'll be a lot of families who are going, 'Well, I'm perfectly happy with this family device, it serves my needs, I can keep up on this,\" he said.",

      "Valve, owner of the huge PC game Steam store, has sold millions of its \"handheld PC\" Steam Deck, and Sony and Microsoft are also reported to be looking into releasing portable gaming devices.",
      "Analyst George says there is more competition for the core gaming audience than there was in 2017.",
      "\"So there is that question about whether the Switch 2 can be enough of a step up to convince people who've maybe dipped into a Steam Deck as well to go, 'yes, I want to buy a Switch 2 to go alongside it',\" said George.",
      "Matching the sales of the original Switch will be a tall order, but it's fairly safe to assume demand will be high when it's released.",
      "The launches of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles - during a global microchip shortage - were marred by scalpers hoovering up the few consoles that were available.",

      "The 64-year-old was accused on Monday of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out.",
      "On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\".",

      "The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleged that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her.",

    "summary": "Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan have been announced as the three new presenters of the show.",
    "story": [
      "After 60 years, Match of the Day is abandoning its sole presenter format and taking on three people who will, in turn, host the show. It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.",
      "Match of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.",
      "His replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.",
      "Lineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "There was speculation that footballer-turned-broadcaster Alex Scott would take over the show - but in the end, the names in the press release are all stalwarts of decades of live broadcasting.",
      "The person who might be less familiar to the BBC TV audience is Kelly Cates. But the daughter of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has 26 years' experience of live TV and radio on Sky and 5 Live. She knows football and she knows television.",
      "Likewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.",
      "By choosing three new hosts, the BBC is following a pattern in TV where a brand or format becomes less associated with a single name.",
      "When Richard Osman decided to leave Pointless, six people were named as his replacements for the daily show (and another eight for the series after that).",
      "Angus Deayton's presenting role on Have I Got News For You became an ever-changing roster of weekly visitors to the presenting chair.",
      "The One Show may have a core of four main presenters, but the list of people who have over the years done a stint on the green sofa is a long one.",
      "Match of the Day has now been handed over to some very safe hands.",
      "And based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.",
      "There is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.",
      "In an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.",
      "However, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.",
      "The resilience of Match of the Day has not gone unnoticed, and with the current rights deal due to continue until the 2028/29 season, this is a brand the BBC hopes to grow.",
      "There have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.",
      "Given that the BBC has struggled to compete in an era of rapidly escalating costs for sports rights, it dearly wants to hang on to an audience that may not consume at lot of the rest of the BBC's output.",
      "There is also a good reason the Premier League wants the highlights programme to succeed - about half of the league's domestic TV audience see their football only on the BBC.",

      "Linda Nolan and her singing sisters lived in the spotlight after their career-defining hit I'm In The Mood For Dancing in 1979 - meaning both their highs and lows were played out in public.",
      "The close-knit group, the original sisters - Linda, Anne, Denise, Maureen and Bernie (Coleen was initially too young) - had been on the music scene since 1974 and went on to become one of the biggest British groups of the late 70s and early 80s.",
      "The Nolans scored seven UK top 20 hits, including their most famous song, which reached number three in 1980.",
      "They also built up a big international following - particularly in Japan. And they went on tour with Frank Sinatra.",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "All this came with a sugary disco image and catchy bubblegum songs, also including Spirit, Body and Soul, Don't Make Waves and Don't Love Me Too Hard.",
      "\"For all its formulaic superficial corniness, I'm In The Mood For Dancing is a definite uplifting shiny-minded pop song,\" music journalist Paul Morley told BBC News.",
      "\"[It was] efficiently custom built for parties, Top of the Pops and weddings, and with a longevity you would not have seen coming at the time.\"",
      "'Importance of hard work'",
      "After some line-up changes, Linda left the group in 1983 to pursue a solo career, mainly in musical theatre - and with a good degree of success.",
      "Her most memorable role was in the West End production of Blood Brothers. Then there were regular TV appearances, including a notorious turn on 2014's Celebrity Big Brother, where she came face-to-face with her long-time adversary, comedian Jim Davidson.",
      "But, as the years went on, showbusiness seemed to be overshadowed for Linda and her siblings by a personal and family life marked by turmoil, tragedy and the breakdown of sisterly bonds.",
      "Linda was born in Ireland before her parents Tommy and Maureen Nolan, a husband-and-wife singing duo, moved the family to Blackpool in 1962 in search of work. There were eight Nolan offspring - six girls and two boys. All the girls sang and were performing from an early age.",
      "The Nolan girls found themselves on a treadmill of performances in nightclubs, on TV and on tours. Their fees paid the family bills.",
      "Their father doubled as their manager and would wait in the bar before taking them home in the early hours of a school day.",
      "\"The importance of hard work was drummed into us at an early age,\" Linda told The Telegraph in 2018. \"My attitude has always been that unless I'm on a stretcher, the show must go on.\"",
      "But, as it emerged much later, their father, an alcoholic and womaniser, was sexually abusing his eldest daughter, Anne. He was frequently violent, too. Tommy Nolan died aged 78 in 1998. Anne unloaded her secret in her 2008 autobiography.",
      "\"It must have been difficult for Anne all those years because everybody loved our father, absolutely loved him,\" Linda said in an interview with The Guardian.",
      "\"She must have been seething. People say it was probably cathartic for her to write the book, and I'm sure it was.\"",
      "The girls were \"spotted\" at a Blackpool gig in 1973 and signed a recording contract, but their big break came in 1978 when they got a deal with Epic Sony-CBS.",
      "So began the hits, world tours and regular appearances on TV shows from Top of the Pops to Morecambe and Wise.",
      "The Nolans sold 25 million albums globally but very little of the profits ended up in the girls' pockets, their father having failed to appreciate he could negotiate a bigger pay deal.",
      "In 1979, Linda met Brian Hudson, a former musician, and they married in 1981 despite the reservations of her parents over the 13-year age gap and Brian's history of two divorces. Brian also became The Nolans' tour manager.",
      "\"But when the other girls decided that my husband Brian wasn't right as their tour manager, I was devastated and opted to launch a solo career instead,\" Linda told The Telegraph later.",
      "She left with a cheque for \u00a313,000 - but then a tax bill came in for the same amount.",
      "Linda's solo career, managed by Brian, first saw her make guest appearances on TV and on the tours of such diverse names as Gene Pitney and Cannon and Ball.",
      "She also did her fair share of pantomimes before her musical theatre career kicked off with a part alongside Paul O'Grady in Prisoner Cell Block H: The Musical.",
      "The financial blows flared up again in 1995 when she and Brian were declared bankrupt. They were saved when a newspaper then paid Linda \u00a317,000 to tell her story.",
      "She put their money problems down to the \"feast or famine\" nature of showbiz.",
      "'Stabbed in the back'",
      "In 2000, Linda landed her most successful role, in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers, taking over as Mrs Johnstone from her younger sister Bernie.",
      "But it was also at the start of the 2000s that Linda's world, and that of her family, began to fall apart.",
      "First Anne was told she had breast cancer, then Brian was diagnosed with cancer of the skin. A year later, Linda was told she too had breast cancer.",
      "Anne recovered, and it was while Linda was undergoing treatment that she lost her husband of 26 years, a blow that left her contemplating suicide.",
      "\"He was the love of my life... I lost hope of ever being happy again and started thinking, as people do when they reach a certain point in depression, it would be better for everybody if I wasn't here and I would be doing them a favour,\" she revealed in early 2018.",
      "She was given the all-clear from cancer in 2006 but, too depressed to work, she started claiming benefits.",
      "Then in 2009 came a financial lifeline when Maureen, Linda, Bernie and Coleen were offered the chance of a reunion tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of I'm In The Mood For Dancing.",
      "The tour went well but, on the family front, things turned decidedly sour. Anne declared she had been \"stabbed in the back\" by her siblings.",
      "\"No-one asked me. No-one involved me at all until it was too late. Now they've made it clear I am not wanted,\" she told The Daily Mail.",
      "The sisters claimed the decision had been the record company's and out of their hands. It caused a further rupture in the already fractured family relationship.",
      "Financial blows",
      "But the next year, the sisters attempted to come together to support Bernie, who was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and chemotherapy and was given the all-clear. But in 2012 the cancer returned, leading to her death aged 52.",
      "The sisters' truce came to an end soon afterwards.",
      "In 2014, Linda's financial problems returned when she was investigated by Blackpool council and the Department for Work and Pensions for claiming benefits to the tune of \u00a312,000 while working.",
      "\"I thought I'd stuck to the rules religiously, but some of the things they thought of as 'work' just hadn't occurred to me. I thought working meant doing a stage show, not quick television interviews,\" she told The Telegraph.",
      "She came up with a repayment plan and eventually was issued with a caution.",
      "That same year, Linda went into the Celebrity Big Brother house (reportedly because she needed the money), an experience that led to her telling torrid tales about her sex life and coming to verbal blows with Davidson.",
      "The two had been enemies since the 90s, when Brian had been caught stealing money from Davidson's friend and fellow comedian Frank Carson.",
      "As sister Coleen became a panellist on ITV's Loose Women, Linda also became a regular guest.",
      "And it was on that show in 2017 that a tearful Coleen told viewers her sister's cancer had returned, and this time was terminal.",
      "Linda had resumed her stage work but then, with the second diagnosis, she stopped. In March 2023, she confirmed that the cancer had spread to her brain.",
      "But as she made clear in her autobiography From My Heart - released in 2018 - she refused to spend the time she had left to live \"constantly stressing about cancer\".",
      "She added: \"I've chosen to enjoy the little things. I've chosen to laugh. And I've chosen to look back on my life and thank God for it.\""

    "story": [
      "For years people have tried - and failed - to uncover details about Bristol's most famous, yet anonymous, graffiti artist Banksy.",
      "Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous.",
      "Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about.",
      "On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston.",
      "Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural.",
      "\"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building.",
      "\"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\"",
      "When Banksy came to Lawrence Weston youth centre",
      "Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous.",
      "The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds \u2013 oblivious to who the artist would eventually become.",
      "It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol.",
      "His friend had a suggestion \u2013 someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy.",
      "\"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said.",
      "This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.",

      "Banksy's Girl with Balloon print sells for \u00a380,000",
      "Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids.",
      "The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub.",
      "\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society.",
      "\"It was always very vibrant.\"",
      "Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston.",
      "He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said.",
      "\"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said.",
      "\"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas.",
      "\"Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented.",
      "\"It wasn't more Banksy than the young people, it was definitely a kind of 50/50 thing.\"",
      "And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy?",
      "\"For the first one [workshop], I think we paid him \u00a350. Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then,\" Peter said.",
      "\"I don't think he's ever been in it for the money. It shows what a deep, kind and caring person he is.\"",
      "The murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour \u2013 but with meaning.",
      "Cows looking up as bombs are dropped above them, which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety, while another was more obscure - a circus overrun by robots.",
      "'I painted over a Banksy'",
      "But what happened to these murals? They were painted over. Again and again.",
      "\"I personally painted over a Banksy. I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up,\" Peter said.",

      "\"I have no regrets at all [covering them up]. Back then, it was much more about working with and engaging young people.",
      "\"And it was just another art project back then.\"",

      "He wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world.",
      "\"I'm very proud he came here,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:59:47 GMT",
    "summary": "As Love Island All Stars returns, we find out if reality stars can still have a lucrative social media career.",
    "story": [
      "The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers.",
      "More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on.",
      "Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.",
      "But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end?",
      "Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users.",
      "Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company.",
      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",
      "\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.",
      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",
      "'Just being good looking is not going to get you much'",
      "Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.",
      "\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.",
      "\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.",
      "Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".",
      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",
      "\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds.",
      "'People would do adverts for every single company'",
      "Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures.",
      "At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million.",
      "With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal.",
      "Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media.",

    "title": "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",
      "Inside story of Biden's undoing: 'Infighting, frustration and an insular inner circle'",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",
      "\"Vaccine confidence across Europe is now really struggling and we can't just assume it's going to bounce back without a concerted effort.\"",

      "But in a statement, Tanzania's Health Minister Jenista Mhagama said after samples were analysed, all suspected cases were found negative for Marburg virus.",
      "She said that the country had strengthened its surveillance systems and disease monitoring.",
      "We \"would like to assure the international organisations, including WHO that we shall always keep them up to date with ongoing developments,\" Mhagama said.",
      "Tanzania experienced its first Marburg outbreak in March 2023 in the Bukoba district. It killed six people and lasted for nearly two months.",
      "The highly infectious disease is similar to Ebola, with symptoms including fever, muscle pains, diarrhoea, vomiting and, in some cases, death through extreme blood loss.",

      "What is the Marburg virus and how dangerous is it?",
      "The WHO reported that patients, including healthcare workers, had been identified and were being monitored.",
      "It added that the country's rapid response teams had been deployed to help identify suspected cases and contain the outbreak.",
      "The WHO cautioned that the risk of the suspected virus spreading in the region remained \"high\" because Kagera was a transit hub with much cross-border movement to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.",
      "\"We do not recommend travel or trade restrictions with Tanzania at this time,\" Dr Tedros said on X.",
      "The WHO said the global risk posed by the outbreak was \"low\", and there were no concerns at this stage of the disease spreading internationally.",
      "Following the reports, a team of experts was immediately deployed to Kagera region, where they collected specimens, said Tanzania's health minister.",
      "She said that laboratory results had ruled out the suspected Marburg outbreak but the minister did not clarify the total number of suspected cases investigated.",
      "In December, neighbouring Rwanda declared an outbreak in the country, which had  infected 66 people and killed 15, was over.",
      "On average, the Marburg virus kills half of the people it infects, according to the WHO.",
      "The Marburg virus is transmitted to humans from fruit bats and then through contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals.",

    "story": [
      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",
      "\"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me.",
      "\"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said.",
      "Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI.",

      "In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet.",
      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89",

      "display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",
      "Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website",
      "But BMI has limitations.",
      "It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat.",
      "So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat.",
      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",
      "But others worry pressure on health budgets could mean less money for patients in the \"pre-obesity\" category.",

      "The report describes sick leave as an \"inappropriate and inadequate\" way of supporting staff through baby loss, and points out that the low rate of statutory sick pay means some people cannot afford to take the time off that they need.",
      "Kath Abrahams, chief executive of Tommy's, the pregnancy and baby charity, said she hoped the government would move quickly to change the law.",
      "\"For too many women, the psychological and physical impact of pregnancy loss is compounded by pressure to return to work immediately and a lack of time to grieve,\" she said.",
      "\"It is unacceptable that sickness absence often remains the only option, potentially leaving women and their partners financially vulnerable,\" she added.",

      "In a subsequent letter to the committee's chair, the NCA's Director-General, Graeme Biggar, pointed to the \"complex and lengthy\" nature of the cases.",
      "He said that similar cases in comparable countries took an average of seven years to be completed.",
      "The Sanctions and Anti Money Laundering Act, which is the legislation used to bring prosecutions, was only introduced four years ago.",
      "Mr Biggar said: \"Financial investigations of this nature are typically complex and lengthy. As a result, there have been no concluded prosecutions for offences under the new Sanctions and Anti Money Laundering Act.\"",

      "In November, David Lammy said Western sanctions had \"deprived Russia of more than $400 billion since February 2022, which is equivalent to four more years of funding for the invasion\".",
      "When asked by MPs whether he would be taking action against UK companies helping facilitate the Russian oil industry, he said, \"There is more to come, I suspect, over the coming days.\"",

      "In her first major speech of 2025, Badenoch attacked the Labour's government but also her own party for repeatedly pledging to lower immigration as numbers \"kept going up\" and for promising net zero carbon emissions by 2050 without a clear plan.",

      "Badenoch has not named who she holds responsible, but in her speech said: \"We announced that we would leave the European Union before we had a plan for growth outside the EU.",
      "\"We made it the law that we would deliver net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And only then did we start thinking about how we would do that.",
      "\"We announced that we would lower immigration, but immigration kept going up.",

      "Amesbury, who represents Runcorn and Helsby, pleaded guilty to assaulting the 45-year-old Paul Fellows at Chester Magistrates' Court.",
      "He had been suspended from the Labour Party after the footage appeared of the fracas, which occurred in Frodsham, Cheshire, at 02:45 GMT on 26 October last year.",
      "The video, which did not show the lead up to the altercation, recorded Amesbury shouting: \"You won't threaten the MP ever again, will you?\"",
      "Alison Storey, prosecuting, told the court how, at about 02:00, Mr Fellows was in Frodsham town centre and went to a taxi rank.",
      "He was alone and had been drinking, she said.",
      "Ms Storey said: \"Mr Amesbury arrived at the same taxi rank. He too was alone and he too had been drinking.\"",
      "The court heard Mr Fellows recognised Amesbury and approached him to remonstrate about a bridge closure in the town.",
      "She said CCTV showed an engagement between them over a period of several minutes, but with no aggression or raised voices.",
      "She said: \"At one point Mr Fellows started to walk away but was re-engaged by Mr Amesbury.\"",
      "Amesbury, 55, was then heard to say \"what\" a few times before shouting it, the court heard.",
      "Ms Storey said Mr Fellows put his hands in his pockets and turned towards the taxi queue but, when he turned back, Amesbury punched him to the head, knocking him to the ground.",
      "He followed him on to the road after he fell and started to punch him again at least five times, she said.",
      "Amesbury, who now sits as an independent MP, won his seat at the general election in July with a majority of 14,696.",
      "He had served under Labour since 2017 and was a shadow minister between 2018 and 2024. He was previously a local councillor in Manchester.",
      "District Judge Tanveer Ikram said the guidelines suggested a sentence starting point of a \"high level community order or a range up to a prison sentence\".",
      "\"I have already made mention of the fact whilst there was a single punch to the face, the victim ended up on the floor and he was further attacked again on the floor. That seems to me an additional aggravating factor,\" he said.",
      "\"I am leaving all options upon at this stage.\"",
      "Richard Derby, defending Amesbury, said the assault was a \"momentary incident\".",
      "He said: \"Rightly or wrongly, Mr Amesbury interpreted what was being said as no longer a conversation but something to which he thought there was another motive to.\"",
      "He set out security measures which Amesbury had in place and said a death threat was sent to his office in November.",
      "Mr Derby added: \"Whatever sanction this court will impose upon him, it's not going to have the effect as what has already happened to him.",
      "\"The embarrassment he has suffered, the shame he has suffered, removing the whip from him, a person who has dedicated his life to the public.\"",
      "Amesbury was granted bail to return for sentencing on 24 February.",
      "'Shocking'",
      "Asked if he had any comment following the hearing, the MP said he wanted to apologise to Mr Fellows.",
      "He told reporters: \"It's highly regrettable, the incident in October.",
      "\"I'm sincerely sorry to Mr Fellows and his family.\"",
      "Amesbury's defence solicitor said the incident was \"regrettable and unfortunate\".",
      "He said the public were not aware of the lengths of security and threats MPs face every day.",
      "He mentioned how a man was previously convicted of stalking Amesbury and how, last November, he had received a death threat to his office.",
      "He also said there were comments made that, rightly or wrongly, the MP had \"taken as some form of threat to himself\".",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously described the video footage as \"shocking\" and said Labour had \"moved very swiftly\" to respond.",
      "Following the guilty plea, a party spokesman said: \"It is right that Mike Amesbury has taken responsibility for his unacceptable actions.",
      "\"He was rightly suspended by the Labour Party following the announcement of the police investigation.",
      "\"We cannot comment further whilst legal proceedings are still ongoing.\"",
      "Amesbury would need to receive a prison sentence \u2013 including a suspended sentence \u2013 in order for there to be a recall petition in his seat of Runcorn and Helsby.",
      "That recall petition would then need more than 10 per cent of voters in his constituency to sign it to trigger a by-election.",
      "A recall petition would also be triggered if the House of Commons decided to suspend him for 10 sitting days or more. If he were to resign, that would also lead to a by-election.",

    "story": [
      "The government will look at \"every conceivable way\" to prevent former Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams from receiving compensation, the prime minister has said.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer was speaking in the House of Commons after the Conservatives said it was \"shameful\" that repealing the Legacy Act could put Mr Adams in line for a \"cheque\".",
      "The Legacy Act presently blocks him - and many others interned without trial in the 1970s - from claiming compensation for unlawful detention.",
      "Mr Adams was detained in the early 1970s when the government in Northern Ireland introduced internment as violence spiralled in the early years of the Troubles.",
      "More than 1,900 people suspected of being members of paramilitary organisations were detained, but many were arrested based on flawed intelligence.",

      "Labour, which has begun the process of repealing the act, said the previous government's approach to legacy was \"almost universally opposed in Northern Ireland\".",
      "If the Legacy Act was repealed, it is thought highly likely Mr Adams would pursue compensation.",
      "Several peers have backed a report by Policy Exchange, a London-based think tank, criticising moves to lift the ban.",
      "In a statement following the prime minister's comments, Mr Adams said people should remain cautious about what exactly was being proposed.",
      "He said a Supreme Court ruling in 2020 that his detention had been unlawful was \"explicit\".",
      "\"When the legislation is changed there will almost certainly be further legal process in the courts before there is clarity on this matter,\" he said.",

      "Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), Sir Keir said the act was \"unfit\" because it was not supported by victims or political parties.",
      "He referred to the Northern Ireland High Court ruling that part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.",
      "\"We will put in place a better framework, we're working on a draft remedial order and replacement legislation and we will look at every conceivable way to prevent these types of cases claiming damages and it's important I say that on the record,\" he said.",
      "If Mr Adams was successful with a compensation bid, it could result in a six-figure payout.",
      "This would cover both his unlawful detention and a prosecution for attempted escapes, for which he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years imprisonment.",
      "Speaking after Sir Keir's comments at PMQs, his official spokesman said he could not guarantee that compensation payments to Mr Adams or other former Troubles internees would be prevented.",
      "\"Clearly the government's intention is to prevent compensation from being paid,\" he said.",
      "\"We are going to look at every option but I can't get ahead of that process.",

      "Victims' campaigner Kenny Donaldson said there had been cross-party opposition to compensation for Mr Adams and that the current government should uphold this position.",
      "He added that if there was a move to a position where \"Gerry Adams is compensated in this situation, then really we have debased society to an additional level and that would be a dagger to the heart of so many people\".",
      "Democratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson said it would be \"absurd if money from the public purse was to be handed to Gerry Adams\".",
      "\"The government needs to stop hiding behind court judgements,\" Robinson said.",
      "\"Parliament is sovereign and should legislate accordingly.",
      "\"It is imperative that we prioritise the needs and concerns of victims and their families, ensuring that justice and common sense prevail in such matters.\"",

      "\"Of course, as the last government did, we will continue to see if we can find a lawful way of dealing with the issue he has identified,\" said Benn.",
      "Meanwhile the attorney general for England and Wales was asked during an appearance at the Commons Justice Committee about previously acting as a legal representative for Mr Adams.",
      "Lord Hermer said he wasn't \"inclined\" to answer questions on how he was remunerated for his work for \"any given client\".",

      "\"Both clients understood the importance of being able to represent everybody, that's what a legal system is all about.\"",
      "What is the Legacy Act?",
      "The act was the government's controversial attempt to \"draw a line\" under the Troubles in Northern Ireland.",
      "It was first proposed by the then prime minister Boris Johnson in 2021 as a solution to ending what he called \"vexatious prosecutions\" of former soldiers.",
      "It was passed in 2023, but was opposed by victims' groups and all the main political parties in Northern Ireland.",
      "The act created a new legacy body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).",
      "It also shut down all historical inquests.",
      "The act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, was disapplied following legal action by bereaved families.",
      "The court ruled this part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.",
      "Labour pledged to repeal the Legacy Act if they won the general election in July and formally began that process in December.",
      "Why could Gerry Adams seek compensation?",
      "A Supreme Court judgement in 2020 paved the way for Mr Adams to receive damages after it quashed his convictions over two attempted prison break-outs.",
      "It ruled his detention was unlawful because the interim custody order (ICO) had not been \"considered personally\" by the then Northern Ireland Secretary Willie Whitelaw.",
      "At the time, the Conservative government argued the ICOs were lawful due to a convention known as the Carltona principle, where officials and junior ministers routinely act in the name of a secretary of state.",

      "Currently only those who lose a child or a baby after 24 weeks are entitled to two weeks of paid leave. But a group of MPs is calling for the upcoming Employment Rights Bill to extend this to all pregnancy loss.",
      "A Department for Business spokesperson said losing a baby was \"incredibly difficult and we know many employers will show compassion and understanding in these circumstances.\"",
      "But Anna Malnutt said she went back to work three days after miscarrying: \"I just didn't really know how long was OK to take, and I felt like I needed to go back.\"",

      "Despite her boss being very supportive, she decided to go back to work three days after her first miscarriage, and it was recorded as sick leave.",

      "\"They were his babies too. And he never really got time or space to grieve for that himself,\" she said.",
      "Anna says it also meant he couldn't support her in the way he would have wanted to.",

      "It is estimated that more than one in five pregnancies end before 24 weeks and around 20% of women will experience baby loss in their lifetime, according to data in the report by the cross-party Women and Equalities Committee.",
      "It is proposing bereavement leave should be extended to include those who experienced ectopic pregnancy - when a fertilised egg develops outside of the womb, molar pregnancy - when an egg is not fertilised correctly, IVF embryo transfer loss and terminations for medical reasons.",
      "More bereaved parents offered baby-loss certificate",
      "The committee acknowledged that several employers, including NHS Trusts and the Co-op, already had policies in place for employees who experienced baby loss.",
      "However, it said this was not universal.",
      "The committee chairman, Labour MP Sarah Owen, shared her own experience of baby loss.",
      "\"I was not prepared for the shock of miscarrying at work during my first pregnancy,\" she said.",
      "\"Like many women, I legally had to take sick leave. But I was grief stricken, not sick, harbouring a deep sense of loss.\"",
      "The report describes sick leave as an \"inappropriate and inadequate\" way of supporting staff through baby loss, and points out that the low rate of statutory sick pay means some people cannot afford to take the time off that they need.",
      "Kath Abrahams, chief executive of Tommy's, the pregnancy and baby charity, said she hoped the government would move quickly to change the law.",
      "\"For too many women, the psychological and physical impact of pregnancy loss is compounded by pressure to return to work immediately and a lack of time to grieve,\" she said.",
      "\"It is unacceptable that sickness absence often remains the only option, potentially leaving women and their partners financially vulnerable,\" she added.",

      "MPs have voted for a new, one-month cap on advance rent payments in England as the Renters' Rights Bill edges closer to becoming law.",
      "Housing minister Matthew Pennycook confirmed the addition of a clause to stop landlords making upfront charges in the Commons on Tuesday.",
      "Landlord groups have warned the move could leave property owners open to risk if tenants have no other way of proving their ability to pay rent on an ongoing basis.",
      "And Independent MP Jeremy Corbyn warned some tenants were being evicted before the package of protections in the Bill, which includes a ban on \"no-fault\" evictions, can come into effect as expected this summer.",
      "Aim for no-fault eviction ban to be in place by summer",
      "Charities warn bill doesn't protect renters enough",
      "Bill banning no-fault evictions to return to Parliament",
      "Setting out the details of the cap in the Commons, Pennycook said the government wanted to stop demands for \"large rent-in-advance payments\", which he said could sometimes amount to 12 months of rent.",
      "Tenants who were \"perfectly able to afford the monthly rent\" were being asked to give landlords \"ever larger sums\" in advance, he said, or \"risk being locked out of renting altogether\".",
      "The latest move comes on top of existing measures intended to stop bidding wars for homes where \"often desperate tenants are pitted against each other so that landlords are able to extract the highest possible payment they can\"..",
      "Shadow housing minister David Simmonds said the bill had \"many shortcomings\" and would create \"concerns around the availability, and the affordability of accommodation in the private rented sector\".",
      "A coalition of groups representing landlords and letting agents claimed the cap on upfront payments could leave tenants unable to prove their ability to cover their rent.",
      "The groups, including the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA), said: \"Cutting off any assurance landlords might seek when renting to those who cannot easily prove their ability to afford a tenancy is neither practical nor responsible.\"",
      "But some MPs, including Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer, called for the government to go further and introduce rent controls.",
      "The Bristol Central MP said the high cost of renting was leaving people \"on the streets\" so \"rent controls are still needed - because having the right to something you cannot afford and cannot access is no help to anyone\".",
      "Labour's Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who is a renter and the MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, said rent rises should be capped because \"I'm yet to hear a compelling reason why landlords should see their incomes grow faster than people who actually work for a living\".",
      "And former Labour leader Corbyn suggested evictions were happening before protections could be introduced, saying \"there seems to be quite a lot of landlords at the present time who are using unreasonable arguments in order to terminate tenancies or raise rents ahead of this legislation coming in\".",
      "Pennycook acknowledged there was \"a lot of bad practice in the sector\" that the government was keen to clamp down on, and acknowledged the potential for \"retaliatory economic no-fault evictions\" in the interim period.",
      "However, he drew the line at rent controls, saying there was evidence the measure could harm tenants.",
      "\"Once Section 21 [\"no-fault\"] evictions are done away with, unscrupulous landlords will no doubt attempt to evict tenants who assert their rights by means of extortionate rent rises,\" he said.",
      "However, he added, \"the government sincerely believe that the introduction of rent controls in the private rented sector could harm tenants as well as landlords as a result of reduced supply, and discourage investment\".",
      "Polly Neate, the chief executive of housing charity Shelter, welcomed the new cap on advance payments - but urged the government to go further on controlling rent rises.",
      "She said: \"For years, renters have been forced to magic up eye-watering sums up-front or see their hopes for a home vanish.",
      "\"With benefit recipients nearly twice as likely to be blocked from renting by demands for rent up-front, the government is absolutely right to use the Renters' Rights Bill to rein this discriminatory practice in.",
      "\"To truly make renting more secure and affordable, the Bill must limit in-tenancy rent increases in line with either inflation or wage growth.\"",

    "story": [
      "The embattled and heavily criticised chair of the miscarriages of justice review body the Criminal Cases Review Commission has resigned.",
      "Helen Pitcher had been criticised for the agency's failings in relation to the Andy Malkinson affair,  which saw Mr Malkinson spend 17 years in jail for a rape he did not commit.",
      "Ms Pitcher told the Times in an interview that she had been made a scapegoat.",
      "Mr Malkinson called Ms Pitcher's statement \"shameless\", adding: \"I know what it truly is like to be a scapegoat.\"",
      "The BBC understands Mrs Pitcher spoke to the newspaper before telling ministers or senior members of the commission that she was resigning.",
      "A government source said Ms Pitcher had \"jumped as she was pushed\", as the prime minister had received an independent recommendation to advise the King to remove her from office.",
      "Last summer, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood began the formal process of sending a recommendation to the King that Ms Pitcher should go, after personally concluding that she was not fit to head the CCRC.",
      "That decision came after a damning independent report into how the CCRC had mishandled Mr Malkinson's pleas for help, and how the chair herself had presented its work on his case.",
      "While he was in jail, the CCRC twice rejected Mr Malkinson's submissions that he was innocent. The second of those rejections came after Mrs Pitcher had become chair in 2018.",
      "He was only cleared in 2023 after exhaustive work by his own legal team tracked down the long-available DNA evidence that showed another man must have committed the rape in 2003.",
      "The first of two independent reviews - commissioned by the CCRC itself - found that the body  had failed to complete basic work that could have cast doubt on Mr Malkinson's conviction. It said Mrs Pitcher's statements as chair had not properly reflected these failings.",
      "A second, judge-led, inquiry into wider alleged failings into all agencies, including  Greater Manchester Police which first accused Mr Malkinson of the crime, is continuing.",
      "Despite the criticisms of Ms Pitcher, ministers had no power to sack her directly because the CCRC is an independent criminal justice body.",
      "The chair is appointed by the King to ensure the agency's separation from ministers, prosecutors and judges.",
      "That meant the Ministry of Justice had to exceptionally set up an independent panel to assess whether Ms Pitcher was fit to remain in office.",
      "The panel's majority findings led Mahmood to send a recommendation to the prime minister to advise the King to remove the chair. The full details of the panel's report are confidential.",
      "Had Ms Pitcher not quit, it is thought she would have been the first public servant in modern times to be sacked by the monarch under such a process.",
      "'Scapegoat' claim",
      "In her resignation letter, Mr Pitcher said she had been made a scapegoat by Alex Chalk KC, the Conservatives' last justice secretary.",
      "Mr Chalk, who the BBC has contacted, did not start the process to remove Ms Pitcher but had launched the judge-led inquiry into the actions of all agencies in the Malkinson case.",
      "\"The trigger for convening the panel was based on understandable media outrage over the appalling treatment of Andrew Malkinson,\" Ms Pitcher said in her letter.",
      "\"Serious questions remain for Greater Manchester Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "\"I note that the DPP [the director of public prosecutions, who heads the CPS] and the chief constable of the GMP have not been the subject of comparable criticism.",
      "\"It feels unfair that I, who supported sending Mr Malkinson's case back to judges, have been singled out.\"",
      "But Mr Malkinson told the BBC: \"Helen Pitcher's attempt to portray herself as the victim here is shameless.",
      "\"I know what it truly is like to be a scapegoat.",
      "\"I agree, however, that others need to be held accountable.",
      "\"The CCRC's senior leadership, starting with the CEO, must also resign to pave the way for root-and-branch reform.",
      "\"I am astonished that the outgoing chair claims that the CCRC was able to 'resolve the situation,' and set me free.",
      "\"That work was done by my team at [legal charity] Appeal, not the CCRC, who were considering rejecting my case for a third time.",
      "\"Going forward, it is crucial that the CCRC is led by people with the guts to challenge miscarriages of justice, even if that means taking on forces like the police and judiciary.\"",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The Lord Chancellor established an independent panel to consider Helen Pitcher's role as chair of the CCRC. We welcome her resignation.",

    "story": [
      "If you were to produce a political heat map of the government right now, there is one big bit that would be bright red, and probably flashing: the Treasury.",
      "Firstly, there have been all of the headlines about the now former Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq.",
      "For all of the complexities and subtleties of this story, and there are plenty, the inescapable crux of it was something even the most polished public relations executive would struggle to add much gloss to.",
      "The minister responsible for the government's anti-corruption drive was named in a corruption investigation.",
      "Awkward.",
      "It is vital to stress Tulip Siddiq has always insisted she has done nothing wrong and the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial standards concluded she had not broken the ministerial code.",

      "The now former minister's aunt Sheikh Hasina was the country's prime minister until she was deposed last year.",
      "In an interview with the Sunday Times at the weekend, her replacement, Muhammad Yunus, said that homes used by Tulip Siddiq in the UK should be handed back to his government if they had been gained through \"plain robbery.\"",
      "And what are the responsibilities of the economic secretary to the Treasury?",
      "Well, tackling economic crime, money laundering and illicit finance among other things.",
      "And remember, politics isn't a court of law, but a court of perceptions \u2013 where unanswered questions are dangerous because they amount to more headlines, however fair or otherwise that might be.",
      "The independent adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, concluded that \"given the nature of Ms Siddiq's ministerial responsibilities... it is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks.\"",
      "And, he added: \"I would not advise that this shortcoming should be taken as a breach of the ministerial code, but you will want to consider her ongoing responsibilities in the light of this.\"",
      "Oh dear.",
      "And she is out, but this was a resignation with warmth on both sides with the prime minister suggesting publicly she could well serve as a minister again.",
      "Contrast that, incidentally, with the three-sentence missive he rattled off to Louise Haigh, when she resigned as transport secretary in November.",
      "Let's turn next to the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has also struggled to get herself out of the headlines.",
      "The prime minister has heaped praise on her and expressed a parliament's worth of confidence in her.",
      "The dip in inflation in the latest figures just published are better than the alternative for Rachel Reeves - albeit the rate at which prices are rising is still higher than the target the Bank of England aims for.",
      "But the soaring cost of government borrowing is a symptom of the markets collectively sounding unconvinced by the government's economic strategy.",
      "The chancellor has said \"the economic headwinds we face are a reminder that we must go further and faster to kick start economic growth that plunged under the last government\".",
      "What does that mean?",
      "They'll crack on with what they call their \"industrial strategy\" \u2013 there will be more announcements like the one about artificial intelligence on Monday.",

      "From the prime minister's perspective, the aspirin of resignation eases the Tulip Siddiq headache he has had to endure.",

    "story": [
      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",

      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",

      "Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.",
      "This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.",
      "It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.",
      "But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?",
      "And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.",
      "A crazy idea 'that works'",
      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:34:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Pigs, donkeys and even a mini cow named Cuddles found a temporary home after the LA fires.",
    "story": [
      "The trailers arrived all at once, carrying hundreds of horses fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.",
      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

    "summary": "Nine in 10 new cars in the country are now battery-powered, and it aims to hit 100% later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

    "story": [
      "A looming TikTok ban has connected Chinese and American citizens like never before, as they swap jokes and memes in what one user described as a \"historic moment\".",
      "It's all unfolding on a popular Chinese social media app called RedNote, or Xiaohongshu (literally translates as Little Red Book), which doesn't have the usual internet firewall that separates China from the rest of the world.",
      "It has been drawing self-professed US \"TikTok refugees\" seeking a new home on the internet - despite the fact that their own government is seeking a TikTok ban because of national security concerns.",
      "Americans now find themselves in direct contact with 300 million Mandarin speakers in China and elsewhere \u2013 while in the real world, Beijing is bracing for a tumultuous Trump presidency that could strain its fragile ties with Washington.",
      "'We're here to spite our government'",
      "At the heart of the US ban is the fear that China is using TikTok to spy on Americans.",
      "The app has faced accusations that user data is ending up in the hands of the Chinese government - because of a Beijing law that requires local companies to \"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\". TikTok denies this has ever happened, or that it would happen.",
      "But the possibility doesn't seem to worry some US users - 700,000 new users have signed on to RedNote in the last two days, making it the most downloaded free app in the US App store.",
      "\"The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they're insisting that it's owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,\" said one new RedNote user, Definitelynotchippy.",
      "He goes on to explain why he is on RedNote: \"A lot of us are smarter than that though so we decided to piss off our government and download an actual Chinese app. We call that trolling, so in short we're here to spite our government and to learn about China and hang out with you guys.\"",
      "TikTok, although owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is headquartered in Singapore and says it is run independently. In fact, China's version of TikTok is another app called Douyin. RedNote, on the other hand, is a Chinese company based in Shanghai and among the few social media apps available both in China and outside.",
      "So Washington's fears over TikTok would extend to RedNote as well.",
      "That's why American users on RedNote are referring to themselves as \"Chinese spies\" - continuing a TikTok trend where people have been bidding farewell to their \"personal Chinese spy\" who has allegedly been surveilling them over the years.",
      "RedNote is now full of posts where ex-TikTok users are in search of a replacement. One post says: \"I'm looking for my Chinese spy. I miss you. Please help me find him.\"",
      "And Chinese users have answered: \"I'm here!\"",
      "'People-to-people exchanges'",
      "The honest, funny conversations on RedNote may not be what Chinese President Xi Jinping had in mind when he spoke about \"strengthening people-to-people cultural exchanges\" between China and the US.",

      "Food, streaming shows and jobs have been the most popular topics: \"Is life in America similar to how it looks on [the US TV show] Friends?\"",
      "Other Chinese users demanded a \"tax\" for using the platform - cat photos.",
      "\"Cat tax from California,\" reads one post in response. \"Here's my offering - the shorthair is a boy named Bob and the calico is a girl named Marley.\"",
      "Still others are using the platform to ask Americans for help with their English homework.",
      "One post reads: \"Dear TikTok refugees, could you please tell me the answer to question 53? Is the answer T (true) or F (false)?\"",
      "Help came quickly: some 500 people have since answered.",
      "The flood of new American users appears to have caught RedNote off guard - reports say the company is hiring English moderators.",
      "And others are trying to cash in on RedNote's new-found US stardom as well: language-learning app Duolingo put out a graph showing a 216% jump in its user base, compared to this time last year.",
      "Is RedNote the new TikTok?",
      "RedNote's rising popularity is not guaranteed to last though.",
      "There is no reason to assume it won't face blowback for the same reasons as TikTok:  concerns that it could be used by China to spy on Americans.",
      "It's unclear how long Beijing would be open to such unfettered exchanges - control of the internet is key to its repressive regime.",
      "The irony of the situation was flagged by one Chinese user, who posted: \"Don't we have a (fire)wall? How come so many foreigners can enter, when clearly I can't leave?\"",
      "Typically, Chinese internet users have been unable to directly interact with foreigners. Global platforms like Twitter and Instagram and search engines like Google are blocked in China, though people use VPNs to circumvent these restrictions. Sensitive topics - from history to dissent - or anything seen as critical of China's government and ruling Communist party is swiftly censored.",
      "It's unclear how much RedNote is censored - it's largely used by younger and middle-aged women in China, where they share images and videos. It's not like Weibo, another Chinese app, where discussions and airing of grievances is far more common, leading to posts often being taken down.",
      "But a handful of new RedNote users say they have already received reports that their posts have violated guidelines, including one who asked in a post if the app was \"LGBT friendly\".",
      "Another said they had asked \"What [sic] Chinese think about gay people?\" and received a similar notification, that they had violated \"public moral order\" guidelines.",
      "And Chinese users keep reminding Americans on the app \"not to mention sensitive topics, such as politics, religion and drugs\".",
      "One Chinese user also advised them to stick to the \"One China policy\", the diplomatic pillar of the US-China relationship - according to which the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan, the self-governed island Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The US government has not commented on RedNote so far, and neither has Beijing.",
      "But Chinese state media seems upbeat about it, with Global Times even interviewing a US user who said she would \"love to interact with Chinese users\".",
      "RedNote's American fate is anyone's guess - but for now, at least online, the US-China rivalry is taking a break. Thanks to cat pictures."

      "But it is so readily available that campaign groups have raised concerns that children see it at a young age - with one in 10 children seeing it by age nine, according to a survey by the Children's Commissioner.",
      "\"As age checks start to roll out in the coming months, adults will start to notice a difference in how they access certain online services,\" said Dame Melanie.",

    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.",
      "But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it?",
      "Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he is opposed to, even if the courts uphold it?",
      "TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew will certainly hope so - the BBC's US partner CBS is reporting he will attend Trump's inauguration alongside former presidents and family members on 20 January.",
      "And whatever happens to the social media platform, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he is against the law - which would come into force the day before he returns to office - asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "His incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \"preserve\" TikTok regardless of the court's ruling, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved.",
      "The precise mechanism for doing that is unclear, though - according to the Washington Post - one option under consideration is for Trump to sign an executive order which would suspend the enforcement the law.",
      "\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\" Mr Waltz said.",
      "Another option would be for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

    "summary": "Leading tech firms are said to have committed \u00a314bn towards the project, which could create more than 13,000 jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",
      "Among the government's proposals are:",
      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",
      "\"Labour's economic mismanagement and uninspiring plan will mean Britain is left behind,\" he said.",
      "Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC there was no reason why the UK could not create tech companies on the same scale as Google, Amazon, and Apple.",
      "\"At the moment, we don't have any frontier conceptual, cutting-edge companies that are British-owned.\"",
      "He highlighted DeepMind, which created technology enabling computers to play video and board games, as an example of a former British-born company that was now US-owned.",
      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",
      "There are continuing questions over the risks of introducing AI systems that can \"hallucinate\" or make things up, or discriminate against certain groups of people due to bias.",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said \"we're only at the foothills of this\" and AI was a developing technology.",
      "He said a government-developed AI teaching assistant had been used by about 30,000 teachers in England so far.",
      "\"It saves teachers about three-and-half hours a week - gives them their Sunday evening back, if you like, in terms of lesson preparation and classroom preparation,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "McFadden said AI applications used by the health service can detect some cancers earlier which are not detectable by the human eye.",
      "However he acknowledged AI was \"not perfect\" after Apple faced calls to withdraw a controversial feature that generated inaccurate news alerts on its latest iPhones.",
      "\"We've got to have an eye on safety as well as opportunity,\" McFadden said.",
      "\"The truth is, you can't just opt out of this. Or if you do, you're just going to see it developed elsewhere.\"",

      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",

      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",

      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",

      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",

      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

    "title": "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 03:10:24 GMT",
    "summary": "China's economy has hit the government's 5% growth target for 2024 in the face of multiple challenges.",
    "story": [
      "China's economy rebounded in the last three months of last year, allowing the government to meet its growth target of 5% in 2024, Beijing announced on Friday.",
      "But it is one of the slowest rates of growth in decades as the world's second largest economy struggles to shake off a protracted property crisis, high local government debt and youth unemployment.",
      "The head of the country's statistics bureau said China's economic achievements in 2024 were \"hard won,\" after the government launched a slew of stimulus measures late last year.",
      "Beijing has rarely missed its growth targets in the past.",
      "Experts had broadly predicted this rate of growth. The World Bank said lower borrowing costs and rising exports would mean China could achieve annual growth of 4.9%.",
      "Investors, however, are bracing themselves: the threat of President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs on $500bn (\u00a3409bn) worth of Chinese goods looms large.",
      "Yet that is not all that stands in the way of China achieving its growth targets next year.",
      "Business and consumer confidence is low, and the Chinese yuan will continue to weaken as Beijing cuts interest rates in a bid to boost growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why Xi has bigger challenges than Trump's tariffs:",
      "1. Tariffs are already hurting Chinese exports",
      "There is a growing chorus of warnings that China's economy will slow in 2025. One major driving factor of last year's growth is now at risk: exports.",
      "China has relied on manufacturing to help exit the slowdown - so, it has been exporting a record number of electric vehicles, 3D printers and industrial robots.",
      "The US, Canada and the European Union have accused China of making too many goods and imposed tariffs on Chinese imports to protect domestic jobs and businesses.",
      "Experts say Chinese exporters may now focus on other parts of the world. But those countries are likely to be in emerging markets, which don't have the same levels of demand as North America and Europe.",
      "That could impact Chinese businesses that are hoping to expand, in turn hitting suppliers of energy and raw materials.",
      "Xi wants to transform China from the world's factory for cheap goods into a high-tech powerhouse by 2035 but it's unclear how manufacturing can continue to be such a big growth driver in the face of rising tariffs.",
      "2. People are just not spending enough",
      "In China, household wealth is largely invested in the property market. Before the real estate crisis, it accounted for almost a third of China's economy - employing millions of people, from builders and developers to cement producers and interior designers.",
      "Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms.",
      "But there are still too many empty homes and commercial properties, and that oversupply continues to force down prices.",
      "The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a \"multi-year drag\" on China's economic growth.",
      "It's already hit spending hard - in the last three months of 2024, household consumption contributed just 29% to China's economic activity, down from 59% before the pandemic.",
      "That is one of the reasons Beijing has stepped up exports. It wants to help offset sluggish domestic spending on new cars, luxury items and almost everything else.",
      "The government has even introduced programmes like consumer goods trade-ins, where people can exchange their washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers.",
      "But experts wonder whether these kinds of measures alone are sufficient without addressing deeper issues in the economy.",
      "They say people will need more money in their pockets before pre-Covid levels for spending return.",
      "\"China needs to bring back the animal spirit of the population and we are still far from that,\" said Shuang Ding, Chief Economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.",
      "\"If the private sector starts to invest and innovate that could increase income and the job outlook, and people will have more confidence to consume.\"",
      "Steep public debt and unemployment have also affected savings and spending.",
      "Official figures suggest the youth jobless rate remains high compared to before the pandemic, and that wage rises have stalled.",
      "3. Businesses are not flocking to China like they used to",
      "President Xi has promised to invest in the cutting-edge industries that the government calls \"new productive forces\".",
      "Until now, that has helped China become a leader in goods like renewable energy products such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries.",
      "Last year, China also overtook Japan as the world's biggest car exporter.",
      "But the lacklustre economic picture, uncertainty over tariffs and other geopolitical uncertainties mean the appetite of foreign businesses for investment in China is subdued.",
      "It's not about foreign or domestic investment - it's that businesses don't see a bright future, said Stephanie Leung from wealth management platform StashAway.",
      "\"They would like to see a more diversified set of investors coming in.\"",
      "For all of these reasons, experts believe the measures to support the economy will only partially alleviate the impact of potential new US tariffs.",
      "Beijing must either undertake big, bold measures or accept that the economy is not going to grow so fast, Goldman Sachs' Chief China Economist Hui Shan wrote in a recent report, adding: \"We expect them to choose the former.\"",
      "\"China needs to stabilise property markets and create sufficient jobs to ensure social stability,\" Mr Ding from Standard Chartered Bank said.",
      "According to researcher China Dissent Monitor, there were more than 900 protests in China between June and September 2024 led by workers and property owners - 27% more than the same period a year earlier.",
      "These sort of social strains as a result of economic grievances and an erosion of wealth will be a concern for the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "After all, explosive growth turned China into a global power, and the promise of increased prosperity has largely helped its leaders keep a tight lid on dissent."

      "Bezos's company Blue Origin has struggled to match the pace set by SpaceX. But this launch will be seen as a major step forward for the business.",
      "The New Glenn rocket was named after John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit Earth more than 60 years ago.",
      "The rocket is more powerful than SpaceX's most commonly used rocket, the Falcon 9. It can also carry more satellites, and Bezos wants to use it as part of his Project Kuiper, which aims to deploy thousands of low-earth satellites to provide broadband services.",
      "That project would compete directly with Musk's Starlink service.",
      "Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin 25 years ago, claiming he wanted \"millions of people working and living in space.\"",
      "For years the venture has sent a smaller, reusable rocket called New Shepard to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. It has carried passengers and payloads, including Bezos himself in 2021.",
      "But Blue Origin has been dramatically outperformed by SpaceX, which launched its rockets 134 times last year.",
      "And SpaceX's new generation of rocket, called Starship, is more powerful still. The company hopes to launch it in its seventh test flight later today.",
      "Some experts say a successful New Glenn rocket will create real competition between the two companies and could drive down the costs of space operations.",
      "\"What you are going to see are these two companies challenge each other to make even greater strides,\" suggests Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University in the UK.",
      "Governments have historically spent billions on building rockets and sending missions into space.",
      "But US space agency NASA is increasingly moving away from relying only on public money and has issued huge contracts to private companies to provide rockets and other space services.",
      "Elon Musk's SpaceX has already received billions of dollars worth of space contracts.",

      "A senior Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three female soldiers on the first day of the ceasefire. Mediators in Doha are trying an earlier start to the ceasefire, Thursday evening instead of Sunday.",
      "Until the ceasefire does come into effect, the war that started when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 goes on. At least 12 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes on northern Gaza around the time the ceasefire was announced.",
      "In what has been at times even an hourly ritual over the last 15 months, video has come out of northern Gaza showing their bodies being carried out of ambulances in sheets and laid out in a line outside a hospital.",
      "The ceasefire is a considerable diplomatic achievement. It's long overdue. Versions of the deal have been on the table since it was announced by US President Joe Biden in May last year. Hamas and Israel have blamed each other for the delays.",

      "Israel does not allow international journalists to enter Gaza to report freely, so the BBC and other news organisations rely on valiant Palestinian journalists to gather news for us. Reporting of the last 15 months of war would have been impossible without them. Israel has killed more than 200 Palestinian journalists in Gaza.",
      "Umm Muhammad, an elderly Palestinian woman, told one of our journalists she felt happy and relieved.",
      "\"The pain has disappeared a bit, though it's still there. Hopefully it will be overcome by joy. Let our prisoners get freed and the injured get treated. People are exhausted.\"",
      "Apart from survival there is not much to celebrate for Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has killed almost 50,000 people at least. More than two million people have been forced out of their homes by Israeli military action.",
      "Israel's response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 that killed around 1200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, has left Gaza in ruins. According to the Hamas run health ministry, Israeli attacks have killed almost 50,000 people, both combatants and civilians. A recent study in the Lancet medical journal says that might be a major underestimate.",
      "In Tel Aviv, it was also a bittersweet moment for the families and supporters of Israeli hostages, living and dead. In the first phase of the ceasefire, 33 women, older men and the sick and wounded are due for release in the next six weeks in return for hundreds of Palestinian detainees and prisoners \u2013 but the future of the rest of the hostages depends on more negotiations.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the agreement, to free the remaining Israeli hostages in return for imprisoned Palestinians and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza are due to start 16 days into the agreement.",
      "The first big challenge is making sure that the ceasefire holds. Senior western diplomats fear that after the first phase of 42 days the war could resume.",
      "The Gaza war has had immense consequences across the Middle East. It did not, as many feared, lead to a general war in the region \u2013 the Biden Administration has claimed credit for that \u2013 but it has led to geostrategic upheaval.",
      "Hamas is still able to fight but it is a shadow of what it was. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister have been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. The International Court of Justice is investigating a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "After Hezbollah in Lebanon intervened in the war, it was, eventually, crushed by an Israeli offensive. That was a factor that led to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. Iran and Israel exchanged direct attacks \u2013 weakening Iran. Its network of allies and proxies that Tehran called the Axis of Resistance has been crippled.",
      "The Houthis in Yemen have halted much of the shipping between Europe and Asia that passes the Red Sea. Now reports say that they have announced their own ceasefire. Since they started attacking shipping early in the war they have said that only a ceasefire in Gaza would stop them.",
      "With luck, political will and hard diplomatic effort the ceasefire will hold despite inevitable violations. With luck, it can stop the killing and get Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees and prisoners back to their families.",
      "But after 15 months of war in Gaza, the conflict which has lasted more than a century is as bitter and intractable as ever.",
      "The ceasefire doesn't end the conflict. The consequences of so much destruction and death will be felt for a generation, at least."

      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid vacation per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

      "The African Union and other global powers believe territorial integrity is paramount. Recognising Somaliland could set off a chain reaction with separatists across the world demanding recognition for the territories they claim.",
      "Omar also highlighted concerns about a possible repeat of the first Trump administration's decision to withdraw from Somalia most American troops who have been fighting al-Shabab, regularly described as al-Qaeda's most successful affiliate.",
      "Under Joe Biden's presidency about 500 US troops have been stationed in Somalia - carrying out special operations and training an elite Somali force, Danab, which means \"Lightning\" and has proved more effective than the regular Somali army at rooting out al-Shabab.",
      "The Americans have an airbase at Baledogle, north-west of Mogadishu, and conduct regular airstrikes against Islamist insurgents.",
      "\"A withdrawal would create a significant security vacuum, emboldening terrorist groups and threatening the stability of not only Somalia but the broader Horn of Africa,\" Omar warned.",
      "The minister's remarks are in a similar vein but more measured than Somalia's response to a deal between Somaliland and Ethiopia whereby recognition would reportedly be granted in exchange for sea access.",
      "I received late-night calls from Somalis who said they were unable to sleep over the controversial proposal.",

      "\"People here are talking about a political earthquake. This is far more serious. It is a tsunami.\"",
      "Turkey has since mediated an end to the feud but the fact that Somalia recently signed a $600,000 (\u00a3492,000) a year deal with top Washington lobbying firm, the BGR Group, suggests it is worried about relations with the incoming Trump administration.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:37:52 GMT",
    "summary": "The country is deeply polarised by the president's attempt to impose martial law.",
    "story": [
      "Tears, dismayed cries and shocked faces: that was the reaction among the supporters of South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol outside his home on hearing that he had been arrested.",
      "It was a moment that had been in the making for weeks - ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after a dramatic standoff.",
      "Yet, when the news of his arrest came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty \u2013 and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament.",
      "\"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\"",
      "It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there.",
      "For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high.",
      "Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles.",
      "Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 \u2013 who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp.",
      "A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers.",
      "Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\"",
      "The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month.",
      "Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps.",
      "While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him.",

      "A dawn stand-off, a human wall and a failed arrest: South Korea enters uncharted territory",

      "The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation.",
      "The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil \u2013 along with the devastating Jeju Air crash on 29 December \u2013 has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere.",
      "Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December.",
      "He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings.",
      "Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant.",
      "On Wednesday, he released a video statement saying he would co-operate with the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) to avoid \"bloodshed\", while claiming their arrest warrant was not legally valid.",
      "It was a massive operation, which followed a warning from the CIO that the presidential security team could also be arrested if they tried to block Yoon's arrest again. Unlike last time, the CIO and police were successful in detaining Yoon, although it still took hours to negotiate.",
      "Once he left the presidential compound, the streets surrounding it began to empty. Protesters dispersed and the police barricades were removed.",
      "Some of Yoon's supporters moved to the CIO office where he is being questioned. They need another warrant to detain him for more than 48 hours.",
      "While Yoon's arrest has concluded the security standoff, it has not ended the rift that exists well beyond it in South Korea, which in recent decades has emerged as a leading global economy and beacon of democracy in Asia.",
      "\"Arresting the country's leader does not even make sense,\" declared one protester outside the presidential compound.",
      "An opposing voice countered: \"Executing the arrest warrant is a necessary step - Yoon attempted to undermine the country's democracy.\"",
      "Yoon himself continues to question whether the CIO has the right to arrest him \u2013 his lawyers say no, because insurrection is not a charge of corruption. But the CIO says that the insurrection is a form of abuse of power \u2013 a charge that is within their remit to investigate.",
      "What may appear to be a legal debate has veered deep into political territory, with both sides seeking to control the narrative.",
      "The swift impeachment of Yoon's immediate successor - Prime Minister Han Duck-soo \u2013 has already led to allegations that impeachment is being used as a political tool against Yoon's allies. And Yoon's impeachment trial getting under way this week has created more uncertainty.",
      "Public attention will be on what statements, if any, Yoon makes while he is detained or under trial.",

    "summary": "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.",
    "story": [
      "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.",
      "The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon.",
      "The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 to protect civilians and keep them out of harms way.",
      "On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid.",
      "Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify.",
      "In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area.",
      "Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war.",
      "BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month.",
      "We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May.",
      "Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza.",
      "Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones.",
      "He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\"",
      "\"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said.",
      "One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties.",
      "\"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said. \"We have been denied the true sense of security, with fear dominating our lives.\"",
      "As Israel does not allow foreign reporters access to Gaza - apart from highly controlled, escorted trips with its military - international media, including the BBC, is reliant on imagery gathered by Palestinian journalists and Gaza residents.",
      "To track attacks within the IDF's \"humanitarian area\", BBC Verify monitored Palestinian social media channels and official IDF channels on Instagram, Telegram and X. Reports of strikes that included verified imagery from within the boundaries of the zone were then cross-referenced with local media reports to determine a reported death toll.",
      "It's important to note that death tolls cannot be verified based solely on videos and social media reports. BBC Verify analysis excluded reports of fatalities where there wasn't verifiable imagery which confirmed the incident happened within the IDF-defined boundaries of the \"humanitarian area\".",
      "BBC Verify reviewed more than 300 videos and photos posted since May in the \"humanitarian zone\". While it is not always possible to distinguish between fighters and civilians, the footage shows scores of people, including women and children, being pulled from rubble. Some appeared lifeless, while others were severely burned or had significant limb injuries, alongside collapsed buildings, destroyed tents and burnt-out cars.",
      "Seven of the documented strikes are reported to have killed 20 or more people each, with the most deadly on 13 July resulting in more than 90 deaths, according to the Gaza health ministry, first responders and medics.",
      "The IDF later said Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif, was among the dead. Deif is accused of being one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks.",
      "Nine strikes occurred within 100m of buildings belonging to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, and four within 150m of the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.",
      "The IDF told BBC Verify the strikes were conducted \"against terrorists and terror infrastructures including rocket launchers, weapons warehouse and manufacturing sites, operational apartments, underground infrastructure, operational headquarters, and terrorists hideout.\"",
      "They also included links to six of their previously published statements about Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\".",
      "Residents in the zone also live under constant uncertainty. Including evacuation notices, the boundary of the \"humanitarian area\" has changed 20 times - and it has varied in size from around 7 km sq (2.7 sq miles) when it was first introduced to 72 km sq (27.8 sq miles) at its largest.",
      "The IDF said evacuation notices \"do not constitute as a reduction of the humanitarian zone. Once the danger has passed, the residents return\". But it's unclear how residents know it's safe to return, and the IDF has only twice posted to social media to explicitly say so. BBC Verify did not include strikes inside areas where evacuation notices were issued in our tally.",
      "While Israel's military has avoided using the term \"safe zone\", its statements have led civilians to interpret the \"humanitarian zone\" as such. IDF evacuation notices include language that tells civilians - like this one which was issued in mid-December - \"for your own safety, move immediately west to the humanitarian area\".",
      "It has also described the zone as being \"designated for humanitarian aid and shelters as part of the IDF's consistent efforts to protect the uninvolved population.\"",
      "But the UN and international humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza have said there's no such thing as a \"safe zone\" that is unilaterally enforced.",
      "Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said: \"We have said it so so many times. There is no safe zone in Gaza. No place is safe. No-one is safe. No place is spared.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 12:26:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.",
      "But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it?",
      "Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he is opposed to, even if the courts uphold it?",
      "TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew will certainly hope so - the BBC's US partner CBS is reporting he will attend Trump's inauguration alongside former presidents and family members on 20 January.",
      "And whatever happens to the social media platform, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he is against the law - which would come into force the day before he returns to office - asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "His incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \"preserve\" TikTok regardless of the court's ruling, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved.",
      "The precise mechanism for doing that is unclear, though - according to the Washington Post - one option under consideration is for Trump to sign an executive order which would suspend the enforcement the law.",
      "\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\" Mr Waltz said.",
      "Another option would be for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

      "\"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,\" a statement posted to Lynch's social media reads. \"We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "Lynch, who would have turned 79 on Monday, revealed in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung disease, after years of smoking.",
      "Lynch, who was born in Montana in 1946, was a writer, director and painter who studied at the American Film Institute. He first broke into the movie scene in 1977 when he turned his thesis project into his first feature film \"Eraserhead,\" a black-and-white surrealist indie film that quickly gained notoriety as a midnight movie.",
      "\"Eraserhead\" attracted the attention of producer Mel Brooks, who brought Lynch aboard to direct \"The Elephant Man,\" an adaptation of the life and times of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick, telling the younger director, \"You're a crazy man. You're hired.\"",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" earned Lynch his first of three Academy Award nominations for best director, followed by \"Blue Velvet\" in 1986 and \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, the latter also earning Lynch a best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, where he previously earned the festival's top prize \u2014 the Palme d'Or \u2014 for 1990's \"Wild at Heart.\"",
      "Lynch also directed the ill-fated 1984 movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune.\"",
      "But for many, Lynch's most famous contribution to pop culture was his collaboration with Mark Frost on ABC's primetime drama \"Twin Peaks,\"\u00a0 which hooked viewers immediately with its sui generis combination of mystery and quirk, spurring legions to tune in weekly to find out who murdered Laura Palmer, who was played by Sheryl Lee.",
      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",
      "In 2019, Lynch received an honorary Academy Award at the Motion Picture Academy's Governors Awards, and in 2012, he received honorary degrees from the American Film Institute.",

    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",
      "The two actors are also both represented by agency WME, which dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed a legal complaint that was a precursor to her lawsuit and the Times published its story on the fight surrounding the film.",

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died, the baseball commissioner's office confirmed to CBS News. He was 90.",
      "The Brewers announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker's family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson's late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker was a beloved member of the baseball community and a pillar of the sport in Wisconsin.",
      "When the Brewers clinched the NL Central title in 2024, manager Pat Murphy threw an arm around Uecker in the locker room, pulling him in tight as players white-knuckled their corks, ready to shower \"Mr. Baseball\" in Champagne.",
      "\"There is no one \u2014   there is no one \u2014   who epitomizes a champion the way this man does right here,\" Murphy proclaimed as the players chanted \"UUUUUECK.\"",
      "\"What an example for us to be with every single day \u2014   Bob Uecker.\"",
      "Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He'd last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\"Career highlights? I had two,\" he often joked. \"I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\"",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",
      "Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 12:53:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Food manufacturers will have until 2027 to stop using the dye. Drugmakers have until 2028.",
    "story": [
      "Companies say they are working to update their products to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's decision Wednesday to ban the artificial food dye Red 3, after the agency said it was revoking the additive's authorization over concerns it was causing cancer in rats.",
      "While the agency says that studies show the way Red 3 causes cancer in rats does not occur in humans, the law still requires additives that cause cancer in animals to be pulled from the market even if they are not proven to pose a risk to humans as well.",
      "The FDA says that food companies will have until Jan. 15, 2027 to stop using the dye. Drugmakers will have an extra year, until January 2028, to comply with the change.",
      "Which food brands have Red 3 in their products?",
      "Red 3, also known as erythrosine, Acid Red 51 or FD&C Red No. 3, is often used in candy. But other companies also use Red 3 to color a wide variety of products, from drinks to vegetarian meats, and will be forced to rework their recipes.",
      "Yoo-hoo's strawberry drink is being reformulated to be made without Red 3, the company told CBS News. \"The new formula will be on shelves before the end of the year,\" beverage giant Keurig Dr Pepper said in an email.",
      "Kellanova, which manufactures Pop-Tarts and MorningStar products that use Red 3, said it is working to \"ensure any impacted products are in compliance\" by 2027.",
      "A Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson said most of their recipes already do not include synthetic colors, including Red 3. For products that still use it, like Nesquik strawberry milk or Toll House Funfetti cookie dough, the spokesperson said they have \"already been actively removing\" the dye.",
      "Some Conagra Brands products, including its Marie Callender's birthday cake pie and Duncan Hines confetti cake mix, list Red 3 as an ingredient. A Conagra spokesperson said they are \"minimally impacted\" by the FDA's ruling, and are \"taking steps to remove it from a limited number\" of their products in time for the rule's deadline.",
      "Seasoning and condiments giant McCormick said it had also \"already begun the process of removing Red 3 prior to the FDA ruling\" on the dye. The spokesperson said McCormick has only \"very limited use of Red 3 in our branded retail products.\" Some of their products still listing Red 3 include vegan imitation bacon chips and Cake Mate red icing.",
      "A spokesperson from Dunkin' Donuts confirmed that some of its vegetarian bacon products contain the dye, but that version of the product is sold only in its 48 kosher locations. None of the company's other locations sell products with the dye.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerned over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",

      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

      "The\u00a0inspection records, released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests from The Associated Press and other news organizations, appear similar to some of the issues found at the Jarrett, Virginia, plant that was shuttered after at least 10 people died from Boar's Head products contaminated with listeria.",
      "The plants \u2014 located in New Castle, Indiana; Forrest City, Arkansas; and Peterburg, Virginia \u2014 were cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for issues such as mold on ceilings, floors and walls, \"unidentified slime\" and \"an abundance of insects.\" The problems cited by USDA inspectors at the three plants date back as far as 2019, according to the documents.",
      "Boar's Head didn't immediately respond to a request from CBS News for comment. The company told The Associated Press that the violations cited at the three factories \"do not meet our high standards.\" The company's remaining plants continue to operate under normal USDA oversight, Boar's Head added.",

      "\"I competed in Olympic weightlifting, I did powerlifting, bodybuilding, so I've been very active pretty much my entire life,\" Heath said.",
      "Access to special prosthetics",
      "Heath needed special prosthetics to remain active after his amputation, and he was able to get them through the Veterans Administration.",
      "Other amputees would have had to pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for those secondary prosthetics because they weren't covered by insurance.",
      "\"If I request a certain foot or a blade, I get that instantly because I'm a veteran,\" Heath said. \"That's how the 'So Everybody Can Move' initiative started, because I realized not everybody had the same access that I do.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 09:50:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Officials have blamed a new strain for this winter's surge in norovirus cases.",
    "story": [
      "This winter's wave of norovirus infections has reached levels that are now more than double last season's peak, in figures published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking the notorious stomach bug.",
      "Nearly 28% of norovirus tests run over the week of the New Year's holiday came back positive for the highly contagious virus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness like vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S.",
      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",
      "While norovirus rates always worsen during the colder months, in recent years most trends tracking norovirus did not reach their peak until March or April.",
      "That's different from seasons leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which scrambled many usual seasonal patterns of germs. During that time, norovirus outbreaks often reached peak levels as early as December and January.",
      "Experts say this year's early and steep surge of cases is being driven by a new strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a previous strain that had dominated previous waves of the virus in the U.S. for a decade.",
      "That new strain has been spotted everywhere around the country, including in many cruise ship outbreaks, a CDC official told CBS News. Lower population immunity to GII.17[P17] could explain this year's unusual wave of the virus.",
      "More than 7 in 10 outbreaks have been linked to this new norovirus strain this season, according to the latest CDC figures.",

      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

    "story": [
      "In a move to help close the pay gap between men and women in college sports, the NCAA will now pay Division I women's basketball teams who play in March Madness games starting this year.",
      "After a historic vote on Wednesday, women's teams will now receive \"performance units\" for every game they play in the NCAA Tournament. Met with a round of applause at the NCAA's convention in Nashville, Tennessee, the unanimous vote was the final buzzer-beater in establishing a pay structure for women competing in March Madness.",
      "The change comes as men's basketball teams have been a part of revenue-sharing plans for years. But with a surge in popularity surrounding women's basketball, the NCAA's Board of Governors voted unanimously for the proposal in August. Wednesday's vote solidified the details.",
      "Starting in the 2025 season, a combined $15 million will be awarded to the teams, which makes up 26% of the women's basketball media revenue deal. It will increase to $20 million for the 2026-27 fiscal year and reach $25 million starting with the 2027-28 fiscal year. The units earned will be paid out to the schools starting in 2026 on a rolling three-year basis.",
      "The longer a school stays in the tournament, the more units the school's conference receives. With a Final Four appearance, a team could bring its conference $1.26 million over the next three years. The revenue distribution plan for the women's tournament is similar to the men's.",
      "\"This is a historic day for women's sports, women's basketball and the NCAA,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"We have made investing in women's sports a priority, and today's vote means our members have the opportunity to do even more on campus to promote and support female athletes. I can't wait to see all the incredible things they do.\"",
      "Last year's women's national championship game drew in record attendance and also saw 18.7 million viewers tune in, becoming the most-watched women's college basketball game ever with an 89% increase from the 2023 championship game. It also outdrew the men's national championship game by 3 million viewers.",
      "Viewing records were set across all six rounds as fans watched outstanding players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark take on South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley and the undefeated Gamecocks. Other players who contributed to the boost in viewership were LSU's Angel Reese, USC's JuJu Watkins and UConn's Paige Bueckers.",
      "Bueckers, who is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 WNBA draft if she decides not to return to the Huskies for another year, said revenue sharing is a step in the right direction. \"I think that's huge, just for women's hoop, continuing to capitalize on what we've brought to the sport and what we do for just sport in general and entertainment,\" Bueckers told reporters.",
      "\"It's capitalizing on the momentum that's out there,\" UConn head coach Geno Auriemma said. \"It's a statement that they made today about where women's basketball fits into the big picture of college athletics.\"",

      "Worries about everyday expenses helped return President-elect Donald Trump to the White House. But with his second term quickly approaching, many U.S. adults are skeptical about his ability to bring down costs.",

      "Trump, who was named 2024 Person of the Year by Time Magazine, acknowledged in an interview with the publication that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",
      "Faith in Trump's ability to create jobs is a little higher \u2014 about 3 in 10 are extremely or very confident the Republican will make progress on this in 2025 \u2014 but the poll indicates that despite his sweeping promises about lowering prices, a substantial chunk of his own supporters don't have high confidence in his ability to quickly alleviate the economic pressures that continue to frustrate many households.",

      "Fed up with the economy, Americans turn to Trump",
      "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices",
      "Those tempered expectations haven't dampened Republicans' hopes for Trump's second presidential term, though. And Democrats' pessimism about his return to office is more muted than it was when he\u00a0exited\u00a0the White House in 2020. About 8 in 10 Republicans say Trump will be a \"great\" or \"good\" president in his second term, according to the poll.",
      "And while Democrats' assessments are much more negative \u2014 about 8 in 10 say he will be a \"poor\" or \"terrible\" president \u2014 they are less likely to say he'll be a \"terrible\" president in his second term than they were at the end of his\u00a0first.",
      "Much of the 2024 presidential campaign revolved around prices \u2014 whether President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was to blame for inflation and whether Trump could fix it. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results, showed that about 4 in 10 voters in the November election identified the economy and jobs as the most important issue facing the country and that about 6 in 10 of those voters cast their ballot for Trump.",

Less than half of Republicans are at least \"very\" confident that Trump will make progress on lowering food costs, housing costs or health care costs, although about 6 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to create jobs.",
      "Confidence in Trump's ability to handle the broader economic situation is also fairly low. Only about one-third of Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy and jobs. Nearly 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident, and about half are \"slightly confident\" or \"not at all confident.\"",

      "Health care costs",
      "But there are other policy areas where expectations for Trump aren't high across the board. Similar to the economy and jobs, about one-third of Americans are at least \"very\" confident in Trump's ability to handle immigration and national security, while about 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident and about half are \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" confident.",
      "Americans are especially skeptical of Trump's ability to bring down health care costs or handle the issue of health care at all, the poll found. Only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident in his ability to tackle health care issues, and 16% are confident in his ability to make progress on lowering health care costs.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would look at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. He has not offered a concrete plan of what his changes to the health care law would be, but he spent a lot of energy during his first term on efforts to dismantle it that were ultimately unsuccessful.",
      "Only about half of Republicans are extremely or very confident in Trump's ability to handle health care, and about one-third are at least very confident he'll make progress on lowering the cost of heath care.",
      "Trump's favorability remains steady",
      "Trump's favorability rating has remained steady through four indictments, a criminal conviction and two attempted assassinations, and the new survey shows that Americans' expectations for his second term match their assessment of his first four years in office. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults expect Trump will be a \"terrible\" or \"poor\" president in his second term, essentially unchanged from when he left the White House in 2021.",
      "But Republicans are expecting even bigger things from Trump this time, while Democrats' fears appear to be a little more muted. About half of Republicans say they think Trump will be a \"great\" president in his second term, while about 4 in 10 Republicans described him as a great president at the end of his first term. Democrats still overwhelmingly expect that Trump will be a \"terrible\" president, but that concern has lessened.",

    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "As disasters linked to climate change become more frequent in the U.S., homeowners across the country are paying the price through skyrocketing insurance costs \u2014 and not only in states like Florida and California that are considered most vulnerable to global warming.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires, which have decimated neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, are focusing attention on a mounting insurance crisis that is particularly acute in states at greatest risk of wildfires, such as California, Colorado, Texas and Oregon. But the problem is reaching into almost every region of the U.S., including the Midwest, the Northeast and the Mountain states, according to analyses of insurance data.",
      "Research shows that climate change is heightening the conditions that lead to fire-conducive weather, including drying out vegetation and constraining water supplies. Such conditions are in turn prolonging wildfire season as well magnifying the size and intensity of blazes.",
      "In 2024, there were 27 weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages, ranging from hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to wildfires, drought and hail, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Between 2020 and 2024, the average annual cost of those events topped $149 billion \u2014 more than double the annual average cost of roughly $65 billion between 1980 and 2024.",
      "\"Serious pocketbook issue\"",
      "The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024\u00a0research\u00a0from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.",
      "Such costs have surged even more in parts of the U.S. prone to the kind of natural disasters that experts link to climate change. Homeowners in these states have seen their insurance premiums soar by about 50% over that three-year period, according to Benjamin Keys, a professor real estate and finance at Wharton and a co-author of the 2024 study.",
      "Yet even property owners in states considered less vulnerable to climate disasters are now grappling with increased insurance costs and dropped policies \u2014 issues that threaten to undermine property values.",
      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and these places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",
      "Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration.",

      "\"Need to act fast here. All neighbors houses burning. Will pay any amount,\" he added.",
      "City and county fire departments have been stretched thin, as they continue to battle the wind-fueled fires across Los Angeles that as of Monday have scorched more than 60 square miles\u00a0of land, killing at least 24 people and displacing tens of thousands. Municipal resources, like fire hydrants, have run dry in some areas.",
      "Those who can afford to do so are reaching out to private firefighting crews in hopes of saving their homes from the furious wildfires.",

      "Some of the company's firefighters also work for county fire departments. Others are retired from active duty, according to the company, which offers different levels of protective services ranging in price from $2,500 to $14,000.",
      "Clients called on All Risk Shield before the fires reached their properties to try and protect their homes from encroaching flames.",
      "\"We deployed our teams to these high-risk properties we knew the fire was going to possibly reach, and we were on the ground before the fire even made it to that area,\" Torres said. That included fighting fires from homeowners' properties, using residents' resources like pools, spas, rainwater tanks and water tanks to extinguish flames, in addition to the company's own fire retardants. Torres noted that the company never relies on municipal resources, like fire hydrants, to serve private clients.",
      "He added that the company operates completely independently from Los Angeles County Fire Department, but that \"indirectly, we are helping each other.\"",
      "\"Our teams have been working alongside municipal firefighters in this event,\" he said.",
      "The National Wildfire Suppression Association (NWSA), which represents private firefighter services, said that contractors often join forces with local, state and federal firefighting efforts. Contracts with private home and land owners account for a small share of business for these types of companies; the bulk of contracts comes from providing supplemental personnel and equipment to local, state and federal firefighting efforts, according to the NWSA.",
      "Fire prevention and mitigation contractors also do work for insurance companies performing tasks to reduce fire risks, such as clearing undergrowth, trimming or removing trees near homes, and applying fire retardants. A growing segment of the industry, this work typically occurs during the off-season and not in response to active fires.",
      "An \"all hands on deck\" situation",
      "The association, which represents 369 private firefighting companies across the country, confirmed that its members have directed personnel and other resources toward containing the Los Angeles wildfires. Combined, its member organizations can pool up to 11,000 professionally trained wildland firefighters.",
      "\"The size and scale of these fires and the devastation left in their wake require an all-hands-on-deck approach to suppression, restoration and future prevention, including state, federal and private resources,\" the NWSA said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",

      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",

    "title": "Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas is allowing three other states to pursue a challenge seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in Texas ruled Thursday that three other states can move ahead with their effort to roll back federal rules and make it harder for people across the U.S. to access the abortion drug mifepristone.",
      "The states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri made the request in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. The only judge based there is Matthew Kacsmaryk, a nominee of former President Donald Trump who previously ruled in favor of a challenge to the pill's approval.",
      "The states want the federal Food and Drug Administration to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone and require that it be used only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the current limit of 10 weeks. They also want to require three in-person doctor office visits instead of none to get the drug.",
      "That's because, the states argue, efforts to provide access to the pills \"undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state law enforcement,\" according to court documents.",
      "Meanwhile, Kacsmaryk said they shouldn't be automatically discounted from suing in Texas just because they're outside the state.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that the case should have been settled when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to mifepristone last year, where the justices issued a narrow ruling finding that abortion opponents who first filed the case lacked the legal right to sue.",
      "Kacsmaryk's decision \"has left the door open for extremist politicians to continue attacking medication abortion in his courtroom,\" the ACLU said.",
      "The ruling comes days before Trump begins his second term as president, so his administration will likely be representing the FDA in the case. Trump has repeatedly said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government, though he's also stressed on the campaign trail that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion in 2022.",
      "In the years since, abortion opponents have increasingly targeted abortion pills, largely due to most U.S. abortions being carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures. So far, at least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have seen Republicans introduce bills aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Previously, Kacsmaryk sided with a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations that wanted the FDA to be forced to rescind entirely its approval of mifepristone in 2000.",
      "Yet the states are pursuing a narrower challenge. Rather than target the approval entirely, they sought to undo a series of FDA updates that have eased access.",
      "But while the states' leaders are pushing to severely limit access to the drugs, voters in Missouri sent a different message in November when they approved a ballot measure to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. In Idaho, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. In Kansas, abortion is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy.",
      "Across the U.S., 13 states under Republican legislative control bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four more ban it after the first six weeks \u2014 before women often know they're pregnant.",
      "Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws seeking to shield from investigations and prosecutions the doctors who prescribe the pills via telehealth appointments and mail them to patients in states with bans. Those prescriptions are a major reason a study found that residents of states with bans are getting abortions in about the same numbers as they were before the bans were in place.",
      "Mifepristone is usually used in combination with a second drug for medication abortion, which has accounted for more than three-fifths of all abortions in the U.S. since the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",

      "The incoming Trump administration is planning to install Texas' border czar as head of U.S. Border Patrol, replacing the career official who currently leads the agency in charge of stopping the illicit movement of migrants and drugs.",
      "Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, two sources familiar with the move told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Banks would replace current Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, a 28-year veteran career official at the agency. Owens is set to retire from government service in April, two U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "In an internal message sent to agents Thursday and obtained by CBS News, Owens said the opportunity to serve as Border Patrol chief was \"the highest honor I have ever received.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, I will leave with a profound sense of optimism about its future and that of our country,\" Owens wrote. \"I will take comfort knowing that you are on our frontline, standing between the innocent and the evil.\"",
      "Banks' appointment would be a departure from the general practice of Border Patrol having leaders that are career government officials, not political appointees.",
      "A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, Banks has been a key player in Texas' aggressive effort to counter what the state has argued is the Biden administration's failure to secure the southern border amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "Since March 2021, Texas has bussed tens of thousands of migrants to major Democratic-led U.S. cities, deployed the National Guard to fortify the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and assigned troopers to arrest migrants on criminal trespassing charges.",
      "It also tried to enact its own immigration law to arrest and jail migrants suspected of entering the country illegally, though that measure is currently held up in court.",
      "As Border Patrol chief, Banks would oversee the agents in green uniforms responsible for apprehending migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally between official entry points, or those who reach Florida and other coastal sectors by sea. Over the past years, discontent among rank-and-file agents has grown over disagreements with the Biden administration's immigration policies.",
      "One U.S. official said Banks is expected to join the second Trump administration in some capacity soon after Trump is inaugurated, alongside Rodney Scott, who the president-elect has tapped to be his CBP commissioner.",
      "Scott was a Border Patrol chief himself, appointed under the first Trump administration, until he was ousted by the Biden administration in the spring of 2021. As CBP commissioner, Scott would oversee Border Patrol, but also customs and immigration officials at airports, sea ports and land crossings. That position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Beyond Banks and Scott, the incoming Trump administration also plans to install Tom Homan, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, as its border czar, a new White House position. Homan is expected to play a key role in carrying out what Trump has promised will be the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "During the first three years of the Biden administration, CBP reported record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, and officials struggled at times to contain mass illegal crossings. But unlawful border crossings have since plunged to a four-year low due to asylum limits President Biden enacted in June, and Mexico's efforts to stop migrants from trekking north.",

      "\"The Court may announce opinions on the homepage beginning at 10 a.m.,\" a notice on the\u00a0court's website said, without specifying what case or cases might be decided. \"The Court will not take the Bench.\"",
      "The law would cut TikTok off from U.S. app stores and hosting services if it does not cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, before the Jan. 19 deadline.",
      "The Supreme Court seemed likely to upload the law when it heard arguments over TikTok's legal challenge last week, with the justices seeming sympathetic to the government's claims that China could use TikTok to collect a vast amount of data on its American users and spy on them.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the potential Supreme Court decision is \"enormously consequential\" for the platform's 170 million users in the U.S. and their free speech rights.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Sunday, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said last week. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "In April, Congress swiftly passed the bipartisan legislation, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as part of a foreign aid package, and it was signed into law by President Biden. It gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, with the possibility of a 90-day extension if a sale were in progress by the January deadline. Absent a sale, TikTok loses access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S.",
      "The law would take effect one day before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump, who attempted to prohibit the app during his first term over national security concerns, has since said he wants to \"save\" the app and has credited it with helping him win over more youth voters.",
      "\"We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,\" Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday. \"It's been a great platform for him and his campaign.\"",

    "summary": "The Florida attorney general will serve as U.S. senator until the next general election in 2026 when the seat returns to the ballot.",
    "story": [
      "MIAMI \u2014   Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody will take Marco Rubio's U.S. Senate seat, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday, making her the second woman to represent the Sunshine State in the congressional chamber.",
      "Under Florida law, it's up to the governor to pick a U.S. Senate seat replacement after Rubio was\u00a0tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to be his next secretary of state. Moody will serve as senator until the next general election in 2026 when the seat returns to the ballot.",
      "On Thursday, DeSantis praised Moody as a key player in his political battles, a \"law and order\" prosecutor who is prepared to help Trump \"secure and shut the border,\" hinder inflation and overhaul what the Florida governor described as a federal bureaucracy that has \"run amok.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to show up and fight for this nation and fight for [President-elect] Trump to deliver his America First agenda on day one,\" Moody said.",
      "\"The only way to return this country to the people, the people who govern it, is to make sure we have a strong Congress doing its job, passing laws and actually approving the regulations that these unelected bureaucrats are trying to cram down on the American people,\" Moody added.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Moody and why her appointment is significant:",
      "Florida through and through",
      "Moody, 49, is a fifth-generation Floridian who was born and raised in Plant City, a suburb of Tampa. She is also a three-time graduate of the University of Florida, earning her bachelor's and master's degrees in accounting and law, along with her Juris Doctor.",
      "She also earned a master's in international law from the College of Law at Stetson University. In her youth, Moody was named \"queen\" of her hometown's\u00a0Florida Strawberry Festival in 1993.",
      "Moody and her husband, Justin Duralia, the deputy chief of the Plant City Police Department, share two sons.",
      "Career in Florida law and the courts system",
      "Moody\u00a0began her career with the law firm Holland & Knight, where she practiced commercial litigation.",
      "In her spare time, she volunteered to assist domestic violence victims seeking protection in court, according to her biography on the Florida attorney general's website.",
      "She then went on to join the U.S. Attorney General's Office in the Middle District of Florida, the federal court in the 11th Circuit, where she prosecuted drug, firearm and fraud offenses. During her time as a federal prosecutor, Moody was commended by federal agencies for her \"prosecutorial excellence\" and initiative in drug law enforcement, DeSantis said.",
      "She was also recognized by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for leading \"Operation Round-Up,\" a targeted prosecution of violent and repeat offenders.",
      "At the age of 31, Moody became the youngest judge in Florida history when she was elected as Circuit Court judge of the Thirteenth Judicial District in Hillsborough County.",
      "During her time as judge, she founded the Attorney Ad Litem program, recruiting volunteer attorneys to stand in the place of parents who did not appear in court with their children. Moody also developed a mentoring program for at-risk children within the juvenile delinquency system.",
      "From prosecutor to politician",
      "Moody was elected Florida attorney general in 2018, defeating state Rep. Sean Shaw and succeeding Pam Bondi, who is now going through confirmation hearings as Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general. During her campaign, Moody pledged to voters that she would be a prosecutor and not a politician.",
      "As the state's attorney general, Moody was instrumental in defending DeSantis' conservative agenda in court, joining and leading other Republican states' challenges to policies enacted by the Biden administration.",
      "Along with DeSantis, Moody boosted her political profile during the COVID-19 pandemic, calling on the U.S. to \"hold China accountable\" for the outbreak.  She has also sued the Biden administration over several issues, including changes to immigration law enforcement, student loan forgiveness and employer COVID-19 vaccination mandates.",
      "\"I'm happy to say we've had an attorney general that is somebody that has acted time and time again to support the values that we all share,\" DeSantis said. \"We in Florida established our state as a beachhead of liberty, as the free state of Florida. And she was with us every step of the way.\"",
      "Moody was also among the state attorneys general to sign on to the lawsuit backed by Trump that was aimed at overturning Joe Biden's election victory in 2020.",
      "In the past year, Moody has filed lawsuits and joined lawsuits to take on the \"weaponization of law enforcement\" that targeted Trump, taking on special counsel Jack Smith and the New York Attorney General's Office with their cases against the then-former president.",
      "DeSantis said Moody also played an \"integral part\" in Florida's efforts to defend the state from China and its influence, particularly in the controversy surrounding a law that prevented people \"domiciled\" in China from purchasing Florida land, state pension investments in Chinese companies and alleged Chinese espionage through social media.",
      "Moody also led Florida's investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump in Palm Beach County in September of 2024.",
      "During the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season, Moody fought against FEMA after reports came out that an agency director allegedly told agents to deny aiding and helping Trump supporters who were impacted by Hurricane Milton in Central Florida.",
      "Moody also fought unsuccessfully to keep Amendment 4 \u2014 Florida's abortion access measure \u2014 off the 2024 ballot, saying proponents were waging \"a war\" to protect the procedure. The amendment did go before voters in November but failed to obtain the 60% approval needed to pass.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump wants to make Hollywood \"bigger, better and stronger\" and has cast Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone as stars of what he is calling his \"Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California.\"",

      "\"It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "He also called the trio special envoys. Special ambassadors and envoys are typically chosen to respond to troubled hot spots like the Middle East, not California.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday, Gibson said he \"got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised. Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can. Any chance the position comes with an Ambassador's residence?\"",
      "Gibson's Malibu home was destroyed in the wildfires which scorched the Los Angeles area.",
      "U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and, in the past week, the ongoing wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% from 2021, according to data from ProdPro.",
      "In the greater L.A. area, productions were down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, the lowest since 2020. This past October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed expanding California's Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million. Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have used tax incentives to lure film and TV productions to their cities. Actor Mark Wahlberg is even making plans for a Las Vegas production hub.",
      "It's unclear what exactly Gibson, Voight and Stallone will be doing in this effort to bring productions back to the U.S. Representatives for Voight and Stallone did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
      "Trump's decision to select the actors as his chosen \"ambassadors\" underscores his preoccupations with the 1980s and '90s, when he was a rising tabloid star in New York, and Gibson and Stallone were among the biggest movie stars in the world.",
      "Stallone is a frequent guest at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club and introduced him at a gala in November shortly after the election.",
      "\"When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world. Because without him, you could imagine what the world would look like,\" Stallone told the crowd. \"Guess what? We got the second George Washington. Congratulations!\"",
      "The decision also reflects Trump's willingness to overlook his supporters' most controversial statements.",
      "Gibson's reputation has been altered in Hollywood since 2006, when he went on an antisemitic rant while being arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. But he's also continued to work in mainstream movies and directed the upcoming Wahlberg thriller \"Flight Risk.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

A 2022 law passed by Congress, and signed by President Biden, required a plaque to be placed on the west front of the Capitol complex by March 2023. Republican House leaders, all of whom are closely aligned with Trump, have yet to erect the plaque, nor have they offered any timetable to do so.",

      "Among the House Democrats pressing for the plaque is Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado who was among those trapped in the upper level of the House Chamber as rioters laid siege to the Capitol. Crow and colleagues wrote to Johnson, \"Every day Congress fails to live up to our promised actions, we do a disservice to our men and women in uniform who help protect members of Congress, congressional staff, our constituents, and the American people.\"",
      "Other Democrats who have signed the letter to Johnson include former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, some members of the House Jan. 6 select committee and other Democrats who were trapped in close proximity to the violent mob.",

      "The letter from House Democrats said a House administrator had testified that the \"plaque was complete,\" and said its placement \"continues to await action from Speaker Johnson.\"",
      "More than 140 police officers were injured during the Capitol attack. Several others died by suicide in the days after the riot.",
      "Several Democrats and staffers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 have accused Republicans of bowing to Trump by downplaying or ignoring the violence of the siege. Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who unsuccessfully ran for a U.S. House seat in Maryland as a Democrat last year, told CBS News, \"Speaker Johnson has not and cannot provide any reason.\"",
      "\"At this point he is doing nothing but obstructing,\" Dunn said.",
      "Democrats have been pressing House leaders about the plaque delay for months without success. In May, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was on the House Jan. 6 select committee investigating the assault, wrote to Johnson for answers about the \"failure to install the plaque.\"",
      "Lofgren told CBS News, \"I sent Speaker Johnson a polite letter inquiring about the delay last May, and he never answered. My office followed up, and we were first referred to a vague press answer. Then, crickets\"",

    "story": [
      "Quietly, just before the calendar turned for the new year, an already whopping debt tentatively owed by President-elect Donald Trump and co-defendants in his New York civil fraud case hit an eye-popping, interest-accumulating milestone: half a billion dollars.",
      "Trump, two of his sons and a former executive at his company were ordered in February 2024 to pay $364 million in \"ill-gotten gains\" and millions more in interest dating back years. The figure, which was then $464 million, continued to accrue more than $114,000 in interest per day. The judgment is on appeal.",
      "The total crossed $500 million on Dec. 29, and stands at more than $502 million on Thursday, a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James confirmed.",
      "Trump, who would personally owe about $490 million of that sum, has banked on a reprieve from New York's mid-level Appellate Division, First Department court. During arguments in September, at least two of five justices on the appeals panel seemed skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\"",
      "But as the defendants await the panel's decision, which is expected early this year, interest has continued to pile up. The court typically releases opinions on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and the Trump case was not among the batch released today.",
      "That means Trump will likely be sworn in as president on Monday with a debt to the state of New York larger than the combined proposed 2025 budgets for New York's sixth and seventh largest cities, Albany and New Rochelle.",
      "Trump has raged against the debt and the case, in which a judge concluded he and his company manipulated spreadsheets provided to accountants to juice valuations provided to banks and insurers. The result, James' office argued and Judge Arthur Engoron concluded, was that Trump and his company received more favorable terms on loans and insurance deals that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.",
      "The growing total they may owe the state, known as disgorgement, is equal to the amount Engoron concluded they profited through the scheme, plus interest.",
      "During a later 2023 bench trial in the case, Trump was called to the stand, where he cast blame on his employees and outside accountants, but said his books were compiled accurately. He claimed that, far from overvaluing his assets and net worth, his company \"underestimated\" them.",
      "On top of the half billion owed in the New York civil case, Trump also owes more than $88 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll, after jurors in 2023 and 2024 found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation.",
      "He has denied all allegations in the New York and Carroll cases, and is pursuing appeals in all three.",

      "Trump, who was named 2024 Person of the Year by Time Magazine, acknowledged in an interview with the publication that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",
      "Faith in Trump's ability to create jobs is a little higher \u2014 about 3 in 10 are extremely or very confident the Republican will make progress on this in 2025 \u2014 but the poll indicates that despite his sweeping promises about lowering prices, a substantial chunk of his own supporters don't have high confidence in his ability to quickly alleviate the economic pressures that continue to frustrate many households.",

      "Fed up with the economy, Americans turn to Trump",
      "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices",
      "Those tempered expectations haven't dampened Republicans' hopes for Trump's second presidential term, though. And Democrats' pessimism about his return to office is more muted than it was when he\u00a0exited\u00a0the White House in 2020. About 8 in 10 Republicans say Trump will be a \"great\" or \"good\" president in his second term, according to the poll.",
      "And while Democrats' assessments are much more negative \u2014 about 8 in 10 say he will be a \"poor\" or \"terrible\" president \u2014 they are less likely to say he'll be a \"terrible\" president in his second term than they were at the end of his\u00a0first.",
      "Much of the 2024 presidential campaign revolved around prices \u2014 whether President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was to blame for inflation and whether Trump could fix it. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results, showed that about 4 in 10 voters in the November election identified the economy and jobs as the most important issue facing the country and that about 6 in 10 of those voters cast their ballot for Trump.",
      "As Trump takes office, though, the poll shows that many Americans don't anticipate that he will be able to immediately bring costs down. That includes some of his own supporters. Less than half of Republicans are at least \"very\" confident that Trump will make progress on lowering food costs, housing costs or health care costs, although about 6 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to create jobs.",
      "Confidence in Trump's ability to handle the broader economic situation is also fairly low. Only about one-third of Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy and jobs. Nearly 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident, and about half are \"slightly confident\" or \"not at all confident.\"",

      "Health care costs",
      "But there are other policy areas where expectations for Trump aren't high across the board. Similar to the economy and jobs, about one-third of Americans are at least \"very\" confident in Trump's ability to handle immigration and national security, while about 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident and about half are \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" confident.",
      "Americans are especially skeptical of Trump's ability to bring down health care costs or handle the issue of health care at all, the poll found. Only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident in his ability to tackle health care issues, and 16% are confident in his ability to make progress on lowering health care costs.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would look at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. He has not offered a concrete plan of what his changes to the health care law would be, but he spent a lot of energy during his first term on efforts to dismantle it that were ultimately unsuccessful.",
      "Only about half of Republicans are extremely or very confident in Trump's ability to handle health care, and about one-third are at least very confident he'll make progress on lowering the cost of heath care.",
      "Trump's favorability remains steady",
      "Trump's favorability rating has remained steady through four indictments, a criminal conviction and two attempted assassinations, and the new survey shows that Americans' expectations for his second term match their assessment of his first four years in office. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults expect Trump will be a \"terrible\" or \"poor\" president in his second term, essentially unchanged from when he left the White House in 2021.",
      "But Republicans are expecting even bigger things from Trump this time, while Democrats' fears appear to be a little more muted. About half of Republicans say they think Trump will be a \"great\" president in his second term, while about 4 in 10 Republicans described him as a great president at the end of his first term. Democrats still overwhelmingly expect that Trump will be a \"terrible\" president, but that concern has lessened.",

    "summary": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Ashley Moody, the state's attorney general, will replace Marco Rubio in the Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody will replace Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, in the Senate.",
      "\"Today I am proud to announce that I am selecting our attorney general, Ashley Moody, to serve as our next U.S. senator,\" DeSantis said at a news conference in Orlando, saying she's \"honorably served our people\" during her time as the state's top law enforcement officer.",
      "\"These are always significant appointments, but I think right now appointments like these are more significant than ever,\" DeSantis said. \"This is a time for action and a time for Washington, D.C., to deliver results for the American people.\"",
      "DeSantis called Trump's victory in the 2024 election \"remarkable,\" saying he earned a \"mandate for change.\"",
      "\"No more business as usual in Washington, D.C.,\" DeSantis added.",
      "The Florida governor emphasized border security as part of that mandate, saying Florida would be working with the Trump administration to make sure immigration laws are enforced.",
      "DeSantis outlined his criteria for the Senate appointment Thursday, saying he wanted someone who would deliver on Trump's agenda, commit to cutting spending, understand that federal bureaucracy has \"run amok\" and understand \"the fight against illegal immigration.\"",
      "Moody, 49, has served as Florida's attorney general since 2019. DeSantis touted Moody's \"impressive resume\" as a commercial litigator and federal prosecutor, noting that she became Florida's youngest circuit court judge in 2007. The Florida governor said Moody has been someone who \"has acted time and time again to support the values that we all share,\" from addressing the opioid and fentanyl crisis to illegal immigration and human trafficking.",
      "DeSantis also pointed to Moody's track record of supporting the president-elect, noting that she signed on to lawsuits to \"take on the weaponization of law enforcement that targeted then-candidate Donald Trump,\" took on special counsel Jack Smith and fought back against New York Attorney General Letitia James. He also noted that Moody led the state investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Moody, speaking after DeSantis on Thursday, said she would \"bring the same persistence and passion and tenacity as a United States senator that I have brought as Florida's attorney general.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to show up and fight for this nation and fight for President Trump to deliver the America first agenda on day one,\" Moody said, while pledging to rein in \"out of control federal agencies\" and bring down spending.",
      "Senate vacancies in Florida are filled by an appointment by the governor, who selects a replacement to serve until the next statewide election. DeSantis' appointment means Moody will be expected to hold the seat until a special election can be held in 2026. The winner of the 2026 election would serve the remainder of Rubio's term, meaning that person would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "The announcement comes after months of speculation about who could fill the seat. A number of possibilities have emerged for DeSantis to appoint, including Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who until recently was the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Last month, she said she was removing herself from consideration.",
      "DeSantis' chief of staff James Uthmeier and Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez had also been floated, as had former Florida House Speaker Jose Olivia. DeSantis said Thursday that he also thinks highly of Reps. Kat Cammack and Cory Mills, whom he said had also been in the mix, but he didn't want to jeopardize the narrow House Republican majority. He noted that Uthmeier would become Florida's new attorney general.",
      "Trump tapped Rubio, who has represented Florida in the Senate since 2011, for the Cabinet post in November. The 53-year-old China hawk has extensive foreign policy experience and is expected to have among the smoothest paths to confirmation in the Senate. He appeared at his confirmation hearing this week, and is expected to resign from the Senate when Trump is sworn in next week.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to reclaim the Oval Office, his election gains among men have become a key focus. These gains \u2014 particularly among young and Latino men \u2014 suggest dissatisfaction with the way Democrats have addressed economic and societal changes affecting men.",
      "During the 2024 presidential election, much of the attention was placed on the female vote, as Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned to be the first female president and many high-profile women backed her campaign.",
      "However, as it turned out, many men had significant motivations to vote.",
      "\"A lot of men were sick of being told they are terrible and there is nothing they can do, and that's I think the huge mistake that Democrats made,\" said Kat Timpf on the Fox News program \"Gutfeld!\"",
      "How Trump's campaign appealed to issues men face",
      "Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of \"Of Boys and Men,\" sees this frustration as part of some larger trends for men.",
      "\"They have come to believe that the progressive agenda on behalf of women has felt it necessary to somehow either dismiss or even denigrate men \u2014 and they're over it,\" Reeves said. He also pointed out a troubling trend among young men, citing a survey where two-thirds reported feeling like no one knows them very well, and 15% had no close friends.",
      "Reeves also discussed the deeper issues men face, including stagnant wages and disproportionate death rates from suicide and overdose.",
      "\"The unwillingness of anybody on the center-left to just have a straightforward conversation about men's mental health, about male employment, about male wages has created a gigantic vacuum in our culture and in our politics,\" Reeves added.",
      "Republicans, according to Reeves, have filled this void. Through male-dominated social media platforms sometimes referred to as \"The Manosphere,\" including \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, conservative figures have successfully reached men, especially through sports and popular culture.",
      "\"We've dealt with \u2013 especially in the last three-and-a-half years \u2014 a complete dismemberment of what it is to be a man,\" said Tyrus, a conservative commentator, in an interview with Trump \u2014 a sentiment with which Trump agreed.",
      "Trump's appeal to men contrasts sharply with the left's more progressive stance on gender. Conservative commentator Michael Knowles said, \"Trump appealed to men because he appealed to men. He actually campaigned to try to win their votes.\"",
      "Knowles feels the left's approach has gone too far in disregarding men's issues.",
      "Faiz Shakir, chief political advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders, acknowledged Republicans have done a better job in connecting with men, even as he pointed out the Biden administration's focus on factory jobs and infrastructure has been beneficial to men. He suspects Trump will eventually take credit for these achievements.",
      "The growing divide between the left and right over how men are perceived in society remains a critical issue heading into the next election.",
      "Reeves warns against relying on the conventional wisdom, saying that \"if there's a problem, there has to be a villain.\" He says we can't blame either feminism or the women's movement for the challenges men face.",
      "\"This is definitely not the fault of women ... But the problem sometimes on the other side, on progressive left side, has been to say that, by definition, men can't have problems because men are the problem.\"",

It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public.

He emphasized the critical role artificial intelligence will play in the future, and said the U.S. \u2014 not China \u2014 must lead the way in this field.",

      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, a role she held for two terms.",
      "\"If confirmed as the next attorney general of the United States, my overriding objective will be to return the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe and vigorously prosecuting criminals,\" Bondi said in her opening statement.",
      "Bondi said her time as a local prosecutor framed her goals for the Justice Department, which she described as \"getting back to the basics\" of combating crime and reducing recidivism.",
      "Republicans on the committee largely focused on Bondi's decades of crimefighting experience as a local prosecutor, and later as Florida attorney general. They claimed the Justice Department has been \"weaponized\" in recent years for political reasons, pointing to the prosecutions of Trump that have been dropped since the election.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the committee's top Democrat, noted Bondi's experience, but said it is Trump who has vowed to use the Justice Department to target his political enemies. Durbin said he wants assurances that Bondi would keep the Justice Department independent, and would be willing to say \"no\" to Trump. Trump clashed with his two attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, over decisions they made in his first term.",
      "Durbin asked Bondi if she accepted that Trump lost the election in 2020, a fact that he and many of his prominent supporters have not publicly acknowledged. Bondi stopped short of doing so Wednesday.",
      "\"There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024,\" Bondi said. Bondi told Durbin that she \"accept[s] the results\" of the 2020 election but declined to say outright that Mr. Biden won.",
      "Durbin asked if Bondi would support pardons for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Bondi said, if asked, she would review potential pardons on a \"case by case basis,\" adding: \"I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, asked Bondi if she would \"be willing to resign if ordered to do something improper.\"",
      "\"Senator, I wouldn't work at a law firm, I wouldn't be a prosecutor, I wouldn't be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out, of course I would not do that,\" Bondi said. \"That's one of the main things you learn as a young prosecutor, is to do the right thing.\"",
      "Later, she told Coons she and the president-elect have not discussed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden \u2014 a threat Trump has made. Throughout the hearing, she argued she would keep the Justice Department independent from the White House, including by upholding a department policy limiting contacts with White House officials.",
      "Bondi was repeatedly pressed by Democrats about whether she would target perceived Trump foes, including Cheney and Smith, who led the dual federal investigations against Trump. During one particularly heated exchange, she declined to say if she knew of any factual predicate for investigating Cheney, and told California Sen. Adam Schiff his concerns are misplaced.",
      "\"You're all so worried about Liz Cheney, senator, you know what we should be worried about? The crime rate in California right now is through the roof,\" she said.",
      "Bondi was also asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, about the reauthorization of Section 702, a government intelligence collection tool that has come under fire from some Republicans in Congress. She said she would take a look at the issue and called Section 702 a \"very important tool.\"",
      "Bondi's nomination",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee was one of several taking place before GOP-led panels this week as Trump prepares to begin his second term in office. Republicans have indicated they plan to give substantial deference to Trump as he fills out the top ranks of his administration and are aiming to install key Cabinet officials to their posts soon after the president-elect is inaugurated Monday.",
      "Bondi spent the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, and she is not expected to face significant hurdles in the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Durbin accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm and said he was concerned Bondi will prioritize fealty to Trump over loyalty to the Constitution. He met with Bondi last week.",
      "Bondi was term-limited in her position as Florida's attorney general and left office in 2019. While in office, she spearheaded lawsuits against the Obama administration, challenging the Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare \u2014 and then-President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "She went on to serve as an attorney and lobbyist at the firm Ballard Partners. There, she represented large corporations like General Motors, Amazon, Uber and the American Institute Against Human Trafficking, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying. And she submitted a registration with the federal government to lobby on behalf of Qatar \"regarding Qatari relations with U.S. government officials, U.S. business entities, and non-governmental audiences, in dealing with matters pertaining to combating human trafficking.\"",
      "At her hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"very proud of the work that I did\" with Qatar, telling Durbin her work was focused on \"anti-human trafficking efforts related to the World Cup.\"",
      "\"I was registered as FARA along with many members of my firm. That was the sole portion of my representation for Qatar,\" she said, referencing a federal law that requires lobbyists who work for foreign countries to register with the government.",
      "During Trump's first term, Bondi briefly left her lobbying position to serve as a member of his defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats. She defended Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Mr. Biden.",
      "The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstructing a congressional investigation, making him just the third U.S. president to ever be impeached. The Republican-led Senate then acquitted him following a trial, where Bondi was part of the team representing Trump.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Bondi spearheaded legal efforts to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and pushed the false claim that Trump won the state. She was asked about that work in Wednesday's hearing.",
      "\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened?\" Bondi said. \"No one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election integrity in our country. We should all want our elections to be free and fair, and the rules and the law to be followed.\"",
      "Bondi was also among the Trump allies who traveled to New York and spoke out in defense of the president-elect early last year during his \"hush money\" criminal trial. A jury convicted Trump on 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in May and he was sentenced last week.",
      "After the Justice Department brought criminal charges against Trump in 2023, Bondi told Fox News, \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them.\"",
      "If confirmed, she will now lead that department and will have the power to look into various aspects of the investigations into Trump that were led by Smith. She will also oversee the numerous law enforcement components under the Justice Department, including the FBI and the ATF, two organizations that have been targets of the president-elect and his allies.",
      "Bondi will also oversee implementation of aspects of Trump's agency and lead the department that will defend the president-elect's actions in federal court.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:15:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Conservation groups are concerned that the endangered right whale is vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration signals more support for marine industries.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government is withdrawing a proposal that would\u00a0require more ships to slow down\u00a0in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The move in the waning days of the Biden administration will leave the endangered North Atlantic right whale vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration is signaling a shift from environmental conservation to support for marine industries, conservation groups said. But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and\u00a0its population has plummeted\u00a0in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\"While we've been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we've watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\" Brogan said. \"And we've watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\"",
      "Thousands of public comments",
      "The proposed rules would have expanded slow zones off the East Coast as well as the size classes of boats and ships that must slow down.",
      "The fisheries service received about 90,000 public comments about them, according to documents set to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The filing says the service \"does not have sufficient time to finalize this regulation in this administration due to the scope and volume of public comments.\"",
      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have\u00a0long argued that\u00a0tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups\u00a0sued to try to speed up\u00a0the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\"This is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\" said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \"The way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "What to know about North Atlantic right whales",
      "Right whales are massive creatures that grow to be between 45 and 52 feet in length. Adults can weigh up to 70 tons, according to NOAA. They're identified by signature white calluses on the head.",
      "They were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists were concerned after seeing nearly a quarter of the world's population of the critically endangered North Atlantic\u00a0right whales\u00a0in an unusual and potentially dangerous spot for them, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "The New England Aquarium said at least 82 whales were observed in late July and August during research flights south of New York's Long Island \u2014 hundreds of miles away from\u00a0New England\u00a0and Canadian waters where they are typically seen in the summer.",
      "Aquarium scientist Katherine McKenna told the station that scientists didn't know for sure why the whales were in that area, but they seemed to be following food.",
      "\"They're kind of becoming more unpredictable with what they're doing in response to how the ocean conditions are changing,\" she said.",
      "Why these whales are important",
      "Whales are at the top of the ocean's food chain and they help capture carbon from the atmosphere, according to the international nonprofit World Wildlife Fund.",
      "The right whale is among six out of the 13 great whale species that are classified as endangered or vulnerable.",
      "They numbered more than 480 in 2010, but that fell by more than 25% over the following decade. It has\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0more recently, but the animal remains critically endangered. Vessel strikes are \"a leading cause of the species' decline,\" the National Marine Fisheries Service said in documents.",
      "Conservation groups that have pushed for the finalization of slower ship speed rules said they were motivated in part by documented collision deaths of right whales in recent years. In one much-publicized case last year, a calf stranded off the state of Georgia\u00a0had head injuries\u00a0consistent with a vessel strike, according to government investigators.",

    "summary": "Sen. Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the State Department as secretary of state, answered questions Wednesday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the State Department as secretary of state, called China \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted\" during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that largely focused on U.S. relations with the nation.",
      "\"The 21st Century will be defined by what happens between the United States and China,\" Rubio told his Senate colleagues, reiterating his long-held belief that the U.S. must push back on China's influence more forcefully.",
      "\"They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed,\" Rubio said. \"They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor now \u2014 in every realm. It is an extraordinary challenge.\"",
      "Rubio is likely to sail through the confirmation process to become the nation's top diplomat. He received a warm reception from members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is a member, who praised his extensive foreign policy experience.",
      "The confirmation hearing occurred as Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire and hostage release deal, U.S. officials said. Senate Foreign Relations chair Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican, announced at the hearing that he had been advised that a deal had been reached, with Rubio commenting that all those involved \"deserve credit for the deal.\"",
      "At times throughout the hearing, Rubio defended the decisions of his former rival, Trump, as he faced questions about the incoming president's potential conflicts of interest abroad and offered a strong defense of NATO despite Trump's past criticism of the defense alliance.",
      "\"Under President Trump, the top priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States,\" Rubio said.",
      "Like during and after the first World War, Rubio declared that the U.S. is once again \"called to create a free world out of the chaos.\"",
      "\"And this will not be easy,\" Rubio continued. \"And it will be impossible without a strong and a confident America that engages in the world, putting our core national interests, once again, above all else.\"",
      "Rubio, who has taken hardline positions on China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba, will inherit the position facing a number of global challenges, including Russia's war in Ukraine, persistent violence in the Middle East, China's aggression against Taiwan and its tense relationship with the U.S. Trump has also suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. He's floated annexing Canada as the 51st state and has threatened trade wars with U.S. allies.",
      "Rubio on China",
      "In the Senate, Rubio has been among the most outspoken on China, saying the nation is the \"threat that will define this century.\" Members of both parties have since adopted his positions on China.",
      "As well as warning about the national security risks, Rubio has also sought to hold China accountable for human rights abuses. In 2020, Beijing responded to Rubio's criticisms by banning him from the country. It's unclear what will become of that ban once he takes office and is tasked with carrying out Trump's foreign policy goals.",
      "Rubio told senators that much of China's growth has come at the expense of the U.S. and \"in less than 10 years, virtually everything that matters to us in life will depend on whether China will allow us to have it or not.\"",
      "\"Indeed, I've been strongly worded in my views of China. Let me just point out they've said mean things about me, too,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"My role now as a secretary of state is to lead the diplomatic wing of the country and that will involve engaging them.\"",
      "Rubio said it was in the interest of both countries to be able to communicate to avoid an armed conflict.",
      "\"Never in the history of mankind have two powers like the United States and China ever faced off in a global conflict, and the outcome would be catastrophic, and we should want to avoid it, and so should they,\" he said.",
      "Rubio on Ukraine and NATO",
      "The Florida Republican called for an end to the war in Ukraine, which has carried on for nearly three years since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.",
      "\"This war has to end,\" he said, adding that there should be a \"ceasefire.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Rubio about his seeming shift in what was once full-throated support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. Rubio voted against a foreign aid package last April that included assistance for Ukraine, despite his earlier support for the country. During the 2024 campaign, Trump criticized the Biden administration for sending billions to Ukraine in aid.",
      "\"I voted against that bill because I said I would not vote for a bill unless it addressed the crisis at our southern border as part of the overall arrangement,\" Rubio said. \"That was not done, and so I voted against it. That said, here's my view of the situation: Once this war became what we now know it is, and that is, a war of attrition, a stalemate, a protracted conflict, the dynamic on that situation has changed. It has.\"",
      "Rubio says Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, whose father fled Cuba, asked Rubio whether he believes Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "\"Without a question,\" Rubio responded.",
      "A day before Rubio's confirmation hearing, the Biden administration announced it is moving to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and ease economic restrictions as part of a deal for the release of political prisoners.",
      "Rubio, a supporter of strong sanctions on Havana's Communist regime, said it has been friendly towards Hamas and Hezbollah, hosts espionage stations for two countries hostile to the U.S., has strong ties to Iran and harbors fugitives from the American justice system.",
      "\"So there is zero doubt in my mind that they meet all the qualifications for being a state sponsor of terrorism,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether he would reverse the Biden administration's determination, Rubio said that was ultimately Trump's call but said \"nothing that was agreed to is irreversible or binding on the new administration.\"",
      "Panama Canal and Greenland",
      "The Panama Canal and Greenland, which have both received recent attention from Trump, were also topics of interest during the hearing.",
      "\"President Trump is not inventing this,\" Rubio said of questions about whether the canal remains neutral. \"This is something that's existed now for at least a decade.\"",
      "During a trip to Panama in 2017, Rubio said Chinese companies' control of port facilities on either end of the canal was \"the central issue\" discussed.",
      "\"This is a legitimate issue that needs to be confronted,\" he said.",
      "On Greenland, Rubio said the Denmark-owned territory has been \"strategically important\" to the U.S. for decades.",
      "Trump's potential foreign conflicts of interest",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut grilled Rubio on the potential foreign conflicts of interest that may arise between the United States' national interests and the Trump Organization's foreign business dealings.",
      "Murphy said Trump and his family have become \"more deeply dependent on revenue from governments in the Middle East,\" pointing to specific business deals.",
      "\"The Trump Organization is going to be signing new business deals in the Middle East with private companies that have connections to foreign governments at the very moment that you are going to be conducting sensitive diplomacy in these countries. That's just extraordinary,\" Murphy said. \"Never before in the history of this country has a president been, I mean literally, receiving cash from foreign governments and from foreign companies that are backed by foreign governments in the middle of their term. If you or I had done this as senators, we would be in violent violation of Senate ethics rules. That's not permitted on the Foreign Relations Committee.\"",
      "Murphy asked Rubio if he views profiting from Middle East deals as a potential conflict of interest, and whether he will bring that up with Trump. Rubio said he isn't a participant of or very familiar with Trump's overseas business deals, saying Trump's family members who are private citizens are running those companies.",
      "\"All I can tell you is that what I've said from the very beginning from the opening statement, and that is our foreign policy is going to be driven, as the president's made abundantly clear, by whether some action is in the good of the United States and our national security,\" Rubio said.",
      "Pressed further, Rubio specifically said Trump's family members have a right to conduct business deals abroad, and he doesn't believe Trump will allow personal business deals to adversely affect U.S. interests.",
      "\"The president doesn't manage that company,\" Rubio responded. \"His family members do, and they have a right to be in the business. I mean, that's the business that they're in. They're in the real estate business, they've been for a very long time, both domestically and abroad. They have properties in multiple countries. So, at the end of the day, his family is entitled to continue to operate their business.\"",
      "\"The fundamental question is not whether his family is involved in business. The fundamental question is whether that is in any way impacting the conduct of our foreign policy in a way that's counter to our national interest. And the president's made it abundantly clear that every decision he makes and every decision we are to make at the State Department should be driven by whether or not it serves the core national interests of the United States,\" he said.",
      "Who is Marco Rubio?",
      "Rubio, 53, was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in May 1956. His father was a banquet bartender and his mother worked as a hotel maid. According to his Senate website, Rubio \"was drawn to public service in large part because of his grandfather, who saw his homeland destroyed by communism.\"",
      "Rubio's long political career began when he served as city commissioner in West Miami after he earned degrees from the University of Florida and the University of Miami Law School. He was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, where he served until 2008, including two years as speaker.",
      "The Florida Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2010 and won his third six-year term in 2022. He has served on both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice chair on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Rubio was among a crowded field of GOP candidates running for president in 2016. He ended his campaign after losing the primary to Trump in his home state of Florida. The two verbally sparred during the campaign, with Rubio calling Trump \"a con artist\" who was hijacking the Republican Party and \"the most vulgar person\" to ever run for president. Trump sought to diminish his rival by nicknaming him \"Little Marco.\"",
      "Still, Rubio endorsed Trump for president after dropping out of the race and the two formed a pragmatic relationship in the years since. Trump eyed Rubio as a possible running mate in the 2024 race, but settled on Sen. JD Vance of Ohio instead.",
      "Does Marco Rubio have the votes to be confirmed?",
      "Rubio is all but certain to be confirmed, even with some Democratic support. A number of Senate Democrats have praised Trump's choice and have pledged to support his nomination on the floor, giving him many more than the 50 votes he needs for confirmation, barring something unforeseen.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was among the Democrats to compliment Rubio, saying he was \"extremely well-prepared.\"",
      "\"He's not talking out of a briefing book. He's not having to thumb through a binder to decide how to answer a particular question,\" Kaine said.",
      "Others spoke about their personal relationships with Rubio. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois recalled how Rubio helped push for Senate rules to be amended so that she could bring her newborn daughter with her on the floor to votes.",
      "\"What's the big deal? This place is already full of babies,\" Rubio remembered saying.",
      "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who met with Rubio on Monday, called the Florida Republican \"a good choice\" and said he \"has a thorough understanding of the United States' role on an international scale.\"",
      "\"I plan to vote yes on his nomination when it comes before the Senate,\" Durbin, a top Senate Democrat, said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Trump's pick to be CIA director promised in his confirmation hearing to hone in on setting strong intelligence collection priorities and \"demanding relentless execution.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that if he's confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday. \"We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.\"",
      "\"To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.\"",
      "He told the committee the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" and these challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day One to take them head-on.\"",
      "The two-hour hearing was one of about a\u00a0dozen hearings\u00a0scheduled for Trump's top administration picks this week ahead of his return to the White House next week. Though some of the president-elect's designated nominees have been subject to aggressive questioning and tense exchanges, the open portion of Ratcliffe's hearing remained notably civil. None of the Democrats on the committee expressed opposition to his formal nomination and Senate confirmation, though it's not yet clear how many Senate Democrats will vote to confirm him.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At that time, Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks Wednesday that \"for roughly a quarter of a century, I have devoted my professional life to U.S. national security.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton kicked off the hearing by listing the ways in which the CIA must \"get back to its roots,\" adding that it \"must overcome several challenges to do so.\" He argued the CIA has become too bureaucratic, and its analysis and priorities have become politicized, among other obstacles.",
      "\"Mr. Ratcliffe, you have a big job ahead of you,\" Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said. \"The nation needs a strong capable and aggressive CIA.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, agreed with Ratcliffe that the CIA faces an \"unprecedented number of challenges,\" and he mentioned the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, competition with China and the persistent threat of terrorism, which he said requires a \"great deal of leadership.\"",
      "Warner also outlined the importance of ensuring the intelligence community feels \"respected and valued,\" amid what he called \"underserved attacks\" by President-elect Donald Trump. He told Ratcliffe he has an opportunity at his confirmation hearing to \"reassure the men and women of the CIA that they not fear reprisal for being willing to speak truth to power.\"",
      "In Congress, Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee and was a staunch defender of Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference.",
      "In his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0in 2020 to be DNI, Ratcliffe vowed to deliver \"objective and timely\" intelligence to senior policymakers and to ensure that it was \"collected, analyzed and reported without bias, prejudice or political influence.\" He also disagreed with Trump about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but declined to take a stance on what Russia's desired outcome was.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Ratcliffe faced a slew of questions about politicization of the CIA, pledging not to bow to political pressure from the administration or elsewhere or take action for political purposes.",
      "Ratcliffe also responded to questions about how he would resist efforts to force out career civil servants due to their perceived political views or loyalty to Trump, noting that during his time as director of national intelligence \"that never took place\" and is something he \"would never do.\"",
      "He vowed to work on the development of tools \"to go on offense\" against cyber adversaries, warning of the threat to the nation's digital borders \"from half a world away.\"",
      "The committee is proceeding with its questioning in a closed-door session. Cotton said the committee plans to vote on advancing Ratcliffe's nomination as soon as possible, as soon as Monday afternoon, after the inauguration.",
      "Ratcliffe's nomination",
      "Ratcliffe is considered to be a more traditional choice than some of Trump's picks for other roles, since he has served in a Senate-confirmed position once already and was also a member of Congress.",
      "As intelligence director, he was criticized by Democrats for declassifying in the final days of the 2020 presidential election Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 race even though he acknowledged it might not be true. But like top intelligence officials of Republican and Democratic administrations, he has also been warning for years of the threat posed by China to U.S. interests.",
      "China was among the topics at Wednesday's hearing, and in December 2020, Ratcliffe wrote that China \"poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.\" Ratcliffe, who was the nation's spy chief at the time, said he had shifted resources in the intelligence budget to make China more of a priority.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:02:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications arising from surgery to treat prostate cancer.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon inspector general found in its review of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hospitalization last year that it \"increased unnecessarily\" the risks to national security, even if ultimately, there were no immediate consequences.",
      "\"Although we found no adverse consequences to Defense Department operations arising from how the hospitalizations we reviewed were handled, the risks to our national defense, including the command and control of the Defense Department's critical national security operations, were increased unnecessarily,\" Inspector General Robert Storch said in a statement.",
      "Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications related to surgery to treat prostate cancer. The Pentagon faced sharp criticism for waiting several days to inform the White House that Austin was in the hospital \u2014 and at one point, in the intensive care unit.",
      "The review did not identify any adverse impacts on operational command and control or Defense Department functions but says, \"we believe that there was a potential for adverse effects.\"",
      "A senior defense official told reporters shortly after the report was released, that the review \"found that at no time, was there a break in command and control\" and \"at every moment, either the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense was fully prepared to support the president as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "The report states that during the course of his hospitalization, Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to his deputy secretary of defense from Jan. 2 to 5, but neither of them notified Congress or the White House Situation Room in a \"timely manner\" as required.",
      "The report found that Austin did not consider transferring authorities while he was undergoing medical procedures on Jan. 6 and 8 that required moderate sedation. The inspector general found no evidence that Austin told the deputy secretary or his chief of staff he was undergoing the procedures. According to the review, Austin had texted his chief of staff that he did not want his medical condition to become \"a media circus.\"",
      "Austin told the inspector general investigators he told his doctors he would have to notify his superiors if he underwent general anesthesia. He signed forms acknowledging moderate sedation but said he needed to remain functional as \"that was the mandate \u2026 and I'm confident that that happened.\" He said that his doctors met his \"requirement to remain \u2026 functional.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the inspector general in its 20 recommendations said the Defense Department should further define what is \"medically incapacitated,\" and the phrase, \"unable to perform the functions and duties.\" Other recommendations include expanding the scope of who is required to report the hospitalization of secretaries of defense or senior Pentagon officials.",
      "The inspector general announced last year it would initiate a review to: \"examine the roles, processes, procedures, responsibilities, and actions related to the Secretary of Defense's hospitalization in December 2023 \u2013 January 2024, and assess whether the DoD's policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications and the effective transition of authorities as may be warranted due to health-based or other unavailability of senior leadership.\"",
      "The review found that Austin's intense privacy affected the course of events. It says that not only did Austin not tell his senior staff members of his medical condition or appointments, \"he specifically told one junior staff member 'if anyone had any questions they're more than welcome to ask [me] directly.'\"",
      "After he returned to work at the Pentagon following his hospitalization, Austin apologized for not telling President Biden or the public about when and why he had been hospitalized.",
      "\"We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right,\" Austin said. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\"",
      "The senior defense official said Austin \"apologized and he committed to improving transparency and processes moving forward, which the department has already done over the past year to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"",
      "CBS News obtained the audio of the 911 call that led to the hospitalization in which an aide asked the operator if the ambulance headed to Austin's residence could be discreet.",
      "\"Can I ask that, can the ambulance not show up with lights and sirens? We're trying to remain a little subtle,\" the caller is heard saying.",
      "A separate review by the Pentagon released last year concluded that there was no deliberate ill intent by Austin or his aides to keep the hospitalization secret but did acknowledge the policies for transferring the responsibilities of the secretary need to be improved.",
      "Austin told David Martin during a \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview that he is now cancer-free.",
      "\"I thank God for that,\" Austin said.",

    "summary": "In remarks to Congress, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Justice Department said that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end\" under her watch.",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0Wednesday that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end,\" if she is confirmed as attorney general.",
      "\"America must have one tier of justice for all,\" the former Florida attorney general said.\u00a0 Her opening statement was earlier obtained exclusively by CBS News.",
      "The declaration comes as Democrats are expected to pepper the close ally of the president-elect with questions over whether she might weaponize the Justice Department to target Trump's political enemies, including President Biden and former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The longtime prosecutor, who represented the president-elect during his first impeachment trial, says her \"overriding objective\" is to \"return the Department of Justice to its core mission,\" and vows to get the department \"back to basics \u2013 prosecuting violent crime and gang activity, stopping child predators and drug traffickers, protecting our nation from terrorists and other foreign threats, and addressing the overwhelming crisis at the Border.\"",
      "While seeking the job of the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, Bondi also plans to take aim at the Bureau of Prisons, promising to reduce recidivism and reform the federal agency long afflicted by understaffing, abuse, disrepair.",
      "\"We must fix the Bureau of Prisons and follow through on the promise of the First Step Act by building new halfway houses,\" Bondi said, referencing the president elect's hallmark criminal justice reform law. Signed by then-president Trump in 2018, it aims to reduce prison sentences and federal spending, but has been plagued by persistent implementation failures.",
      "\"The Bureau has suffered from years of mismanagement, lack of funding, and low morale. Federal corrections officers serve in challenging conditions on minimal pay and need more support. Our prison system can and will do better,\" Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Echoing the president-elect's promise of a \"new golden age,\" Bondi told lawmakers that Trump is \"unafraid to do things that have been deemed 'too difficult' and to reach across the aisle\" to address criminal justice reform.",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi formerly made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, and became an early advocate for Trump during his first bid for the White House in 2016.",
      "Harking on her early days as \"an intern at the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office,\" Bondi spotlighted her 18 years of experience as a prosecutor and two terms as Florida attorney general, which she claims was defined by a fight to eliminate drug dealers in a state \"overwhelmed by pill mills and opioid deaths.\" While serving as Florida's top cop, Bondi established a prescription drug monitoring program which requires opioid-prescribing clinics to register with the state and have a physician-owner.",
      "\"On the civil side, we worked to protect consumers,\" Bondi said, touting her efforts to tackle \"overreach by big tech companies.\"",
      "If confirmed as attorney general, Bondi would inherit a slew of legal fights against the world's largest technology companies, including ongoing litigation with TikTok and the department's ongoing defense of a law that would force its parent company to sell the platform altogether.",
      "In the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing, Bondi walked the halls of Capitol Hill, attending back-to-back meetings with senators. Unlike Trump's Gaetz, she is not expected to face significant hurdles to confirmation by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Considered one of the less controversial choices for Trump's\u00a0new cabinet, Democrats are still likely to probe Bondi on her interpretation of the role of attorney general and commitment to the independence of the Justice Department.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who met with Bondi last week, accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm, expressing concern that she might prioritize loyalty to Trump over the Constitution.",
      "\"The Department of Justice must also return to defending the foundational rights of all Americans, including free speech, free exercise of religion, and the right to bear arms,\" Bondi said, name-checking a campaign tagline of the president-elect. \"That is what the American people expect and deserve from the Department.\u00a0 If confirmed, I will do what it takes to make America safe again.\"",

      "Thompson, who was the chair of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, embraced the idea of a pardon in an interview with CBS News, saying Tuesday, \"I'm from a part of the country where speaking your opinion used to cost you your life.\"",
      "\"When I hear someone about to be sworn into the presidency of the United States say he wants to lock you up for doing your job, I believe it,\" he said of Trump, now the president-elect.",

      "President Biden has said he's continuing to weigh possible blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics and political enemies of Trump, a move that could shield them from prosecution by the incoming administration. The president has not said who might receive such a pardon.",
      "The president-elect has openly threatened members of the now-defunct House committee.",
      "In an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" last month, the incoming president accused members of the panel of destroying evidence and committing \"a major crime\" during their investigation. He said that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday about Trump's claim that the committee had destroyed evidence, Thompson noted that House Republicans have been conducting their own investigation of the select committee's work for two years. \"They've not come up with anything,\" Thompson said.",
      "But Thompson appears to be the only member of the select committee who would welcome a pardon ahead of Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Several of the panel's members have rejected the idea, arguing they don't need a pardon because they committed no wrongdoing in the course of their work.",
      "Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday, \"I stand by the work that we did. We didn't do anything wrong. I don't think a pardon is necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he didn't know what the right answer was when asked at a Politico Live event about the possibility Mr. Biden could pardon\u00a0members of the select committee. He argued that \"in any just world,\" they wouldn't need a pardon because they hadn't committed any crimes.",
      "He also noted that the Constitution's \"speech and debate\" clause protects members against criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits related to their legislative work.",
      "Some of the panel's other former members have discouraged pardons.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, told CBS News in December that he did not think the idea of a blanket pardon \"of any kind\" was a good idea, and would recommend against it.",
      "Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans who served on the panel, said on CNN this month that he did not want a pardon.",
      "\"I understand the theory behind it because Donald Trump has clearly said he's going to go after everybody,\" he said. \"...But the second you take a pardon, it looks like you're guilty of something. I'm guilty of nothing besides bringing the truth to the American people and in the process, embarrassing Donald Trump.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",

    "summary": "If the weather cooperates, the Starship launch will follow the maiden flight of Jeff Bezos' already weather-delayed New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",

      "Cicadas are set to return this year in the U.S., but their numbers are not expected to be as overwhelming as they were in the\u00a0spring of 2024, when multiple broods emerged simultaneously.",
      "Brood XIV, the second-largest group of periodical cicadas, known for their noisy mass emergence from the ground, is the only group of 17-year cicada that will emerge this spring, according to University of Connecticut researchers.",
      "Here's what we know about the cicadas in 2025:",
      "When will cicadas come back?",
      "For most of their lives, cicadas live underground, and then they emerge after a specific number of years once the soil reaches 64 degrees. Brood XIV emerges every 17 years.",
      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",
      "Where will Brood XIV cicadas emerge?",
      "Known as the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood,\" this group is historically found in areas of north Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.",
      "However, UConn researchers note that Brood XIV cicadas population are declining on Long Island and their distributions are shifting in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana. The researchers said they will map and study the cicadas' 2025 emergence to address gaps in knowledge about the patterns.",

      "SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship mega rocket on its seventh test flight Thursday, successfully \"catching\" the first stage booster back at its firing stand but losing its new-generation Starship upper stage spacecraft, which apparently broke up as it was reaching space. Falling debris from the destroyed Starship briefly delayed airline traffic out of Miami, Florida, federal officials said.",
      "Telemetry from the Starship froze eight minutes and 27 seconds after launch following unexpected engine shutdowns or failures. SpaceX later confirmed the ship's destruction in a posting on X, using a tongue-in-cheek description:",
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"We (lost) all communications with the ship,\" a SpaceX launch commentator said of the Starship. \"That is essentially telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage.\" A moment later, he confirmed: \"We did lose the upper stage.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration also reported that airline traffic at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports was delayed up to an hour due to what it described as a \"rocket launch anomaly.\"",
      "The FAA in a statement said it \"briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\" It said normal operations had resumed.",
      "\"The FAA is aware an anomaly occurred during the SpaceX Starship Flight 7 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on Jan. 16,\" the agency said in a follow-up statement, adding that it is \"assessing the operation.\"",
      "Video posted to social media and verified by CBS News showed debris from the Starship falling in the area of Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.",
      "pic.twitter.com/cuVfkNvDUK",
      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",
      "But Thursday's test flight featured multiple experiments to test a variety of heat shield improvements, including metallic tiles and one with active cooling, along with dummy Starship catch fittings, to learn more about how they will respond to re-entry heating.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "summary": "Despite losing its booster during a landing attempt, the upper stage reached orbit as planned.",
    "story": [
      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",
      "\"After Blue Ghost lands on the moon, we'll be collecting critical payload science data throughout the entire mission,\" he said. \"We'll then wrap up the mission by capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset in high definition video before operating several hours into the lunar night.\"",
      "Toward the end of the mission, the company hopes to capture a phenomenon first seen by NASA's Surveyor moon landers and at least two Apollo crews, a so-called \"horizon glow\" caused by sunlight interacting with small dust particles kicked up by solar radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.",
      "\"Knowing that Firefly's Blue Ghost mission is a culmination of what the last Apollo astronaut to walk on the moon observed is a fitting tribute to their legacy,\" Kim said.",

      "Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin readied the company's powerful New Glenn rocket for its delayed but long-awaited maiden flight early Monday, kicking off a high-stakes bid to compete head-to-head with Elon Musk's SpaceX and its industry dominating Falcon family of rockets.",
      "While more than one successful test flight will be needed to demonstrate the reliability needed for launches of costly NASA probes, high-priority national security payloads and other commercial spacecraft, the New Glenn, nearly 10 years after Bezos announced the project, is expected to be a viable alternative.",
      "Mounted atop pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the 321-foot-tall rocket is scheduled for blast off at 1 a.m. EST Monday, the opening of a three-hour window. Blue Origin had hoped to launch the rocket Friday, then Sunday, but both opportunities were ruled out due to rough seas in the booster landing zone.",
      "Mission managers expect better weather Monday.",
      "Like SpaceX's Falcon rockets, the first stage of the New Glenn, powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines generating a combined 3.8 million pounds of thrust, was designed to be reusable.",
      "After boosting the rocket's upper stage out of the lower atmosphere three minutes and 10 seconds after launch, the 188-foot-tall first stage will separate and attempt to land on a 380-foot-long custom-built ship named after Bezos' mother, Jacklyn, that will be stationed downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "From launch to touchdown: nine minutes and 28 seconds. While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin is making the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. Appropriately enough, the company named the booster \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "While the 23-foot-wide first stage is powered by liquified natural gas, the 88-foot-tall upper stage is equipped with two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines that generate a combined 320,000 pounds of thrust. They can be restarted in space up to three times over 16 hours, enabling the stage to place payloads in especially demanding orbits.",
      "The New Glenn's carbon-composite nose fairing, which encapsulates payloads during the climb to space, provides 16,184 cubic feet of volume, large enough to house an entire New Shepard rocket, the booster Blue Origin uses to launch space tourists\u00a0on sub-orbital flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "For its maiden flight, the New Glenn will carry a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as Blue Ring, a sort of space tug that can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing onboard computer support and even servicing.",
      "The flight plan calls for the upper stage and the attached Blue Ring test vehicle to reach an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles. The mission is expected to last five hours and 50 minutes from start to finish.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet, with 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other payloads weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck. There are no such payloads on the initial \"pathfinder\" flight, but the spacecraft will be thoroughly checked out in orbit.",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and now dominates the global commercial launch market, firing off 134 Falcon-family rockets last year and five so far in 2025. SpaceX has successfully recovered first stage boosters 395 times.",
      "SpaceX also is building a gargantuan new rocket -- the Super Heavy-Starship -- with a seventh test flight on tap as early as Monday from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, launch site. A variant of the rocket's Starship upper stage is being built for NASA to carry astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface as part of the Artemis program.",

      "Amazon plans its own fleet of more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper. The company says it has booked up to 95 launches with Blue Origin, the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"Once deployed, the Kuiper System will serve individual households, as well as schools, hospitals, businesses, disaster relief efforts, government agencies and other organizations operating in places without reliable broadband,\" Amazon says on its website.",
      "Whether Amazon can succeed against SpaceX in the space-based internet services market remains to be seen. But Blue Origin's New Glenn will provide an alternative to SpaceX when it comes to launch services.",
      "The rocket was designed from the ground up to be \"human rated,\" enabling astronaut flights at some point in the future. If successful, the rocket will eventually be used to launch NASA space probes, classified military payloads, commercial satellites, lunar cargo ships and even piloted moon landers for NASA.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

    "title": "Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "title": "Biden administration proposes new restrictions on AI chip exports",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship mega rocket on its seventh test flight Thursday, successfully \"catching\" the first stage booster back at its firing stand but losing its new-generation Starship upper stage spacecraft, which apparently broke up as it was reaching space. Falling debris from the destroyed Starship briefly delayed airline traffic out of Miami, Florida, federal officials said.",
      "Telemetry from the Starship froze eight minutes and 27 seconds after launch following unexpected engine shutdowns or failures. SpaceX later confirmed the ship's destruction in a posting on X, using a tongue-in-cheek description:",
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"We (lost) all communications with the ship,\" a SpaceX launch commentator said of the Starship. \"That is essentially telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage.\" A moment later, he confirmed: \"We did lose the upper stage.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration also reported that airline traffic at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports was delayed up to an hour due to what it described as a \"rocket launch anomaly.\"",
      "The FAA in a statement said it \"briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\" It said normal operations had resumed.",
      "\"The FAA is aware an anomaly occurred during the SpaceX Starship Flight 7 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on Jan. 16,\" the agency said in a follow-up statement, adding that it is \"assessing the operation.\"",
      "Video posted to social media and verified by CBS News showed debris from the Starship falling in the area of Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.",
      "pic.twitter.com/cuVfkNvDUK",
      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",
      "But Thursday's test flight featured multiple experiments to test a variety of heat shield improvements, including metallic tiles and one with active cooling, along with dummy Starship catch fittings, to learn more about how they will respond to re-entry heating.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in the 2027 timeframe.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched in an Orion capsule atop NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in orbit around the moon for the descent to the surface.",

In a home built using the passive design concept, there are very few places for embers to get caught, according to Johny Rezvani, a Passive Home material supplier.",

During the winter months and when the jet stream allows, this cold air can drop farther down into lower latitudes like in the United States. This is forecast to happen as soon as this weekend.",
      "Beginning Saturday, the polar vortex will begin to dip down into the northern tier of the U.S., dropping temperatures into the single digits. Wind chills will already be dropping into the negative teens for that region. Forecast temperatures will be 20-25 degrees below average for this time of year.",
      "On Sunday, the chills really start to kick in, with temperatures dropping into the teens across the Central Plains. Wind chills will be down to the negative 20s in the Northern Plains and single digits for the Central Plains, making for dangerously cold conditions for those attending NFL playoff games. Forecast temperatures will be 25-30 degrees below average for this time of year.",
      "On Monday, the polar vortex will reach the Deep South, with temperatures down to the freezing point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit in Atlanta. Wind chills will be in the 20s. Across the Rockies, Plains and\u00a0Midwest, some areas won't make it out of the single digits.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:09:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Watch Duty app's fire fact-checkers brought reliable information to Los Angeles residents during a week of chaos.",
    "story": [
      "Since the Palisades Fire broke out on the morning of Jan. 7, several more wildfires have ravaged the Los Angeles area. At least 27 people have died and more than 12,000 structures have been destroyed.",
      "In the middle of all of this, a false evacuation alert sent to all of L.A. County's approximately 10 million residents on Jan. 9 added to the chaos, as many Angelenos were left unsure what to believe.",
      "\"While the city alerts are definitely alarming, we just aren't able to take any city push alerts at face value after [a] couple rounds of mistakes,\" Sharvari Akre-Bhide, a clinical researcher living in L.A., told CBS News.",
      "Instead, L.A. residents flocked to Watch Duty, an app which shows real-time updates and alerts for wildfires in 21 states.",
      "In the first days of the fires, Watch Duty shot to the No. 1 spot in Apple's app store seemingly overnight. It provides users easy-to-read maps showing burn areas, evacuation zones, fire cameras and more. It's all sourced from publicly available data and verified by a team of fire fact-checkers.",
      "\"Sending errant emergency alerts is a quick way to erode trust,\" John Mills, co-founder and CEO of the app told CBS News.",
      "Watch Duty has been a lifeline for many people in wildfire-prone communities since it was created in 2021.",
      "\"We did heed the first city alert enough to pack an emergency bag, but other than that have been monitoring Watch Duty before taking any action,\" Akre-Bhide said. \"...We've been basically cross checking every city push alert that goes out immediately with Watch Duty and then reevaluating.\"",
      "She's not the only one. Longtime California resident Keri Gailloux told CBS News she checks Watch Duty the same way she would her favorite weather app.",
      "\"It's about the facts,\" Gailloux said. \"It's about what's real and in real time, as much as you can get it. And while I love listening to people's opinions about things, that's where misinformation really can happen.\"",
      "The process to track and verify its information is deceptively simple, Watch Duty says. Information comes in, gets confirmed and goes out to users.",
      "\"The difference with Watch Duty is that the people who are reporting on it are people who have been in the field, people who understand the importance of, 'You've got a five minute evacuation window,'\" Gailloux said.",
      "Watch Duty has more than 150 volunteers made up of active and retired first responders, firefighters and dispatchers who monitor radios, scan the internet, and reach out to officials. If something comes in through one of those channels, the team coordinates and confirms the various pieces of new information. Once it's confirmed, an incident leader will send the update to the app, which in turn alerts users in the area.",
      "\"We have historical recordings of everything that we do here.\" Mills explained. \"So it's kind of hard to debate, because that's what was said at that time. And so we try to remove opinion and sensationalism from this.\"",
      "Mills says that straightforward process of fact and science \"used to be the world that we lived in, and we want to bring that back.\"",
      "\"We didn't start this because of misinformation,\" Mills said. \"We started it from looking at good information.\"",
      "Mills points to what he believes is an outdated national alert system, ill-equipped to handle the ferocity of future natural disasters as one of the reasons for the confusion seen in California.",
      "\"They have these arcane checks and balances from the FEMA ICS (Incident Command System) structure that was invented in the seventies.\" Mills said. \"Disasters are moving faster, and they haven't updated.\"",
      "Mills remarks come as the L.A. Fire Department is facing scrutiny over its response to the Palisades Fire.",
      "\"I'm not here blaming L.A. Emergency Operations Center or any of these people. This is a hard job to do,\" Mills said.",
      "Gailloux seems to agree.",
      "\"If you're waiting for the news to tell you what to do, or you're waiting for the fire trucks to show up, you could be dead.\" Gailloux said. \"[Watch Duty] understands the urgency.\"",
      "Mills sees a need for Watch Duty's service beyond fires, with climate change putting more people in the path of potential disasters.",
      "\"We've seen the same nonsense happen during floods, the recent tsunami warning in California that went awry, and just the misinformation that spreads around panic.\"",
      "According to Mills, Watch Duty is unique from its Silicon Valley counterparts in that it is a nonprofit with no plans to change.",
      "\"Watch Duty is a nonprofit because, I mean the very easy answer is, it's the right thing to do,\" Mills said.",
      "With 2.8 million users, premium membership options and full-time employees, Watch Duty has a significant cash flow. According to the company's 2024 annual report, it brought in $5.6 million in funding through a combination of grants, donations, and paying members. But Mills has no plans to put the app behind a paywall.",
      "\"This is a governmental service and a municipal operation that needs to exist free and devoid of ads, spam, sign-up logins, marketing to 3rd parties, [and] selling you fire hoses when you're trying to run for your life.\" Mills said. \"It's just ridiculous, and so we will take no part in that.\"",
      "So how should California government officials respond? Says Mills, \"If I were them, I would pick up the phone and call me.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas is allowing three other states to pursue a challenge seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in Texas ruled Thursday that three other states can move ahead with their effort to roll back federal rules and make it harder for people across the U.S. to access the abortion drug mifepristone.",
      "The states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri made the request in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. The only judge based there is Matthew Kacsmaryk, a nominee of former President Donald Trump who previously ruled in favor of a challenge to the pill's approval.",
      "The states want the federal Food and Drug Administration to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone and require that it be used only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the current limit of 10 weeks. They also want to require three in-person doctor office visits instead of none to get the drug.",
      "That's because, the states argue, efforts to provide access to the pills \"undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state law enforcement,\" according to court documents.",
      "Meanwhile, Kacsmaryk said they shouldn't be automatically discounted from suing in Texas just because they're outside the state.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that the case should have been settled when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to mifepristone last year, where the justices issued a narrow ruling finding that abortion opponents who first filed the case lacked the legal right to sue.",
      "Kacsmaryk's decision \"has left the door open for extremist politicians to continue attacking medication abortion in his courtroom,\" the ACLU said.",
      "The ruling comes days before Trump begins his second term as president, so his administration will likely be representing the FDA in the case. Trump has repeatedly said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government, though he's also stressed on the campaign trail that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion in 2022.",
      "In the years since, abortion opponents have increasingly targeted abortion pills, largely due to most U.S. abortions being carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures. So far, at least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have seen Republicans introduce bills aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Previously, Kacsmaryk sided with a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations that wanted the FDA to be forced to rescind entirely its approval of mifepristone in 2000.",
      "Yet the states are pursuing a narrower challenge. Rather than target the approval entirely, they sought to undo a series of FDA updates that have eased access.",
      "But while the states' leaders are pushing to severely limit access to the drugs, voters in Missouri sent a different message in November when they approved a ballot measure to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. In Idaho, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. In Kansas, abortion is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy.",
      "Across the U.S., 13 states under Republican legislative control bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four more ban it after the first six weeks \u2014 before women often know they're pregnant.",
      "Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws seeking to shield from investigations and prosecutions the doctors who prescribe the pills via telehealth appointments and mail them to patients in states with bans. Those prescriptions are a major reason a study found that residents of states with bans are getting abortions in about the same numbers as they were before the bans were in place.",
      "Mifepristone is usually used in combination with a second drug for medication abortion, which has accounted for more than three-fifths of all abortions in the U.S. since the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",

      "\"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,\" a statement posted to Lynch's social media reads. \"We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "Lynch, who would have turned 79 on Monday, revealed in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung disease, after years of smoking.",
      "Lynch, who was born in Montana in 1946, was a writer, director and painter who studied at the American Film Institute. He first broke into the movie scene in 1977 when he turned his thesis project into his first feature film \"Eraserhead,\" a black-and-white surrealist indie film that quickly gained notoriety as a midnight movie.",
      "\"Eraserhead\" attracted the attention of producer Mel Brooks, who brought Lynch aboard to direct \"The Elephant Man,\" an adaptation of the life and times of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick, telling the younger director, \"You're a crazy man. You're hired.\"",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" earned Lynch his first of three Academy Award nominations for best director, followed by \"Blue Velvet\" in 1986 and \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, the latter also earning Lynch a best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, where he previously earned the festival's top prize \u2014 the Palme d'Or \u2014 for 1990's \"Wild at Heart.\"",
      "Lynch also directed the ill-fated 1984 movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune.\"",
      "But for many, Lynch's most famous contribution to pop culture was his collaboration with Mark Frost on ABC's primetime drama \"Twin Peaks,\"\u00a0 which hooked viewers immediately with its sui generis combination of mystery and quirk, spurring legions to tune in weekly to find out who murdered Laura Palmer, who was played by Sheryl Lee.",
      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",
      "In 2019, Lynch received an honorary Academy Award at the Motion Picture Academy's Governors Awards, and in 2012, he received honorary degrees from the American Film Institute.",

      "The incoming Trump administration is planning to install Texas' border czar as head of U.S. Border Patrol, replacing the career official who currently leads the agency in charge of stopping the illicit movement of migrants and drugs.",
      "Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, two sources familiar with the move told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Banks would replace current Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, a 28-year veteran career official at the agency. Owens is set to retire from government service in April, two U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "In an internal message sent to agents Thursday and obtained by CBS News, Owens said the opportunity to serve as Border Patrol chief was \"the highest honor I have ever received.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, I will leave with a profound sense of optimism about its future and that of our country,\" Owens wrote. \"I will take comfort knowing that you are on our frontline, standing between the innocent and the evil.\"",
      "Banks' appointment would be a departure from the general practice of Border Patrol having leaders that are career government officials, not political appointees.",
      "A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, Banks has been a key player in Texas' aggressive effort to counter what the state has argued is the Biden administration's failure to secure the southern border amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "Since March 2021, Texas has bussed tens of thousands of migrants to major Democratic-led U.S. cities, deployed the National Guard to fortify the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and assigned troopers to arrest migrants on criminal trespassing charges.",
      "It also tried to enact its own immigration law to arrest and jail migrants suspected of entering the country illegally, though that measure is currently held up in court.",
      "As Border Patrol chief, Banks would oversee the agents in green uniforms responsible for apprehending migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally between official entry points, or those who reach Florida and other coastal sectors by sea. Over the past years, discontent among rank-and-file agents has grown over disagreements with the Biden administration's immigration policies.",
      "One U.S. official said Banks is expected to join the second Trump administration in some capacity soon after Trump is inaugurated, alongside Rodney Scott, who the president-elect has tapped to be his CBP commissioner.",
      "Scott was a Border Patrol chief himself, appointed under the first Trump administration, until he was ousted by the Biden administration in the spring of 2021. As CBP commissioner, Scott would oversee Border Patrol, but also customs and immigration officials at airports, sea ports and land crossings. That position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Beyond Banks and Scott, the incoming Trump administration also plans to install Tom Homan, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, as its border czar, a new White House position. Homan is expected to play a key role in carrying out what Trump has promised will be the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "During the first three years of the Biden administration, CBP reported record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, and officials struggled at times to contain mass illegal crossings. But unlawful border crossings have since plunged to a four-year low due to asylum limits President Biden enacted in June, and Mexico's efforts to stop migrants from trekking north.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Thursday that it may announce opinions on Friday morning, a last-minute addition to the schedule that comes just two days before a law that would ban TikTok is set to go into effect.",
      "\"The Court may announce opinions on the homepage beginning at 10 a.m.,\" a notice on the\u00a0court's website said, without specifying what case or cases might be decided. \"The Court will not take the Bench.\"",
      "The law would cut TikTok off from U.S. app stores and hosting services if it does not cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, before the Jan. 19 deadline.",
      "The Supreme Court seemed likely to upload the law when it heard arguments over TikTok's legal challenge last week, with the justices seeming sympathetic to the government's claims that China could use TikTok to collect a vast amount of data on its American users and spy on them.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the potential Supreme Court decision is \"enormously consequential\" for the platform's 170 million users in the U.S. and their free speech rights.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Sunday, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said last week. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "In April, Congress swiftly passed the bipartisan legislation, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as part of a foreign aid package, and it was signed into law by President Biden. It gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, with the possibility of a 90-day extension if a sale were in progress by the January deadline.

    "summary": "Researchers say the conspiracies around the L.A. wildfires follow familiar patterns.",
    "story": [
      "While investigators work to find out what caused multiple wildfires in the Los Angeles area, some conspiracies about the fires' origins have spread on social media platforms.",
      "Posts about baseless theories \u2014 ranging from celebrity involvement to secret government weapons \u2014 have racked up millions of views.",
      "Despite fact-checking efforts, researchers say conspiracies of this kind regularly emerge after large wildfires.",
      "\"I think that the more emotionally overwhelming it is, the more likely we are to just see high volumes of conspiracy theories to cope and make people feel like they have control,\" said misinformation researcher Abbie Richards.",
      "Directed energy weapons conspiracy resurfaces",
      "Misleading videos have fueled false claims that directed energy weapons, often referred to as DEWs, ignited the flames. The conspiracy theory suggests that governments or secret organizations use lasers or microwave systems to ignite fires.",
      "Experts have repeatedly debunked these claims, attributing irregular burn patterns to natural factors like wind, terrain and vegetation.",
      "While the U.S. has developed and tested DEWs for military applications \u2014 such as disabling enemy drones or missiles \u2014 there is no credible evidence of DEWs being employed in civilian settings, including for igniting wildfires.",
      "The DEW theory also surfaced during the California wildfires of 2018, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claiming in a now-deleted social media post the fires could be caused by lasers from space. And online users spread the conspiracy during other disasters including the Canadian and Maui fires in 2023 and the Texas Smokehouse Creek wildfire in 2024.",
      "\"Most people will see this sort of stuff and completely reject it because it doesn't match with how they already view the world. But there are people who view the world through a conspiratorial lens,\" said Joseph Uscinski, co-author of \"American Conspiracy Theories.\"",
      "Claims that weather is manmade",
      "Claims have circulated that the government could have geoengineered rain to stop the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Theories that the government has some control over the weather have surfaced after several natural disasters, including hurricanes Helene and Milton. And meteorologists and agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have debunked these claims.",
      "People blame the government or company executives because it's easier than facing structural problems, like drought conditions,\" Geoff Dancy, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, told CBS News.",
      "\"That is more attractive to people that are desperate for order amid catastrophe,\" Dancy said.",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a December assessment on cloud seeding at least nine states are using the technology, which is \"primarily funded at the state level or below\" and there is little federal intervention.",
      "For cloud seeding to be effective, the atmosphere around greater Los Angeles would have required more moisture in the clouds for water vapor to be condensed, Katja Friedrich, a cloud physics expert and professor at Colorado University at Boulder, told PolitiFact.",
      "\"The L.A. area is currently so dry that there is not enough water that you could condense,\" Friedrich said.",
      "Land grab conspiracy",
      "Another unfounded claim shared on social media suggests the Southern California wildfires were started to clear land so officials could make way for what are called \"smart cities,\" aligned with United Nations' goals.",
      "The U.N.'s agenda to cut global emissions includes making cities more sustainable. And the Los Angeles Area's SmartLA 2028 initiative suggests renovating the city's transportation systems, among other technological changes, to make the city greener \u2014 but the plan does not involve mass demolition or rebuilding.",
      "This conspiracy also gained traction after the wildfires in Maui, when a video of Hawaii's governor was clipped, taken out of context and shared to bolster the false claim the state was aiming to create a \"smart city\" on scorched land. And similar theories were debunked after wildfires in Canada and Spain's Canary Islands.",
      "Celebrity crime cover-up conspiracy",
      "Some posts that reached millions of people on TikTok falsely claim the wildfires were sparked to destroy evidence in the sex trafficking case against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 falsely claiming his mansion was consumed in flames.",
      "In reality, Combs' mansion remains intact and outside the evacuation zone as of Jan. 16.",
      "His home was raided in March by federal agents who seized evidence on the property, and People reported the home was listed for sale in September.",
      "False claims about celebrity homes also spread after the Maui wildfire, with some users sharing baseless claims that Oprah Winfrey helped start those fires.",
      "Addressing the spread of conspiracies",
      "By coincidence, on the day the wildfires started, Facebook announced it was ending its third party fact checking program and loosening its automated systems that police policy violations, instead relying more on users to report issues before they take action. The platform is adopting a crowdsourced \"community notes\" system, similar to Elon Musk's X.",
      "Dancy said conspiracy theorists are \"benefitting from the information revolution\" we live in. \"It's an attention economy, and conspiracy theories get attention,\" Dancy said.",
      "He advocates for regulating social media algorithms that prioritize sensational content.",

    "summary": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit comes after \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively accused him of sexual harassment.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",
      "The two actors are also both represented by agency WME, which dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed a legal complaint that was a precursor to her lawsuit and the Times published its story on the fight surrounding the film.",
      "The surprise hit film has made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",

      "The world's largest retailer in November joined a growing list of corporations ditching their DEI programs after coming under attack by conservative activists. The sweeping changes included a decision by Walmart not to renew a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd. Walmart also said it would no long consider race or gender in its treatment of suppliers.",

Meta last week said it would pull the plug on its DEI programs, joining other corporate giants to make the move, including\u00a0Ford\u00a0and\u00a0McDonald's. The retrenchment accelerated in 2023 after the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions, a decision that emboldened anti-DEI activists.",

      "Still, mamor companies including \u00a0Apple, Costco and\u00a0Target\u00a0continue to support their DEI policies.

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:44:35 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump will likely owe the state of New York about half a billion dollars when he's sworn in as president.",
    "story": [
      "Quietly, just before the calendar turned for the new year, an already whopping debt tentatively owed by President-elect Donald Trump and co-defendants in his New York civil fraud case hit an eye-popping, interest-accumulating milestone: half a billion dollars.",
      "Trump, two of his sons and a former executive at his company were ordered in February 2024 to pay $364 million in \"ill-gotten gains\" and millions more in interest dating back years. The figure, which was then $464 million, continued to accrue more than $114,000 in interest per day. The judgment is on appeal.",
      "The total crossed $500 million on Dec. 29, and stands at more than $502 million on Thursday, a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James confirmed.",
      "Trump, who would personally owe about $490 million of that sum, has banked on a reprieve from New York's mid-level Appellate Division, First Department court. During arguments in September, at least two of five justices on the appeals panel seemed skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\"",
      "But as the defendants await the panel's decision, which is expected early this year, interest has continued to pile up. The court typically releases opinions on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and the Trump case was not among the batch released today.",
      "That means Trump will likely be sworn in as president on Monday with a debt to the state of New York larger than the combined proposed 2025 budgets for New York's sixth and seventh largest cities, Albany and New Rochelle.",
      "Trump has raged against the debt and the case, in which a judge concluded he and his company manipulated spreadsheets provided to accountants to juice valuations provided to banks and insurers. The result, James' office argued and Judge Arthur Engoron concluded, was that Trump and his company received more favorable terms on loans and insurance deals that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.",
      "The growing total they may owe the state, known as disgorgement, is equal to the amount Engoron concluded they profited through the scheme, plus interest.",
      "During a later 2023 bench trial in the case, Trump was called to the stand, where he cast blame on his employees and outside accountants, but said his books were compiled accurately. He claimed that, far from overvaluing his assets and net worth, his company \"underestimated\" them.",
      "On top of the half billion owed in the New York civil case, Trump also owes more than $88 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll, after jurors in 2023 and 2024 found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation.",
      "He has denied all allegations in the New York and Carroll cases, and is pursuing appeals in all three.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:28:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Ashley Moody, the state's attorney general, will replace Marco Rubio in the Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody will replace Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, in the Senate.",
      "\"Today I am proud to announce that I am selecting our attorney general, Ashley Moody, to serve as our next U.S. senator,\" DeSantis said at a news conference in Orlando, saying she's \"honorably served our people\" during her time as the state's top law enforcement officer.",
      "\"These are always significant appointments, but I think right now appointments like these are more significant than ever,\" DeSantis said. \"This is a time for action and a time for Washington, D.C., to deliver results for the American people.\"",
      "DeSantis called Trump's victory in the 2024 election \"remarkable,\" saying he earned a \"mandate for change.\"",
      "\"No more business as usual in Washington, D.C.,\" DeSantis added.",
      "The Florida governor emphasized border security as part of that mandate, saying Florida would be working with the Trump administration to make sure immigration laws are enforced.",
      "DeSantis outlined his criteria for the Senate appointment Thursday, saying he wanted someone who would deliver on Trump's agenda, commit to cutting spending, understand that federal bureaucracy has \"run amok\" and understand \"the fight against illegal immigration.\"",
      "Moody, 49, has served as Florida's attorney general since 2019. DeSantis touted Moody's \"impressive resume\" as a commercial litigator and federal prosecutor, noting that she became Florida's youngest circuit court judge in 2007. The Florida governor said Moody has been someone who \"has acted time and time again to support the values that we all share,\" from addressing the opioid and fentanyl crisis to illegal immigration and human trafficking.",
      "DeSantis also pointed to Moody's track record of supporting the president-elect, noting that she signed on to lawsuits to \"take on the weaponization of law enforcement that targeted then-candidate Donald Trump,\" took on special counsel Jack Smith and fought back against New York Attorney General Letitia James. He also noted that Moody led the state investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Moody, speaking after DeSantis on Thursday, said she would \"bring the same persistence and passion and tenacity as a United States senator that I have brought as Florida's attorney general.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to show up and fight for this nation and fight for President Trump to deliver the America first agenda on day one,\" Moody said, while pledging to rein in \"out of control federal agencies\" and bring down spending.",
      "Senate vacancies in Florida are filled by an appointment by the governor, who selects a replacement to serve until the next statewide election. DeSantis' appointment means Moody will be expected to hold the seat until a special election can be held in 2026. The winner of the 2026 election would serve the remainder of Rubio's term, meaning that person would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "The announcement comes after months of speculation about who could fill the seat. A number of possibilities have emerged for DeSantis to appoint, including Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who until recently was the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Last month, she said she was removing herself from consideration.",
      "DeSantis' chief of staff James Uthmeier and Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez had also been floated, as had former Florida House Speaker Jose Olivia. DeSantis said Thursday that he also thinks highly of Reps. Kat Cammack and Cory Mills, whom he said had also been in the mix, but he didn't want to jeopardize the narrow House Republican majority. He noted that Uthmeier would become Florida's new attorney general.",
      "Trump tapped Rubio, who has represented Florida in the Senate since 2011, for the Cabinet post in November. The 53-year-old China hawk has extensive foreign policy experience and is expected to have among the smoothest paths to confirmation in the Senate. He appeared at his confirmation hearing this week, and is expected to resign from the Senate when Trump is sworn in next week.",

      "Companies say they are working to update their products to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's decision Wednesday to ban the artificial food dye Red 3, after the agency said it was revoking the additive's authorization over concerns it was causing cancer in rats.",
      "While the agency says that studies show the way Red 3 causes cancer in rats does not occur in humans, the law still requires additives that cause cancer in animals to be pulled from the market even if they are not proven to pose a risk to humans as well.",
      "The FDA says that food companies will have until Jan. 15, 2027 to stop using the dye. Drugmakers will have an extra year, until January 2028, to comply with the change.",
      "Which food brands have Red 3 in their products?",
      "Red 3, also known as erythrosine, Acid Red 51 or FD&C Red No. 3, is often used in candy. But other companies also use Red 3 to color a wide variety of products, from drinks to vegetarian meats, and will be forced to rework their recipes.",

      "Some Conagra Brands products, including its Marie Callender's birthday cake pie and Duncan Hines confetti cake mix, list Red 3 as an ingredient. A Conagra spokesperson said they are \"minimally impacted\" by the FDA's ruling, and are \"taking steps to remove it from a limited number\" of their products in time for the rule's deadline.",
      "Seasoning and condiments giant McCormick said it had also \"already begun the process of removing Red 3 prior to the FDA ruling\" on the dye. The spokesperson said McCormick has only \"very limited use of Red 3 in our branded retail products.\" Some of their products still listing Red 3 include vegan imitation bacon chips and Cake Mate red icing.",

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died, the baseball commissioner's office confirmed to CBS News. He was 90.",
      "The Brewers announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker's family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson's late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker was a beloved member of the baseball community and a pillar of the sport in Wisconsin.",
      "When the Brewers clinched the NL Central title in 2024, manager Pat Murphy threw an arm around Uecker in the locker room, pulling him in tight as players white-knuckled their corks, ready to shower \"Mr. Baseball\" in Champagne.",
      "\"There is no one \u2014   there is no one \u2014   who epitomizes a champion the way this man does right here,\" Murphy proclaimed as the players chanted \"UUUUUECK.\"",
      "\"What an example for us to be with every single day \u2014   Bob Uecker.\"",
      "Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He'd last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\"Career highlights? I had two,\" he often joked. \"I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\"",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Netanyahu said Thursday that a \"last-minute crisis\" with Hamas was delaying Israel's final approval of the long-sought truce.

      "Ofer was among the dozens of people kidnapped by the gunmen who stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz. Over the age of 50, he should be among the hostages released by Hamas in the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire agreement.",
      "But asked if she felt a huge relief on Wednesday night, Kalderon made it clear that emotion would have to wait.",

The crimes took place a decade ago when Starmer was the country's top prosecutor.",

Similar exploitation was discovered in other towns, leading to a national inquiry.",
      "The prosecution service, which was led by Starmer between 2008 and 2013, was criticized in the report for not pursuing charges in Rochdale because it viewed a victim as \"unreliable\" following an investigation between 2008 and 2009. That decision was later overturned by a Starmer appointee.",

    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "The Appeal Court prosecutors' office in Metz, in northeastern France, said Ian Cleary was handed over to U.S. authorities at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.",
      "Cleary, 31, of Saratoga, California, was detained in April in Metz after a three-year search. He has been held in custody pending extradition proceedings since his arrest. The Appeal Court in Metz ruled in July that he could be extradited.",
      "Cleary had been the subject of an international search since authorities in Pennsylvania issued a 2021 felony warrant in the case weeks after an Associated Press story detailed the reluctance of local prosecutors to pursue campus sex crimes.",
      "The arrest warrant accuses Cleary of stalking an 18-year-old Gettysburg College student at a party in 2013, sneaking into her dorm and sexually assaulting her while she texted friends for help. He was a 20-year-old Gettysburg student at the time, but didn't return to campus.",
      "The accuser, Shannon Keeler, had a rape exam done the same day. She gathered witnesses and evidence and spent years urging officials to file charges. She went to authorities again in 2021 after discovering the Facebook messages that seemed to come from Cleary's account.",
      "\"So I raped you,\" the sender wrote in a string of messages.",
      "\"I'll never do it to anyone ever again.\"",

      "According to the June 2021 warrant, police verified that the Facebook account used to send the messages belonged to Cleary.",
      "The AP doesn't typically identify sexual assault victims without their permission, which Keeler has granted.",
      "Across the U.S., very few\u00a0campus rapes\u00a0are prosecuted, both because victims fear going to police and prosecutors hesitate to bring cases that can be hard to win, an AP investigation found.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",
      "\"Indeed, it is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

    "summary": "After intense negotiations, Israel and Hamas have reached a deal that would see a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners.",
    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement to halt more than a year of fighting in the Gaza Strip, President Biden and Qatar's prime minister announced separately on Wednesday. The deal comes after a week of intense negotiations mediated by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt.",
      "\"Today, after many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage deal,\" Mr. Biden said in a written statement. \"This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity.\"",
      "Speaking from the White House Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden said, \"There was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal, and I'm deeply satisfied this day has finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel, and for the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\"",
      "He said Americans will be among the hostages released in phase one of the deal, \"and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home.\"",
      "The deal is expected to take effect Sunday, the White House said.",
      "As news of the agreement broke, crowds gathered in Deir al Bala in Gaza, and celebratory gunfire was heard.",
      "\"I'm extremely happy,\" one young Palestinian woman in the Gaza city of Khan Younis told CBS News. \"The past 15 months I experienced tears, laughters, lost martyrs and people went into prison, but finally I feel the joy.\"",
      "\"I am very happy, and today is the day I wished to hear about since the beginning of the war,\" an elderly man said. \"God is sending us hope,\" he added.",
      "The ceasefire is not yet in effect, and Israeli airstrikes continued Wednesday in Gaza City and Khan Younis after the news broke.",
      "The families of the American hostages still being held in Gaza expressed their relief at the news of a deal.",
      "\"We are deeply grateful that there is finally an agreement between Israel and Hamas to bring our loved ones \u2014 Omer, Edan, Sagui, Itay, Keith, Gad, and Judi \u2014 home,\" the families said in a statement. \"We have been waiting for 467 days while our family members suffer from life-threatening injuries, abuse, torture, and sexual violence. We thank President Biden, President-elect Trump, and their teams for their constructive efforts to make this possible.\"",
      "A draft of the deal had been agreed to in principle earlier in the week, Arab, U.S. and Israeli officials told CBS News. It sets out a phased framework for a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages still held by Hamas for a larger number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. It also includes access for humanitarian aid to Gaza and the eventual ability of Palestinians in Gaza to return to areas they fled.",
      "Intense negotiations had been underway in Doha for the past few weeks, with President Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, staying in the region for the better part of a month. McGurk has been closely coordinating with President-elect Donald Trump's pick for special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.",
      "Mr. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone on Sunday about the negotiations and again on Wednesday. A senior U.S. official described their latest conversation as \"a very warm call, marking this moment.\"",
      "In Israel, families of the approximately 100 hostages still being held after Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 2023 attack, which saw the group and allied militants kill about 1,200 people, have been holding regular rallies demanding a negotiated deal for the release of their loved ones. The Israel Defense Forces has said it believes around a third of the hostages have already died.",
      "More than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, and most of Gaza's population is displaced and living in camps. Humanitarian groups have been struggling to deliver aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "What is in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal?",
      "Details of the deal are similar to a plan outlined by Mr. Biden last year. The deal is expected to go into effect on Sunday.",
      "According to a draft from mediator sources, viewed by CBS News earlier this week, and Mr. Biden's description, it would consist of three phases, each lasting about 42 days.",
      "During the first phase, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said. The first phase will also include the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel is expected to release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "A senior Israeli official told CBS News that the release of hostages from Israel would begin on the first day of a 42-day ceasefire period. Mr. Biden said Americans will be among the first wave of hostages released.",
      "On that first day, Hamas would release three hostages, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operations in Gaza, and would begin reconstruction of the enclave's infrastructure, such as water, electricity and sewage systems.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all remaining male Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of all IDF forces from Gaza, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "The third phase would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "Trump responds to ceasefire and hostage release deal",
      "In his remarks, Mr. Biden noted that the deal will largely be implemented after his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, takes office.",
      "\"This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration,\" the president said. \"For these past few days, we've been speaking as one team.\"",
      "Trump posted on social media as news broke of the hostage and ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\" Trump wrote. \"I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.\"",
      "Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel \"to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.\"",
      "\"We have achieved so much without even being in the White House,\" Trump wrote. \"Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!\"",
      "Trump is at his Mar-a-Lago estate Wednesday, with five days to go until he becomes president.",
      "Asked how much credit Trump should get for the deal, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns: \"I would hope we would all move beyond the question of who gets credit. I mean, I don't think that the hostages are caring about that, and I don't think their families care about that. I don't think the Palestinians in Gaza care about who gets credit for this. The truth is that there's a lot of credit to go around, including in the [Mideast] region.\"",
      "Kirby said the Biden administration worked closely with their counterparts on Trump's team.",
      "\"It's important to remember that this deal was the deal that President Biden negotiated and put on the table back in May, got international support for it. That's the deal that we're talking about being implemented here,\" Kirby said. \"And it was due to a lot of intense diplomacy by American diplomats.\"",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was detained in a massive law enforcement operation at the presidential compound Wednesday, defiantly insisting the anti-corruption agency didn't have the authority to investigate his actions but saying he complied to prevent violence.",
      "In a video message recorded before he was escorted to the headquarters of the anti-corruption agency, Yoon lamented the \"rule of law has completely collapsed in this country.\"",
      "Yoon, the country's first sitting president to be apprehended, had been holed up in the Hannam-dong residence in the capital, Seoul, for weeks while vowing to \"fight to the end\" the efforts to oust him. He has justified his brief declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 as a legitimate act of governance against an \"anti-state\" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said Yoon was brought into custody about five hours after investigators arrived at the presidential compound and about three hours after they successfully entered the residence, in their second attempt to detain him over his imposition of martial law.",
      "A series of black SUVs, some equipped with sirens, were seen leaving the presidential compound with police escorts. Yoon was later seen stepping out of a vehicle after arriving at the agency's office in the nearby city of Gwacheon.",
      "Hundreds of Yoon's conservative supporters rallied near the anti-corruption agency's office as he underwent questioning, shouting slogans and holding signs that read: \"We will fight alongside President Yoon Suk Yeol.\"",
      "An unidentified man was in life-threatening condition after an apparent self-immolation near the site, according to the Gyeonggi provincial fire department.",
      "Following the questioning, Yoon was sent to a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul. He could be held in custody for weeks.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with the police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion, has 48 hours to request a court order for a formal arrest on a charge of attempting a rebellion, and if it fails to do so, Yoon will be released. If Yoon is formally arrested, investigators can extend his detention to 20 days before transferring the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "The anti-corruption agency told reporters that Yoon, during his first two hours of questioning, exercised his right to remain silent.",
      "The detainment warrant for Yoon, issued by the Seoul Western District Court, said there were substantial reasons to suspect that he committed crimes as a \"ringleader of a rebellion.\"",
      "Yoon's presidential powers were suspended when parliament impeached him on Dec. 14. The impeachment case now rests with the Constitutional Court, which could formally remove Yoon from office or reject the case and reinstate him.",
      "In a separate message posted on his Facebook account after his detainment, Yoon claimed that \"martial law is not a crime,\" saying his declaration was necessary to raise awareness about an opposition that was exercising \"legislative dictatorship by blocking laws and budgets\" and \"paralyzing\" state affairs. He denied the rebellion accusations, describing his impeachment as \"fraud.\"",
      "As they began the detention operation in the early morning, the anti-corruption investigators and police officers engaged in an hourslong standoff at the compound's gate with presidential security forces but otherwise encountered no meaningful resistance.",
      "Police officers were seen using wire cutters to remove the barbed wire placed by the presidential security service on the perimeter of the compound to block their entry. Some police officers used ladders to climb over rows of buses placed by the presidential security service near the compound's entrance, and then the investigators began moving up the hilly compound. The investigators and police later arrived in front of a metal gate with a gold presidential mark that's near Yoon's residential building. Some officers were seen entering a security door on the side of the metal gate, joined by one of Yoon's lawyers and his chief of staff. The presidential security service later removed a bus and other vehicles that had been parked tightly inside the gate as a barricade.",
      "Despite a court warrant for Yoon's detention, the presidential security service had insisted it's obligated to protect the impeached president and fortified the compound with barbed wire and rows of buses blocking paths.",
      "South Korea's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, issued a statement early Wednesday urging law enforcement and the presidential security service to ensure there are no \"physical clashes.\"",
      "Following Yoon's detainment, Choi met with diplomats from the Group of Seven nations, including the United States, Japan, Britain and Germany, as well as the representative of the European Union, to reassure them that the government was functioning stably.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative campaign that led to Yoon's impeachment on Dec. 14, said Yoon's detention is the \"first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy, and realizing the rule of law.\"",
      "As investigators moved up the hillside compound, lawmakers from Yoon's People Power Party held a rally in nearby streets, decrying the efforts to detain him as unlawful.",
      "The National Police Agency met with field commanders in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province in recent days to plan their detainment efforts, and the size of those forces fueled speculation that more than a thousand officers could be deployed. The agency and police had openly warned that presidential bodyguards obstructing the execution of the warrant could be arrested.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have claimed that the detainment warrant issued by the Seoul Western District Court was invalid. They cited a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon. They also claimed that the anti-corruption agency had no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations.",
      "\"I am truly appalled to see illegalities upon illegalities upon illegalities being carried out and procedures being forcefully conducted under an invalid warrant,\" Yoon said in the video released before his detention. \"I do not acknowledge the investigation by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials. As the president, who is responsible for upholding the constitution and legal system of the Republic of Korea, my decision to comply with such illegal and invalid procedures is not an acknowledgment of them, but rather a willingness to prevent unfortunate and bloody incidents.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday that they're discussing a potential plea deal with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the long-elusive Mexican drug lord who was arrested last summer and whose son could testify against him if he goes to trial.",
      "Assistant U.S. attorney Francisco Navarro said the plea discussions with Zambada, a leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, haven't borne fruit so far, but prosecutors want to keep trying. A judge scheduled an April 22 hearing for an update.",
      "Zambada's lead attorney, Frank Perez, declined to comment on the discussions.",
      "It's common for prosecutors and defense lawyers to explore whether they can reach a deal, and the talks don't necessarily go anywhere.",
      "Zambada was an attentive and active participant during Wednesday's hearing, which focused on whether he wanted Perez to continue representing him even while also representing a potential government witness in the case - Zambada's son Vicente Zambada.",
      "\"I don't want a different attorney,\" the father said through a court interpreter. \"I want him, even though this could be a conflict if he represents me and my son.\"",
      "The younger Zambada was charged himself and made a plea deal in the long-running and sprawling U.S. prosecutions of Sinaloa cartel figures. He testified for the government at the trial of the cartel's infamous and now imprisoned co-founder, Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Working alongside Guzm\u00e1n, Ismael Zambada kept a lower profile and was seen as concentrating more on the business of smuggling than the extremes of brutality, serving as a strategist and dealmaker who engaged with day-to-day operations, authorities say.",
      "At Guzm\u00e1n's trial, Vicente Zambada recounted how his father and Guzm\u00e1n ran the cartel together. At one point, he described corrupt Mexican politicians asking whether the syndicate could help them ship 100 tons of cocaine in an oil tanker.",
      "\"They wanted to know if my dad and Chapo could provide that amount of coke,\" he told a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where his father is being prosecuted. At another point, Vicente Zambada recalled hearing a rival drug gang leader say he wanted to kill Ismael Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n to avenge a botched hit.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court document last month that the son might be called to testify against his father, which could pose a conflict of interest for Perez. For instance, he'd be hindered in cross-examining the son because of the loyalty he owes both clients.",
      "Defense lawyers do sometimes have potential conflicts of interest regarding a client, and federal courts have outlined the steps judges should take to address such situations. Among them is having an independent lawyer advise defendants as they consider what to do about the possible conflict. Zambada had one at Wednesday's hearing.",
      "Zambada said he realized there could be problems with Perez representing him and his son - \"for example, that he will have to hide information that he obtained from Vicente from me.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ultimately agreed that Perez could stay on the case, noting that Ismael Zambada also has other lawyers who could handle any piece of it relating to his son.",
      "Law enforcement sought the elder Zambada for years before his startling arrest in July at an airport near El Paso, Texas, after arriving in a private plane with one of Guzm\u00e1n's sons, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. He, too, was wanted by U.S. authorities.",
      "Zambada has said he was kidnapped in Mexico and hauled to the U.S. by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, whose lawyer denies those claims. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his brother Ovidio are in plea negotiations with the U.S. government, their lawyers said this month in a Chicago courtroom.",
      "Following the July arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping, horrific fighting erupted in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \"Chapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons.",
      "The Chapitos have used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers,\" according to an indictment released by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "In recent months, bodies have appeared across Sinaloa, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either\u00a0sombreros on their heads\u00a0or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",
      "The chain of events also strained relations between Mexico and the United States.",
      "First, Mexico's president at the time, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and current President Claudia Sheinbaum laid part of the blame for the bloodshed at Washington's feet, saying the U.S. arrests uncorked trouble.",
      "The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, responded that it was \"incomprehensible\" to suggest the cartel wars were Washington's fault. He subsequently asserted that the Mexican government had stopped cooperating with Washington on fighting cartels and was sticking its head in the sand about violence and police corruption.",
      "Mexico's foreign ministry reacted by expressing \"surprise\" in a formal note to the U.S. embassy about the envoy's statement.",

      "The average \"normal\" blood pressure is 120/80, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "Almost half of all U.S. adults have elevated blood pressure (systolic pressure between 120 and 19 and diastolic pressure less than 80). High blood pressure (hypertension, which is when the systolic pressure is between 130 and 139 or diastolic pressure is between 80 and 89) can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke if left untreated, per the AHA.",

      "People who rested their arms on their laps drove up the top number in the blood pressure reading (systolic pressure) by nearly 4 mmHg, while leaving their arm hanging at their side increased it by nearly 7 mmHg.",
      "For the most accurate results, the guidelines are to rest the arm on a desk or another firm surface at the same level as the heart, Serwer told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The proper position is to sit upright with your feet on the floor and your legs uncrossed, resting your arm on a flat surface that is level with your heart,\" Serwer advised.",
      "Certain arm positions can lead to inflated results and misdiagnoses of hypertension, research has shown. (iStock)",
      "If the cuff is too large or small, measurements will be abnormal, the cardiologist cautioned.",
      "\"Most blood pressure monitors use either an arm cuff or a wrist cuff,\" he said. \"Arm cuffs tend to be more accurate and require fewer steps to ensure accuracy.\"",
      "Serwer said he typically asks all patients to bring their home cuff to the office, where he first measures their blood pressure manually and then uses the patient\u2019s cuff.",
      "\"We can then assess the accuracy of their cuff,\" he said.",
      "The most accurate results are obtained after sitting in a low-stress environment for five minutes, Serwer noted.",
      "\"Know your blood pressure, even if you are healthy.\"",
      "\"Avoid stimulants before measuring your pressure, as caffeine will raise it,\" Serwer said.",
      "When taking blood pressure, Serwer recommends checking it twice and waiting at least one minute between measurements.",

      "\"Blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day, so checking your pressure at the same time each day gives us a better trend,\" he added.",

      "Said Nedergaard, \"It's like turning on the dishwasher before you go to bed and waking up with a clean brain. . . . We're essentially asking what drives this process and trying to define restorative sleep based on\" this \"glymphatic clearance.\"",
      "\"It's like turning on the dishwasher before you go to bed and waking up with a clean brain.\" (iStock)",
      "The brain has a built-in waste removal process - the glymphatic system - that circulates fluid in the brain and spinal cord to clear out waste, according to the scientists.",
      "The process helps remove toxic proteins that form sticky plaques linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.",
      "But the scientists indicated that what drives the system was unclear until now, according to the study.",
      "Is all sleep created equal? The researchers wanted to find out.",

      "TRUMP'S DAYLIGHT SAVING PLAN AND SLEEP: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW",
      "They found that norepinephrine waves correlate to variations in brain blood volume \u2014 suggesting that norepinephrine triggers a rhythmic pulsation in the blood vessels. The researchers then compared the changes in blood volume to brain fluid flow.",
      "The brain fluid flow fluctuates in correspondence to blood volume changes, suggesting the vessels act as pumps to propel the surrounding brain fluid to flush out waste.",
      "During deep sleep, toxic proteins that form sticky plaques linked to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are removed, scientists say in a new study.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Natalie Hauglund of the University of Copenhagen and the University of Oxford, the study's lead author, said, \"You can view norepinephrine as [the] conductor of an orchestra.\"",

It said that its Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) has estimated that the number of illegal immigrants on its national docket who meet the criteria would be over 60,000. The letter was first reported by Politico.",

Kennedy, Jr.",
      "The case centered on whether Meta was acting outside its scope when its platform, Facebook, temporarily removed a 30-minute video posted by Kennedy, which included vaccine misinformation and other false claims about COVID-19. The Supreme Court majority declined to take up the case without explanation, but Alito disagreed, writing as the sole dissenter for the court.",

      "\"I would allow him to intervene to ensure that we can reach the merits of respondents\u2019 claims and to prevent the irreparable loss of his First Amendment rights,\" he added.",
      "\"Because Mr. Kennedy\u2019s arguments on the merits are essentially the same as respondents\u2019, allowing intervention would not significantly affect petitioners\u2019 burden with regard to that issue,\" Alito wrote. \"But the denial of intervention is likely to prevent Mr. Kennedy from vindicating the rights he claims until the spring of 2024 and perhaps as late as June of that year.

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 12:55:52 -0500",
    "summary": "A conservative nonprofit, the American Accountability Foundation, released a &quot;watch-list&quot; of 10 top &quot;left-wing&quot; bureaucrats at the Department of Education.",
    "story": [
      "American Accountability Foundation President Tom Jones tells Fox News Digital that the watch-list identifies the top bureaucrat \"ideologues\" at the Department of Education who President-elect Donald Trump should remove.",
      "FIRST ON FOX - The American Accountability Foundation, a conservative government research nonprofit, assembled a \"watch-list\" of top bureaucrats at the Department of Education who it recommends President-elect Donald Trump should fire.",
      "The AAF, which has received funding from the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation in the past, published a list on its website of 19 \"dossiers\" naming \"America's Most Subversive Education Bureaucrats.\"\u00a0AAF President Tom Jones, a former Republican congressional staffer, told Fox News Digital that the \"public-facing\" list was not compiled at the behest of the Trump transition team, but rather because the conservative organization believes it's important that the American people \"understand that there's a lot of civil servants within the federal government, and particularly within the Department of Education, who are not impartial technicians executing on the agenda of the president, but rather are ideologues who have an agenda that they're willing to implement despite the clear direction from the voters in November.\"\u00a0\"At the end of the day, it's fundamentally undemocratic. What you get is a group of people who don't reflect the will of the American people implementing their agenda over that of what the American people said was their will in November. At the end of the day, what it means is you get a left-wing approach to education, particularly higher education,\" Jones told Fox News Digital. \"The higher education system in America is broken. I think the events of last summer, where you saw left-wing pro-terrorist groups take over American campuses, and the faculty and administration support them, really should have been a wake-up call for all Americans. And I think this could be a wake-up call for this administration.\"",
      "Jones said those on the list include individuals who are \"serial donors\" to Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and President Biden, as well as other \"hard core ideologues\" who will prioritize their own progressive agendas, such as promoting Biden\u2019s student loan \"bailouts,\" increasing regulations on successful online class partnerships,\u00a0and conducting a \"witch hunt\" against Christian and career colleges through the Student Financial Aid Office of Enforcement.",

      "President Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday, April 8, 2024.\u00a0 (Daniel Steinle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Jones identified one individual at the Office of Enforcement who \"had spent his career at the Maryland Attorney General's Office investigating career colleges and Christian colleges.\" He pointed to another person who stated that he would work to turn the DOE into a \"mini-CFPB,\" a reference to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Jones described as \"essentially just a witch hunt factory that's used to investigate organizations of people that the administration doesn't like.\" The nonprofit described one general attorney for the DOE included on the list as \"a leading legal advocate for transgender rights in the debate over religious exemptions for certain universities.\"",
      "\"These people are not going to say, you know what, 'I hated Trump last week, but on January 22nd, I'm going to be super excited about implementing his education agenda.' Unless these folks are moved out of their positions within the Department of Education, they're going to continue to work behind the scenes to attack alternatives to traditional four-year institutions,\" Jones said.",
      "Others named on the list include a civilian employee within the DOE Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) who the nonprofit says spearheaded a \"$6.1 billion student loan forgiveness scheme to art institute students.\"\u00a0\"They call it relief, but it's really a huge giveaway to people who pursue college degrees that are just unaffordable,\" Jones told Fox News Digital. \"And look, that's completely unacceptable to essentially have the federal government repaying the student loans for someone and putting that burden on the back of a plumber or a welder, you know, a teacher who is taking care of their education or who didn't go on to college, they've now got to pay for some guy who's got a feminist studies degree from Columbia and $150,000 in debt. That's just simply, fundamentally unfair and wrong. But look, if you want to go get that degree, you should be prepared to pay for it.\"",

And that's just shameful. So I'm hopeful that the administration says, look, this is, you know, paying people $200,000 a year to attack opportunities for, you know, welders, nurses and folks like that to get a higher education. It's just unacceptable.\"",

      "\"At the end of the day, American people need to understand that the people we're talking about here are not technicians,\" Jones said. \"This isn't plumbing that they're doing. This is policy work. This is fundamentally ideological work. And at the end of the day, these people are just like the political appointees that can be fired at the beginning of the administration.\"",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the administration really takes the opportunity to treat them like political appointees and ask them to move on, because if they don't, they're going to get left-wing political ideology in the administration for the next four years,\" he added. \"And unfortunately, we saw some of that happen in the first administration. I'm cautiously optimistic that the administration learned their lesson the hard way, the first time that they can't let a bunch of unelected bureaucrats run roughshod over their agenda during this administration.\"",

      "The AAF assembled a similar \"watch-list\" of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees who it recommended the Trump administration clear out. In response at the time, DHS Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas condemned \"in the strongest terms any effort to harass or intimidate our public servants.\"\u00a0\"What Alejandro Mayorkas did was use the force of the Department of Homeland Security to chill speech by groups like the American Accountability Foundation,\" Jones told Fox News Digital. \"There were no examples of anyone feeling threatened, but what there were examples of was him ordering departments within the Department of Homeland Security to open investigations of AAF. That's, you know, that's the kind of weaponization of the U.S. government that we saw for four years under the Biden administration\u2026 So the idea that some folks are feeling targeted is just nonsense and a complete red herring and really a tool for Mayorkas and Biden administration officials to shut down speech that they don't just don't agree with.\"",

This study aimed to investigate whether users could control grip forces applied to two different objects simultaneously with a dexterous artificial hand.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The study's findings, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrated that multiple channels of haptic feedback allowed participants to successfully grasp and transport two objects at once without dropping them, even when visual feedback was obstructed.",

This armband included soft actuators that provided proportional contact force feedback and vibrotactile stimulators that alerted users if they were about to drop or break an object. The armband's design allowed it to deliver haptic feedback at three critical points corresponding to the thumb, index and little fingers, effectively enhancing the user's ability to control multiple objects simultaneously.",

By enabling refined dexterous control through enhanced sensory feedback, this research opens new pathways for individuals with upper limb loss to engage in complex tasks traditionally deemed impossible with current prosthetics. This includes activities such as playing musical instruments or performing intricate surgical procedures.",

      "Apple\u2019s Macs are generally considered more secure than Windows PCs, but they are not immune to hackers. Numerous incidents demonstrate that Macs are not impenetrable, and a new one has recently been added to the list. Security researchers have discovered a new variant of stealer malware that targets browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets and other personal data. I\u00a0reported on this malware in 2024 as well. Previously, it relied on macOS browser extensions to steal data. Now, it uses phishing websites and fake GitHub repositories to target Macs, which have a user base of 100 million people.",

      "The evolution of info-stealer Mac malware",
      "Cybersecurity company\u00a0Check Point has discovered a new variant of info-stealer malware, BanShee. Elastic Security Labs first highlighted this malware in mid-2024, noting that it operates as malware-as-a-service, a business model in which cybercriminals provide access to malicious software and related infrastructure for a fee. At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "How the Mac malware operates",
      "BanShee Stealer is a prime example of how advanced malware has become. Once it\u2019s on a system, it gets straight to work stealing all kinds of sensitive information. It goes after data from browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge and Vivaldi, as well as cryptocurrency wallet extensions. It even takes advantage of two-factor authentication (2FA) extensions to grab credentials. On top of that, it collects details about the device\u2019s software and hardware, as well as the external IP address.",
      "The Mac malware also tricks users with fake pop-ups that look like real system prompts, tricking victims into entering their macOS passwords. Once it has gathered the stolen information, BanShee exfiltrates it to command-and-control servers, using encrypted and encoded files to ensure the data remains secure.",
      "The malware\u2019s creators used GitHub repositories to spread BanShee. They set up fake repositories that looked like they hosted popular software, complete with stars and reviews, to seem trustworthy. These campaigns didn\u2019t just target macOS users with BanShee. They also hit Windows users with a different\u00a0malware called Lumma Stealer. Over three waves, the attackers used these fake repositories to trick people into downloading their malicious files.",

      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5)\u00a0Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene. It's crucial to know what you\u2019re downloading, ensure it\u2019s from a trusted source and carefully review the permissions you grant to any online service or application.",

      "13) Try out the new Passwords app",
      "I always stress the importance of using a password manager to store your passwords. Let\u2019s be honest, we all have a ton of apps and services that require an account and password. If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "14) Use ChatGPT and writing tools",
      "Apple introduced Apple Intelligence for iPhone 15 Pro and newer models running iOS 18.2, bringing a range of AI tools and ChatGPT support. ChatGPT is now built into various parts of iOS, and if you have an iPhone 15 Pro or above, you can take full advantage of this integration.",
      "You can use Apple's enhanced Writing Tools to access ChatGPT directly in apps like Notes, Mail and any other text input field.

Start by updating to iOS 18.2 or later to access the latest features. Next, security measures like a passcode or biometric authentication should be set up for added protection.

The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",

      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

The first two versions of the Starship were powered by diesel engines, achieving notable fuel efficiencies compared to industry standards. However, the introduction of the Cummins X15N natural gas engine in the Starship 3.0 represents a pivotal shift away from diesel, addressing both environmental concerns and operational efficiency.",
      "The X15N engine, launched in 2024, is designed specifically for heavy-duty applications and overcomes previous limitations associated with natural gas as a fuel source.

This adaptability not only enhances its eco-friendliness but also positions it as a practical option for fleets looking to transition away from traditional fuels.",
      "Weight reduction: The new engine is approximately 500 pounds lighter than its diesel counterpart, which increases the potential freight-carrying capacity of the truck. This weight reduction is complemented by other lightweight materials used in the truck's construction, contributing to an impressive ton-miles per gallon efficiency of 183, compared to an industry average of 72.",
      "Aerodynamic design: The Starship 3.0 features a sleek design with curved edges and optimized aerodynamics that reduce wind resistance. Additional enhancements like low rolling resistance tires and integrated aerodynamic panels further contribute to its efficiency.",
      "Advanced lubricants: Shell has developed specialized lubricants tailored for the higher temperatures generated by natural gas engines. The truck uses Shell Rotella NG Plus SAE 5W-30 synthetic oil, formulated specifically for this purpose, alongside advanced transmission lubricants that improve overall performance.",
      "Real-world testing: The input from experienced truck drivers, such as brothers Brian and Eric Rector, has been invaluable in refining the Starship's design and functionality.

    "summary": "PowerSchool, which serves over 60 million students and teachers globally, has become the latest target of cybercriminals. Millions of records were stolen.",
    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Cybercriminals spare no industry, targeting sectors like health care, insurance, automotive and education. Health care has been a frequent target, with attacks like the Ascension breach last year and the CVR incident in late 2024.",
      "Now, education technology giant PowerSchool has become the latest target, with records of millions of students and teachers stolen.",
      "While the exact number of affected individuals remains unknown, the scale of the breach is alarming.",
      "PowerSchool serves 18,000 customers worldwide, including schools in the U.S. and Canada, managing grading, attendance and personal information for over 60 million K-12 students and teachers.",

      "Kids working on their laptops\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How did hackers target PowerSchool",
      "PowerSchool revealed a cybersecurity breach to its customers Jan. 7, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. The company said it discovered the breach Dec. 28, after customer data from its PowerSchool SIS platform was stolen through the PowerSource support portal.",
      "PowerSchool SIS is a student information system used for managing grades, attendance, enrollment and other student records. Hackers accessed the PowerSource portal using stolen credentials and used an \"export data manager\" tool to steal information.",
      "The company said this wasn\u2019t a ransomware attack or a result of software flaws, but rather a straightforward network break-in. The company has hired a third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the breach, figure out what happened and determine who was affected.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "UNDERSTANDING BRUSHING SCAMS AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "What data got stolen",
      "The PowerSource portal includes a feature that allows PowerSchool engineers to access customer systems for support and troubleshooting. The attacker exploited this feature to export the PowerSchool SIS \"students\" and \"teachers\" database tables to a CSV file, which was then stolen.",
      "PowerSchool confirmed the stolen data primarily includes contact details like names and addresses. However, for some districts, the data may also include sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, personally identifiable information, medical records and grades.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The company said customer support tickets, credentials and forum data were not accessed or stolen during the breach. PowerSchool also emphasized that not all SIS customers were affected and expects only a subset of customers will need to notify those affected.",
      "\"We do not anticipate the data being shared or made public, and we believe it has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination,\" the developer told customers in a notice.",
      "\"We have also deactivated the compromised credential and restricted all access to the affected portal. Lastly, we have conducted a full password reset and further tightened password and access control for all PowerSource customer support portal accounts.\"",
      "PowerSchool said affected adults will be offered free credit monitoring, while minors will receive subscriptions to an unspecified identity protection service.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from PowerSchool data breach",
      "The PowerSchool data breach has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant about your personal information. Here are five steps you can take to protect yourself:",
      "1. Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and any online services linked to your personal information. Watch for unauthorized transactions or changes to your accounts that could signal misuse of your data.",
      "2. Freeze your credit: If your Social Security number or other sensitive details were compromised, consider placing a credit freeze with major credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This prevents potential identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "3. Use identity theft protection services:\u00a0Take advantage of any identity protection services offered by PowerSchool as part of its breach response. These services can alert you to suspicious activity and provide support if your identity is stolen.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One of the best parts of some identity protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Wherever possible, enable\u00a02FA for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text code or app-generated token, to access your accounts.",
      "5. Be aware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software: Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to exploit data breaches. Avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or text messages, especially those claiming to be from PowerSchool or your school district.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You can blame hackers for this breach, but PowerSchool shares the responsibility for failing to adequately protect sensitive data. The company may also be in violation of data privacy agreements it signed with school districts, as well as federal and state laws designed to safeguard student privacy. What\u2019s more concerning is that PowerSchool took nearly two weeks to notify its customers about the breach. Schools are now left scrambling to assess the full extent of the intrusion. This delay is not just irresponsible; it puts students, parents and teachers at heightened risk of cyberattacks and identity theft.",

    "summary": "United Aerial Firefighters Association head Paul Petersen said the wildfires ravaging California could be among the most devastating in U.S. history, and hopes they &quot;wake up&quot; lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Paul Petersen, head of the United Aerial Firefighters Association, said that wildfires raging in Southern California are among the deadliest and costly fires in U.S. history.",
      "The head of the United Aerial Firefighters Association, which has deployed about 200 pilots to Southern California to fight massive ongoing wildfires, told Fox News Digital that the scope of the fires is \"totally demoralizing\" and shaping up to be some of the worst in the nation's history.",
      "\"What we are seeing, especially in the United States and worldwide, is there is no longer a fire season \u2013 it is fire year-round,\" Paul Petersen said on Wednesday. \"[This] could end up being one of the deadliest and most climate-costliest fires in U.S. history.\"",
      "Aerial firefighters with the association are limited to eight-hour shifts in the air, like airline pilots. However, Petersen said, they are on 24-hour shifts. At night, he said, pilots are outfitted with night vision goggles. From the air, they communicate the position of the flames to firefighters on the ground and spray water or retardant substances from above.",
      "Among the aircraft supplied by the association are helicopters, like Blackhawks and ACH 47 Chinooks, and air tankers, like Grumman S-2T and Lockheed C-130H planes, carrying thousands of gallons of water. They also supply \"scooper\" planes, which \"scoop water from oceans, lakes and reservoirs which can be dropped as regular water or be mixed with a foam retardant,\" according to Cal Fire.",

Cal Fire currently has over 60 planes and helicopters within its firefighting fleet; Cal Fire also counts three King Air A200 twin-turboprop planes among its \"air tactical aircraft.\" The Air National Guard has flown C-130 Hercules planes \"equipped with Modular Aerial Fire Fighting Systems\" to the Los Angeles area, where they are operating missions.",
      "\"I've seen just the pictures, and I've talked to fire chiefs that are down there \u2013 they [are] ensuring that the devastation is worse than what you see on TV, that it's worse than what you can imagine,\" he continued. \"And from a firefighter's perspective, it is just totally demoralizing because firefighters are there to solve problems and their people call them when it's their worst day.

The Palisades Fire, which has consumed more than 23,000 acres in the Los Angeles area, is only 19% contained, according to the agency.",

      "\"There's a couple of different components of [this],\" Petersen said of why these latest fires are so devastating. \"When you have extreme weather, and you have the Santa Ana winds that are blowing, you know, 50, 60, 70, 80 miles an hour, and then you introduce fire into that\u2026 it just moves so rapidly that people are unprepared for it.",
      "\"Communities that are unprepared for it, firefighters are surprised by it\u2026 When you start losing home after home and blocks after blocks after blocks, you're just trying to figure out how do we stop this? And, you know, there's really no playbook of how to stop a fire.\"",
      "Fox News Digital previously reported that the city's fire hydrants ran out of water as firefighters worked to stop the flames, and that the department's budget was slashed just weeks before the Palisades Fire broke out.",
      "\"Without increased funding for wildland fire, we're going to continue to see this over and over again,\" Petersen said. \"[It's] not only recognizing that it is a year-round fire season, but also having the funding and the money to invest not only for fire suppression, but for hazardous fuels, for hardening communities. U.S. needs to get it, you know, take this seriously, that you have to do all things in order to protect communities from wildfire.\"",

You have to fight the fire you have. But there also has to be fuel treatments, logging, grazing, green stripping. There also has to be incentives from insurance companies for fire-adapted communities. All three of those have to work and in one fell swoop in order to do that.\"",

      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court on Thursday denied a request by former President Jair Bolsonaro to temporarily restore his passport so that he could attend the inauguration in Washington of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump next week.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who Bolsonaro frequently has called his personal foe, said in the ruling that Bolsonaro currently holds no position that would allow him to represent Brazil at the event and that the former president did not adequately prove to the court that he had been invited.",
      "HOW BRAZILIAN POLICE SAY BOLSONARO PLOTTED A COUP TO STAY IN OFFICE",
      "Bolsonaro, under several wide-ranging investigations including over an alleged attempt to stay in office despite his electoral defeat, had his passport seized by federal police last February because he was considered a flight risk. He denies the allegations against him.",
      "Bolsonaro responded to the verdict Thursday on X by accusing Brazil\u2019s judicial system of political persecution against him, comparing his situation to legal cases in the U.S. against Trump. He said that Trump \"overcame the judicial activism. I too will overcome it.\"",
      "The former Brazilian president had requested permission to leave the country from Jan. 17 to 22 to attend the inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20 and a Hispanic inaugural ball. Bolsonaro, an outspoken admirer of Trump, said on his social media channels on Jan. 8 that he was \"very happy with this invitation.\"",

      "Still, de Moraes argued that Bolsonaro had not adequately proven that he was invited to the inauguration. In the ruling, de Moraes followed the recommendation of Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who said Wednesday that Bolsonaro's private interest in the trip did not outweigh the public interest in prohibiting him from traveling abroad.",
      "De Moraes said Bolsonaro remains a flight risk and added that the former president has advocated that his supporters who face legal troubles in cases involving their political allegiance should leave the country and seek asylum. Hundreds of Bolsonaro's supporters involved in Jan. 8, 2023 riots in capital Brasilia have left Brazil to avoid prosecution.",

      "Last November, federal police formally accused Bolsonaro and 36 others, including high-ranking military officers, of attempting a coup. Gonet, the prosecutor-general, will decide whether to charge Bolsonaro or toss the investigation.",
      "Legal experts believe Bolsonaro could be charged and stand trial in the second half of 2025 at the Supreme Court for allegedly falsifying his COVID-19 vaccination status. Analysts also say there\u2019s a reasonable chance he stands trial before 2026 over allegedly embezzling jewels gifted by Saudi Arabian authorities.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, part of a European show of support and promises to keep helping Ukraine endure in its nearly three-year war with Russia.",
      "The announcement came days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president with skepticism of America\u2019s military burden in Europe and what he says is a plan to end the continent\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II.",
      "UK PM STARMER HITS BACK AGAINST MUSK ATTACKS ON CHILD GROOMING GANGS: 'LIES AND MISINFORMATION'",
      "\"We are with you not just today or tomorrow, for this year or the next, but for 100 years \u2014 long after this terrible war is over and Ukraine is free and thriving once again,\" Starmer told Zelenskyy during a visit to Kyiv, promising that the U.K. would \"play our part\" in guaranteeing Ukraine's post-war security.",
      "Starmer said that the landmark century-long agreement commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s alignment with the West, and potential future membership in NATO, have angered Russian President Vladimir Putin, who still wants to exert influence over the independent nation.",
      "While Starmer was meeting with Zelenskyy at the presidential palace, debris from Russian drones shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defenses fell in at least four districts of Kyiv, according to city administration chief Tymur Tkachenko.

Trump has also indicated that he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Ukrainians worry that Trump\u2019s plan will demand unpalatable concessions, such as giving up territory. Zelenskyy has also said that he wants security guarantees to deter Russia from invading again in the future.",
      "\"We must look at how this war could end, the practical ways to get a just and lasting peace \u2026 that guarantees your security, your independence and your right to choose your own future,\" Starmer said at a joint news conference.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the two leaders had discussed an idea floated by Macron for Western troops to monitor a future ceasefire, but said that it\u2019s \"a bit too early to talk about details.\"",
      "Starmer left the door open to U.K. participation, telling Ukraine's leader that \"we will work with you and all of our allies on steps that would be robust enough to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security.\"",
      "\"Those conversations will continue for many months ahead,\" Starmer said.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously discussed a potential peacekeeping force with Baltic countries, France and Poland. But he said that it could only be part of the security solution and noted that \"we do not consider security guarantees without the United States.\"",
      "Starmer agreed that Washington's role in Ukraine is \"vital.\" The United States is the biggest provider of military support and advanced weaponry to the country.",
      "\"We will continue to work with the U.S. on this,\" Starmer said.",
      "Starmer said that in 2025, the U.K. will give Ukraine \"more military support than ever before.\" He said that his country has already committed 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) for military aid this year, including 150 more artillery barrels and a U.K.-designed mobile air defense system named Gravehawk. The U.K. has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($15.6 billion) in military and civilian aid since the war broke out.",
      "During the daylong visit, Starmer and Zelenskyy laid flowers at a wall of remembrance for those killed in the war.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Months after South African authorities initially cut off supplies to miners working illegally in an abandoned gold mine, rescuers brought dozens of bodies and emaciated survivors to the surface Tuesday with hundreds more still believed to be underground, many of them dead and others too weak to come out on their own.",
      "At least 60 bodies and 92 survivors had been pulled from one of South Africa's deepest mines since Monday in a red cagelike device lowered thousands of feet underground, police said. Police are uncertain how many miners remain inside but said it is likely in the hundreds. Another nine bodies were brought out Friday in a community-led rescue effort, according to a group representing the miners.",
      "DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 13 IN SOUTH AFRICA MINING DISASTER",
      "The mine has been the scene of a tense standoff between police, miners and members of the local community since authorities launched an operation in November to force the miners out by cutting off food and water from the surface for a period of time. At the time, a Cabinet minister said the aim was to \"smoke them out\" and the government would not send help because they were \"criminals.\"",
      "But that tactic has been fiercely criticized by civic groups and the community, and the South African government is under scrutiny for the way it has dealt with the issue at the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine, where more than 100 miners are believed to have died underground of starvation or dehydration, according to the group representing them.",
      "Rescue workers assist an illegal miner who has been trapped deep in an abandoned gold mine for months, in Stilfontein, South Africa, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)",
      "Authorities, who removed the ropes and pulley system miners used to enter and to lower supplies, say the survivors are able to come out but refuse to because of fear of arrest. That has been disputed by the civic groups, which won a court case to force authorities to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners. But they say the supplies aren\u2019t enough and many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep.",
      "Residents desperately waiting for news of family members gathered at the mine Tuesday near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, some holding placards criticizing authorities for their response. One sign said there had been a \"Sacrifice at Stilfontein\" while some handcuffed survivors were led away in a line by police.",
      "The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official effort by authorities began Monday. They say a proper rescue operation should have been launched months ago.",
      "\"We are happy that this operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\" said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups.",
      "Authorities have grappled with informal mining for years",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter them illegally in a search for leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe visited the site Tuesday and said that more than 1,500 miners who resurfaced from the Buffelsfontein mine have been arrested since authorities began a larger crackdown on illegal mining in late 2023. He said the vast majority were foreign nationals from neighboring countries.",
      "Police have also doubled down on their assertion that the miners who are still underground aren't coming out because they are afraid of being arrested.",
      "Activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there, but many are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. The group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine.",
      "\"The last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\"",
      "Cellphone videos emerge from underground",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow supplies to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos that they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic.

      "While India has been gradually increasing its engagement with the Taliban, this latest meeting represents the highest-level talks since the Islamic group's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Notably, this was the second meeting between officials from New Delhi and Kabul in just two months, indicating both countries' readiness to step up diplomatic engagement.",
      "\"We shouldn\u2019t overstate the impact of Pakistan\u2019s tensions with the Taliban on India\u2019s stepped up engagement with the Taliban. New Delhi had already taken some small steps toward Taliban engagement soon after the Taliban\u2019s return to power, before tensions crept into the Taliban\u2019s relations with Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, tells Fox News Digital.",

      "India is among several countries actively facilitating trade, aid and medical support to Afghanistan under the Taliban regime. The country, which hosts thousands of Afghan refugees, also pledged to provide \"material support\" for their rehabilitation back in Afghanistan.",
      "\"New Delhi\u2019s outreach to the Taliban is driven by the view that closer engagement can help India better pursue its security and strategic interests in Afghanistan \u2013 and these include strengthening trade and connectivity links and ensuring India isn\u2019t threatened by terrorists on Afghan soil,\" Kugelman explained.",
      "BIDEN ADMIN'S AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL FAILURES DETAILED IN REPORT",
      "The discussions also touched on enhancing trade via the Chabahar Port in Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province. India has been developing the Chabahar Port to enable goods to bypass ports in its rival, Pakistan. This strategic port, which lies just across the border from Pakistan, could provide landlocked Afghanistan with an alternative route to receive and send goods, circumventing Pakistan.",

India and Pakistan are long-standing rivals, having fought three wars over Kashmir since both countries gained independence in 1947. This meeting also takes place amid deteriorating relations between the Taliban regime and Pakistan, once considered friendly neighbors, as cross-border violence escalates.",

      "The talks occurred just days after India \"unequivocally\" condemned Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan in late December. These rare airstrikes resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including women and children. Pakistani officials claimed the strikes targeted militants of the Pakistani Taliban.

Although no foreign government, including India, has officially recognized the Taliban administration since it swept to power in 2021, India reopened its embassy in Kabul less than a year after the Taliban's return to power.",
      "\"Islamabad has already seen its relations with its former Taliban asset take a major tumble,\" Kugelman, said. \"Now it must grapple with the fact that its rival India may fill the vacuum left by Pakistan\u2019s distancing from the Taliban.

The weakening of Iran, due to conflicts in the Middle East and internal issues, has diminished its influence over the Taliban. At the same time, Russia, one of India's closest allies, is moving toward recognizing the Taliban government in Afghanistan, even calling the group a partner in combating terrorism. Moscow perceives a significant security threat from Islamist militant groups across countries from Afghanistan to the Middle East, especially after losing Bashar al-Assad in Syria.",

Trump's re-election could now introduce new dynamics to the region, prompting India to safeguard its long-term interests.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:36:04 GMT",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden leaves behind a complicated legacy of legislative wins, economic gains and fractured relationships and grievances within his own party.",
    "story": [
      "Joe Biden ascended to the highest office in America with a pledge to unite the country, strengthen his party and defend democracy.",
      "Instead, in the 82-year-old\u2019s Oval Office denouement, he leaves a nation divided, a party in tatters and the American people questioning the self-described institutionalist\u2019s respect for the rule of law.",
      "Many Democrats are blaming Biden for handing the White House to Donald Trump, criticizing the aging politician for staying in office too long and reeling after he pardoned his son. Exacerbating the frustrations, Biden recently expressed doubt about his ability to serve another four years after dismissing voters\u2019 concerns about that very issue as he sought re-election.",
      "The president harbors similar resentment toward members of his own party. After the November election, he privately mused about the idea of pardoning Trump as a magnanimous move, according to a person directly familiar with his comments, though it\u2019s not clear he seriously considered it. A White House official said \u201cto our knowledge, this was not raised.\u201d At the same time, Biden is not on speaking terms with some of his closest allies.",
      "It is all an inglorious coda to five decades in public office.",
      "\u201cThe Joe Biden story is one of the great tragedies of American politics. I really mean that.\u00a0He should be having a glorious, well deserved, highly acclaimed retirement. And he\u2019s not,\u201d\u00a0veteran Democratic political strategist James Carville said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to blame anybody but him.\u201d",
      "Biden plans to write another book, providing him with the opportunity to tell his version of his presidency and its conclusion. Despite public polls showing in 2023 that Democratic voters did not want him to run again, he went forward anyway, with the backing of party insiders. He was later forced to step aside in July following a cataclysmic debate that seemed to expose his cognitive state. His late departure gave Vice President Kamala Harris just 107 days to build an ultimately unsuccessful campaign against Trump.",
      "Throughout his presidency, Biden granted fewer interviews than his recent predecessors and is ending his term the same way: He does not plan to hold the traditional final formal news conference.",
      "White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Biden is proud of the number of interviews and impromptu question-and-answer sessions he\u2019s held with reporters.",
      "In the White House, the mood feels \u201clike a morgue,\u201d according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don\u2019t appreciate. Privately, he has vacillated from feeling melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy, two people close to him said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s totally dejected and the people around him are, as well,\u201d another person close to the president said. One White House official attributed the glum atmosphere to Trump\u2019s impending return to the Oval Office and noted that Biden\u2019s aides warmly reacted with cheers when he surprised them at a staff party earlier this week.",
      "Another White House official depicted personnel as holding back on emotions until Jan. 20 actually arrives.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to reflect, it\u2019s hard for it to sink in that we\u2019re done here \u2014 until we\u2019re actually done and out the gates with our stuff,\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. That\u2019s their mood \u2026 it hasn\u2019t sunk in for people who are still here yet because we\u2019re working until the last minute.\u201d",
      "A uniter's many fractured friendships",
      "Once the elder statesman who was to serve as a bridge to the next generation of leadership, Biden departs with an array of fractured relationships. He is estranged from some of the people who were once among his most powerful allies. He harbors, along with first lady Jill Biden, a simmering resentment toward former President Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several former aides, including Bob Bauer and Anita Dunn, all of whom he believes either failed him or pushed him out of the 2024 race, according to several people close to him.",
      "Biden hasn\u2019t spoken in months to Dunn, a former top adviser who was among the few notable Democrats willing to back him if he decided to mount a 2016 campaign to challenge Hillary Clinton for the party\u2019s nomination, according to multiple people familiar with the dynamic. Dunn departed the White House during the summer as part of the fallout from Biden\u2019s June debate performance.",
      "Biden\u2019s relationship with Bauer, his longtime personal lawyer who is married to Dunn, also has deteriorated since the debate and tensions related to the criminal trials of his son Hunter Biden, the people familiar with the situation said. Neither Bauer nor Dunn attended a large black-tie dinner the Bidens hosted in November to thank longtime supporters.",
      "And Bauer will no longer represent Biden once he leaves office, three people familiar with the decision said.",
      "Asked about this deterioration of his relationship with Dunn and Bauer, a Biden aide said, \u201cAnita and Bob are well regarded and loyal to the president.\u201d",
      "While Biden and Pelosi have crossed paths at social events since she pushed for him to end his candidacy in July, they have not had a substantive conversation, according to a Pelosi aide.",
      "\u201cThat relationship is permanently damaged,\u201d a person close to Biden said.",
      "Biden has not expressed his frustrations with Obama directly to him, a person familiar with their conversations said.",
      "One former top Obama aide who publicly argued after the June debate that Biden should drop out pointedly noted this week that Biden recently named aircraft carriers after former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, he has not offered any similar honor to Obama.",
      "\u201cBarack H. Obama did not get a f---ing personnel carrier named after him,\u201d Ben Rhodes said on the podcast \u201cPod Save The World.\u201d",
      "Before he left office, Obama surprised Biden by awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in an emotional White House ceremony.",
      "Asked about the president\u2019s frustrations with Pelosi and Obama, Bates, the White House spokesperson, said in a statement, \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s focus is squarely on making as big of a difference as he can in the lives of American families \u2014 not events from the campaign.\u201d",
      "Family drama crashes into the White House",
      "Biden went back on his promise to protect the norms he said undergirded the nation\u2019s stability by pardoning his Hunter Biden on federal gun and tax charges. The president blamed \u201craw politics\u201d for his son\u2019s prosecution, saying it \u201cinfected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,\u201d tapping the kind of language Trump often uses.",
      "Biden was surprised, and angered, by Democrats\u2019 criticism of the pardon, according to multiple people familiar with his reaction. Dunn was among those who publicly criticized the move.",
      "Throughout his term, Biden felt the tug-of-war between his White House inner circle and his family members. Some of his family felt at times that the president was not being served well by his team, which has included Dunn, former top White House aide and then campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and longtime close advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. That was particularly the case as the 2024 campaign got into full swing and Biden\u2019s approval rating continued to sag while Trump gained ground among voters.",
      "Biden didn\u2019t make changes to his team until after he dropped out of the 2024 race. In the weeks and months after that gut-wrenching decision, anger intensified from some of his family members toward his closest aides.",
      "In some instances, it flowed both ways. Dunn and Bauer resented being unceremoniously cast out of the president\u2019s inner circle and blamed two Biden family members in particular for that \u2014 Hunter Biden and Jill Biden.",
      "Aspects of the\u00a0 family drama could continue into the next administration. Some members of the president\u2019s staff are bracing for possible congressional investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s pardon and accusations, denied by the White House, that administration officials covered up the extent of Biden\u2019s mental decline.",
      "The unsung hero",
      "Biden has argued that he set up the country for long-term economic success after shepherding major pieces of legislation through Congress \u2014 even if Americans don\u2019t feel the benefits now. He also sees his efforts to unite U.S. allies around Ukraine after Russia\u2019s invasion as a critical foreign policy achievement.",
      "In a major development Wednesday, Israel and Hamas struck a deal for a ceasefire after 15 months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. Biden worked to achieve a ceasefire deal for months, but he now shares some credit for it with Trump, given their two teams coordinated on the round of negotiations that secured the agreement.",
      "When reporters asked Biden at a Wednesday news conference whether he or Trump deserves credit for the ceasefire, Biden turned and smiled: \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d",
      "Bates, the White House spokesperson, said of the president\u2019s record in office: \u201cPresident Biden put his unique qualification and his whole heart into delivering for the American people, and the results are the strongest record of any modern administration.\u201d",
      "Critics have relentlessly hit Biden for softening border policies early on in his administration, prompting a surge in illegal crossings. While he later tightened controls at the border, public opinion had already swung against him.",
      "Some Democrats said Biden missed the mark early on when it came to the economy. He should have spent more time railing against greedy corporations rather than trying to convince the public the economy really was better than it thought, said Pete Giangreco, a veteran in presidential Democratic politics.",
      "\u201cThere was always this internal struggle from the day he walked into the White House: Was he Joe from Scranton, the populist, union guy? Or is he Joe the senator from Delaware, which is corporate friendly?\u201d Giangreco said. \u201cHe could never make up his mind who he was. If he had been Joe from Scranton from day one and stayed Joe from Scranton from day one, it might have been a different outcome.\u201d",
      "Biden paid a political price for the pandemic-era policies of the last two presidencies, said Lynn Vavreck, an American politics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Many voters became accustomed to the subsidies the Trump and the Biden administrations doled out and then watched prices go up as the subsidies ran out \u2014 a double whammy that hit when Trump was long gone from office.",
      "\u201cThey believed that they were better off financially during the Trump presidency,\u201d Vavreck said. \u201cThat is probably true for very, very many people because of those government stimulus payments and all of the support\u201d for aid programs.",
      "But another longtime ally, prominent Democratic donor John Morgan, said that Biden is right to feel bitter by the lack of fanfare around his presidency, pointing to massive investments in infrastructure, a booming stock market, low unemployment and for having navigated the pandemic \u201cmasterfully.\u201d",
      "\u201cObjectively, I believe it was a great presidency. You know they believe it. You can hear it in the president\u2019s voice,\u2019\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou look at all the statistics and it\u2019s like: \u2018Why aren\u2019t you all carrying me on your shoulders?\u2019\u201d",
      "In the immediate term, it has all done little to move the public. Biden is poised to leave office with a 36% approval rating, according to a CNN poll released Wednesday. Low approval numbers dogged him throughout his presidency and now he\u2019s particularly smarting over leaving office without his standing with Americans having improved, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In an alternate universe, one in which Biden would have stepped aside as the Democratic nominee in 2023, the president would have ridden waves of accolades in his final weeks, cutting ribbons at airports named in his honor or banking hundreds of millions of dollars for an Ivy League policy center in his name, Carville suggested.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden had many successful acts in his life. Unfortunately, you get remembered for your last act,\u201d Carville said. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s remembered as the guy who stayed too long.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:11:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The Colorado apartment complex where armed alleged members of a Venezuelan gang were seen on video breaking into an occupied unit will be closed.",
    "story": [
      "DENVER \u2014 The apartment complex where armed alleged members of a Venezuelan gang were seen on video breaking into an occupied unit, fueling Donald Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to target migrants, has been ordered closed by the city of Aurora, Colorado.",
      "The Edge at Lowry will close sometime next month after the city was granted an emergency court order to shut down the five-building complex because it has become a criminal nuisance, city spokesman Ryan S. Luby said Wednesday.",
      "The city filed the petition last week after several armed and suspected members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang also known as TDA, were alleged to have kidnapped, bound and pistol-whipped two people at the complex last month.",
      "City officials did not say what set off the dispute.",
      "\u201cWe needed to get ahold of that property because it was being completely unmanaged,\u201d City Attorney Pete Schulte said at a news conference this week. \u201cNobody at that premise is going to prevent individuals from committing crimes.\u201d",
      "He said the complex and its intruders posed an imminent threat to the public\u2019s welfare and safety.",
      "Nine of the 16 people involved in the alleged kidnapping are charged with various counts, including first-degree assault, aggravated robbery and extortion, the Aurora Police Department said in a statement.",
      "It was unclear whether any of the 16 were gang members. Police said all were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "About 60 units in the complex are occupied, including some vacant apartments that gang members and squatters are using illegally, city officials said, adding that they are\u00a0working with Arapahoe County and other community partners to provide relocation assistance for legitimate residents.",
      "During an investigation, officers found guns hidden in the walls of some units, city officials said. Records indicate officers searched five apartments on Dec. 17 and found at least three handguns, extended magazines and multiple knives.",
      "The building is owned by Five Dallas Partners LLC and operated by CBZ Management LLC. Neither responded to requests by phone and email for comment.",
      "The apartment buildings drew national attention in August when a viral video surfaced of armed suspected gang members breaking into an occupied unit.",
      "Trump, then on the campaign trail, took aim at Aurora, claiming the city had been overtaken by Venezuelan gangs, and he repeatedly claimed during a presidential debate that the TDA had taken over the apartments.",
      "Weeks later, during a campaign rally in Aurora, Trump revealed his plans to target undocumented gang members in the mass deportations he said would begin once he took office. He called his initiative \u201cOperation Aurora.\u201d",
      "At the time, local authorities acknowledged the gang had a small presence in the city, but they insisted it had not taken over the complex. Some residents agreed the allegations were overblown, but others said they believed it was happening.",
      "As of July 2024, there were 435,719 convicted criminal immigrants in the U.S. who were not under Immigration and Customs Enforcement Detention, according to the federal agency. It did not say how many of them may have been gang members.",
      "The alleged kidnapping last month sealed the fate of the Edge at Lowry, which city officials called a distressed property with many \u201cunlawful tenants who moved into vacant apartments without applying for a lease or application.\u201d",
      "Mayor Mike Coffman declined to comment.",
      "At the news conference announcing the closing, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said, \u201cThe city of Aurora has seen a major problem that\u2019s been infecting our community.\u201d He said the property was \u201ccrime-infested.\u201d",
      "Jessica Prosser, Aurora\u2019s director of Housing and Community Services, said the property is uninhabitable, citing trash abatement orders and $70,000 in outstanding water, utilities and gas bills."

      "A sheriff\u2019s office in New York\u00a0defended\u00a0two\u00a0deputies who detained and handcuffed an 11-year-old girl this week, saying she matched the description of a suspect. The Onondaga County Sheriff\u2019s Office, responding to criticism after a video of the encounter was posted online,\u00a0called the deputies\u2019 actions \u201creasonable\u201d but said\u00a0it would change its policy to notify a parent or guardian of any child who is detained for criminal investigative purposes, which it did not do in this instance.",
      "The deputies handcuffed the 11-year-old, who has not been publicly identified, for seven minutes Monday afternoon in Syracuse, according to a timeline of her detainment released by the sheriff\u2019s office, which said she was dressed similarly to a person who was wanted in connection with the theft of a car. The girl was detained a few blocks from where the stolen car was initially observed, the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "The wanted person, who, like the girl, is Black, has not been identified or captured. The dashcam of a deputy\u2019s patrol vehicle recorded her as she was fleeing from the stolen vehicle, the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "A woman who identified herself on Facebook as the 11-year-old\u2019s mother and shared videos of the girl\u2019s interaction with the deputies could not immediately be reached for comment. Her Facebook post had been shared nearly 6,000 times as of early Thursday afternoon and garnered more than 130 comments, the vast majority of them criticizing the sheriff\u2019s office for having handcuffed the girl and not having notified her parents that she had been detained.",
      "In the video, the girl stands with two deputies on a snow-filled sidewalk with her hands cuffed behind her back. One of the deputies tells the children who were with her that they can keep going, but one of them responds that she has to stay with the girl because they\u2019re related.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave her,\u201d one of the children says.",
      "One of the children tells the deputies that they were coming from school. The female deputy tells the handcuffed girl that someone wearing \u201cthe exact same thing you\u2019re wearing just stole a car,\u201d prompting one of the children to respond: \u201cWe can\u2019t drive.\u201d",
      "The female deputy tells her: \u201cWhat do you mean? Most kids can\u2019t drive, and they\u2019re still out here stealing cars.\u201d",
      "The children tell the deputies they had been playing in the snow on their way home from school.",
      "The deputies tell the children that the wanted person was wearing an outfit similar to the 11-year-old girl\u2019s \u2014 a pink jacket and camouflage pants.",
      "\u201cThe exact same description,\u201d the male deputy says.",
      "The female deputy tells the children that she\u2019s waiting to be sent a picture of the person and that if it isn\u2019t the girl they detained, they will let her go.",
      "Once the deputy receives the photo, she holds up her cellphone and asks the child she detained: \u201cGirl, you\u2019re gonna tell me this ain\u2019t you?\u201d",
      "The children gather around the deputy to view the photo and point out the disparities between the girl and the wanted person, including differences in their complexions and the shoes they were wearing. At one point in the video, the girl can be heard crying.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office said a deputy with direct view of the dashcam video had used FaceTime to view the handcuffed child and determined she was not a suspect. The sheriff\u2019s office said it documented differences between the girl and the wanted person, including in the camouflage patterns of their pants, the grains of their pink jackets, the length of their hair and their complexions, the agency said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis situation was cleared up quickly, largely due to the juvenile\u2019s disposition, patience, and cooperation,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "Sheriff Tobias Shelley said he had met with the girl\u2019s mother to discuss her concerns and that he understood why she was upset about not having been informed that her daughter was handcuffed. The sheriff\u2019s office said it would change its policy \u201cto notify a parent or guardian of any juvenile who is detained for criminal investigative purposes, no matter how brief the encounter is.\u201d",
      "The New York Civil Liberties Union condemned the deputies\u2019 actions, saying in a statement that it was \u201cextremely disturbed by the aggressive treatment of an 11-year-old Black child at the hands of Syracuse Sheriff\u2019s deputies, and their failure to notify the child\u2019s parents.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis mistreatment raises serious concerns about implicit racial bias, which too often leads law enforcement officers to perceive children of color as a threat. It also raises questions about appropriate training and protocols in the Sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d the civil rights organization said. \u201cThe Onondaga County Sheriff\u2019s Office must engage the community in dialogue and make further changes with community input.\u201d",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement that detainees \u201care usually handcuffed initially\u201d because they may become uncooperative, flee or fight.",
      "\u201cHandcuffing juveniles in this circumstance is lawful, within policy, and common practice in law enforcement,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The girl\u2019s mother told NBC affiliate WSTM of Syracuse that she could not comprehend what she saw when she watched the video.",
      "\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t my child, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish watching the video, because that\u2019s not how you handle children,\u201d she told the station."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:18:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The Republican-controlled Senate is aiming to pass a bill to crack down on illegal immigration with the hope of making it Donald Trump's first legislative win.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-controlled Senate is aiming to pass a bill to crack down on illegal immigration in the coming days, with the hope of sending it to incoming President Donald Trump next week as his first legislative victory.",
      "But Senate debate on the bill has dragged on this week, with two main hurdles still on the road ahead to passage of the Laken Riley Act, which would require Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain people who are charged, arrested or convicted for committing acts of \u201cburglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.\u201d",
      "The first obstacle is securing 60 votes in the Senate to break a filibuster and end the debate, which means winning at least seven Democratic votes \u2014 or more if they vote when there\u2019s an empty seat in Florida or Ohio. That could depend on whether Republicans allow more amendments, which leaders are being selective about, as they target a vote on final passage by Monday.",
      "\u201cThere are some Democrats who are trying to undermine the bill,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told NBC News. \u201cRepublicans are not going to undermine or weaken this lifesaving bill.\u201d",
      "The second obstacle is the House will have to vote on the bill again after the Senate.",
      "The Senate voted 70-25 to adopt an amendment by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to add assault of a law enforcement officer to the list of offenses by an unauthorized immigrant that triggers mandatory detention. The GOP-led House passed the initial bill 264-159 last week, with the support of 48 Democrats.",
      "Republicans also hope to vote on an amendment from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, requiring ICE officials to detain undocumented migrants who are arrested or charged with causing death or bodily harm.",
      "The new amendments would also raise the final price tag of the bill.",
      "In an ICE assessment to Congress last year, officials predicted the Laken Riley Act \u2014 named after a Georgia nursing school student who was murdered last year by an undocumented immigrant \u2014would cost $3.2 billion to enforce. But Democratic appropriators pushed back, and in conjunction with input from ICE officials, estimated a cost of $83 billion over just the first three years, according to a document obtained from a Democratic source.",
      "\u201cBeyond the exorbitant costs, [the Department of Homeland Security] would not be able to comply with the language as written. The personnel, detention space, and transportation requirements to execute the bill are not feasible to obtain in the near future,\u201d the document states.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., who introduced the Senate bill, accused Democrats of \u201cusing a projection of 800,000 criminal illegal aliens who would be affected by this bill in year one\u201d which they call an \u201cold\u201d projection based on a March 2024 briefing with ICE officials.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to give ICE the resources it needs to properly enforce federal law and protect American families, both through the appropriations and reconciliation processes,\u201d she said, referring to two potential paths to secure additional funding.",
      "In a move fueled by the rightward shift in immigration politics, many Democrats in competitive House districts voted for the legislation and some senators in swing states, like Sens. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and John Fetterman, D-Pa., have co-sponsored it.",
      "But while many Senate Democrats voted to begin debate on the bill, some have said they won\u2019t support final passage unless the Senate adopts some amendments to the bill, like Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. It's unclear whether it'll achieve 60 votes in the end.",
      "Even some supporters of the bill say it could be improved: Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., told NBC News it should be modified to avoid targeting migrants who are merely accused \u2014 rather than convicted \u2014 of crimes. She also called for a carve-out for \u201cDreamers,\u201d or undocumented people brought to the country as children.",
      "Democrats are pushing Republicans to grant votes on additional amendments, but it is far from certain that they\u2019ll get any.",
      "Pro-immigration activists have blasted the bill as a Trojan horse by conservatives to upend the system, strip away due process for migrants and empower hard-line state officials like Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to reshape federal immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to overstate the extent to which Democratic leadership is flailing right now,\u201d said Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of the progressive group Indivisible. \u201cRepublicans are going to do this over and over. They\u2019re going to package something as a messaging bill, and inside it, they\u2019re going to dismantle constitutional protections and empower extremism.

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next week will mean sweeping changes in the way the federal government handles issues from foreign policy to education \u2014 and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona is already rebutting what he\u2019s expecting to see from his successor.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next week will mean sweeping changes in the way the federal government handles issues from foreign policy to education \u2014 and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona is already rebutting what he\u2019s expecting to see from his successor.",
      "In an interview with NBC News this week, Cardona, who served in President Joe Biden\u2019s Cabinet for four years, said he is both proud of his efforts to protect the changes implemented under his watch and concerned about how the second Trump administration will handle education issues, including Trump\u2019s stated goal of eliminating the Department of Education altogether.",
      "Cardona said eliminating the department would widen disparities between students and disproportionately hurt the most vulnerable populations.",
      "\u201cThe federal Department of Education at its core is a civil rights agency that ensures that students in protected classes, in particular, get their rights, and that students are getting the support that a public education should provide,\u201d Cardona said. \u201cIt would create a wider gap between the haves and have nots.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of politicizing schools and has promised to cut funding to some schools. He has said, \u201cOn day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "Cardona said Trump\u2019s plans would \u201cdeteriorate the fabric of our country.\u201d",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, pushed back on Cardona\u2019s assertion and said the \u201cbest movements\u201d that have made the \u201cmost positive impact\u201d on the nation\u2019s education systems are happening at the local and state levels.",
      "\u201cOnly a liberal bureaucratic mindset would imagine that government would be the solution for our education system,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo I think with the president and with Linda McMahon, when she\u2019s confirmed, what you\u2019ll see is a department that recognizes the need to put more power and economic freedom into the core mission of educating our kids at the local and state level. And if you do that, if you really bring a reform mind and choice back to local communities, it will have the exact opposite of disparity. It will actually bring more equity and equal opportunity of education to communities, particularly underserved communities.\u201d",
      "The matter of the department's existence is not the only looming education fight. When asked how he has sought to protect some of the Biden administration\u2019s work at the department beyond his impending departure, Cardona said he was proud of streamlining the public service loan forgiveness program.",
      "\u201cWe went from 7,000 people in the first Trump administration that got debt relief \u2014 these are teachers and nurses and firefighters, police officers \u2014 now we have over a million,\u201d Cardona said. \u201cSo the way we changed that should continue to grow \u2014 unless, you know, the next administration seeks to destroy that relief that was passed in bipartisan fashion.\u201d",
      "But some critics of Cardona are eyeing the separate student loans deferment programs passed under Biden as places ripe for immediate change under Trump.",
      "Frederick Hess, director of education policy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said he welcomes the change in administration and wants to see \u201cstudent loans back to the deal it\u2019s supposed to be between borrowers and taxpayers.\u201d",
      "He also said he wanted to see changes to Free Application for Federal Student Aid, the form known as FAFSA, after the department endured a botched redesign of the process, disrupting decision timelines for current and prospective college students and schools across the country.",
      "Hess also criticized Cardona\u2019s leadership and said he \u201cpoliticized the department in small and unnecessary ways.\u201d It\u2019s a charge Cardona denies but one that Republicans have effectively made against Democrats at the ballot box.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a corporate turnaround. You got to, like, fix all the bad stuff before you get to do what you want to do,\u201d Hess said, adding that while he doesn\u2019t think there will be the support to eliminate the Department of Education, he would be fine with it going away.",
      "\u201cThe federal government can do education, higher ed, K-12, whether or not there\u2019s a department,\u201d Hess said. \u201cWhether or not there\u2019s a website that says you\u2019re now visiting the U.S. Department of Education is not what really matters when it comes to what Washington is doing, as far as schools or colleges. What really matters is what kinds of rules we\u2019re writing, what kinds of programs exist, how much money is being spent. The \u2018abolish the department\u2019 debate is less helpful when people kind of focus on it, rather than those more specific, more important pieces.\u201d",
      "Trump has nominated Linda McMahon, a former World Wrestling Entertainment executive who served in the first Trump administration as head of the Small Business Administration, as his pick to lead the Education Department.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that McMahon is well equipped to do it. I don\u2019t know her. We\u2019ll see, in part, through her confirmation process,\u201d Hess said. \u201cBut her background in business and the small business administration certainly suggests to me that she might have the right skills.\u201d",
      "Hess added that he hopes to see legislative changes by Congress that will do things like bolster school choice initiatives, as well as executive orders by Trump on issues like combating antisemitism and discrimination on college campuses. Still, he acknowledged that some of Cardona\u2019s biggest actions can\u2019t be undone, including the funding he has given out for state initiatives as well as millions of dollars in student loan forgiveness.",
      "Meanwhile, Derrell Bradford, president of 50CAN, a nonprofit that supports school choice policies like charter schools and vouchers, said he hopes to see the Department of Education under Trump do things like making it easier for people to access federal funds to start charter schools and supporting career and technical education programs along with college and career apprenticeships initiatives. He added that he hopes the country can come together despite the partisanship that has been infused in education debates.",
      "\u201cEducation is political and so at some level is partisan. But a family\u2019s love for their kids, and their desire to have them be the best version of themselves is apolitical,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cI would also like to see the department spend more time highlighting the things that states are doing together, regardless of who\u2019s in charge of them, as a way to show that that kind of collaboration is still possible.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Rudy Giuliani has reached a settlement agreement with the former Georgia election workers he owed almost $150 million to, according to a court filing Thursday.",
      "The tentative deal was revealed after Giuliani failed to appear for a trial in federal court in New York that would determine whether he had to surrender his Florida home and New York Yankees World Series rings to Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, the workers who have a $146 million judgment against him.",
      "In a statement, Giuliani said, \u201cI have reached a resolution of the litigation with the Plaintiffs that will result in a satisfaction of the Plaintiffs\u2019 judgment.\"",
      "\"This resolution does not involve an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any of the Parties. I am satisfied with and have no grievances relating to the result we have reached. I have been able to retain my New York coop and Florida Condominium and all of my personal belongings,\" the statement said.",
      "The statement does not reveal how \u2014 or how much of \u2014 the huge damages amount will be satisfied. Giuliani had complained throughout the case that he\u2019s been having trouble making ends meet, and had declared bankruptcy after getting hit with the verdict. A judge dismissed the bankruptcy case last year.",
      "\"No one deserves to be subjected to threats, harassment, or intimidation. This litigation has taken its toll on all parties. This whole episode was unfortunate. I and the Plaintiffs have agreed not to ever talk about each other in any defamatory manner, and I urge others to do the same,\" Giuliani said in his statement, which he posted on X.",
      "In a separate statement, Freeman and Moss said: \u201cThe past four years have been a living nightmare. We have fought to clear our names, restore our reputations, and prove that we did nothing wrong. Today is a major milestone in our journey. We have reached an agreement, and we can now move forward with our lives. We have agreed to allow Mr. Giuliani to retain his property in exchange for compensation and his promise not to ever defame us.\u201d",
      "The two sides also submitted a joint letter to the judge.",
      "\"Plaintiffs and Defendant have executed a settlement agreement that, once certain conditions are met, would fully resolve all issues currently scheduled for trial, including the claims of Intervenor Andrew H. Giuliani, and would result in the conclusion of all litigation currently pending between and among the Parties,\" the filing said.",
      "Andrew Giuliani, the former New York mayor's son, had intervened in the case, arguing his father had gifted him the championship rings back in 2018.",
      "The letter said they would report back to the judge when the deal is finalized.",
      "The trial had been scheduled to start at 9 a.m. ET, with both Giulianis scheduled to testify. Andrew Giuliani was in court for the proceedings and said afterward, \"Today is a good day.\"",
      "Joseph Cammarata, Rudy Giuliani's attorney, told reporters that both sides had been involved in settlement negotiations \"for quite some time\" but they were \"very extensive\" in the 72 hours preceding the announcement of the deal.",
      "Giuliani was found liable for defaming Freeman and Moss by repeatedly accusing them \u2014 falsely \u2014 of committing election fraud in 2020. A jury awarded them\u00a0$148 million in damages in December 2023. A judge later reduced the award to $146 million.",
      "Giuliani was appealing that verdict, but Freeman and Moss had moved to seize his assets while the case is litigated. He had already been ordered to turn over cash, his car, his multimillion-dollar New York apartment and other sports memorabilia.",
      "The original case brought by Freeman and Moss in Washington had spurred two other legal actions \u2014 the one in New York seeking to collect on the judgment and another in Washington seeking to stop Giuliani from continuing to defame them.",
      "Giuliani was found in contempt of court in both of those actions this month. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman found Giuliani in contempt for repeatedly failing to follow court orders to turn over information in the New York case, while U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found him in contempt for having again defamed Freeman and Moss on his web show.",
      "Liman had scheduled a hearing for later this month on how Giuliani should be punished, but both sides asked Thursday for that to be delayed \"to permit the Parties to fully implement the Agreement.\"",
      "Liman agreed and ordered both sides to come back before him on March 3.",
      "Howell had ordered Giuliani to file a sworn declaration by Jan. 20 acknowledging he did not present any evidence of Freeman and Moss\u2019 having committed election fraud in the defamation case, and that all the witnesses in the case testified they had not committed any fraud. She also ordered him to pay a $ 200-a-day fine if he did not do so.",
      "It was not immediately clear how Thursday's agreement affects that ruling.",
      "\"I think you\u2019re going to have to stay tuned to what happens with that,\" Cammarata said."

      "Beloved baseball broadcaster and actor Bob Uecker, who parlayed an unremarkable playing career into a decadeslong stint behind the mic and in front of the camera, died Thursday, officials said.",

      "\"Today we take on the heaviest of burdens. Today we say goodbye to our beloved friend, Bob Uecker,\" the Milwaukee Brewers, his employer since 1971, announced. \"Ueck was the light of the Brewers, the soundtrack of our summers, the laughter in our hearts, and his passing is a profound loss.\"",
      "He was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer in early 2023, his loved ones said.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" his family said in a statement.",
      "Uecker was a fixture behind the mic in Milwaukee for more than 50 years, though he'd cut back from a full-time 162-game schedule in recent years.",
      "\u201cEven with his considerable success in Hollywood, Bob remained fiercely loyal to baseball and to Milwaukee,\u201d MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cHe loved the game and used his platform to help numerous charitable causes in his hometown and beyond.",
      "Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich posted video of himself with Uecker celebrating in 2021 when Milwaukee won the National League Central.",
      "\"I remember you saying that no matter how much time you have it still never feels like enough and that seems pretty true today,\" Yelich wrote Thursday.",
      "\"You\u2019d always thank me for my friendship but the truth of it is the pleasure was all mine. I\u2019ll miss you my friend.\"",
      "In addition to his half-century in baseball press boxes, Uecker also left a mark on comedy with his memorable acting roles on the 1989 movie \"Major League\" and later the sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "From 1985 to 1990, Uecker played sportswriter George Owens in six seasons of the ABC sitcom about a suburban Pittsburgh family of five and their British butler, who tries to make sense of American absurdities.",
      "Uecker appeared in all three films in the \"Major League\" franchise, stealing scenes as Cleveland broadcaster Harry Doyle.

      "When an usher told him, \"You're in the wrong seat buddy, come on,\" Uecker famously replied, \u201cI must be in the front row\u201d \u2014 before he ended up in the far reaches of the upper deck.",

      "\"As we said good night, I heard Johnny ask Ed McMahon, 'Did this guy really play baseball?'\" he said on the \"Dan Patrick Show\" in 2018.",
      "Uecker's desire to pursue a life on screen came from playing in his era of baseball, when run-of-the-mill performers had to work 12 months a year because between-the-lines salaries didn't pay all the bills.",
      "\"You had to have it because there wasn't enough money unless you were one of the big guys,\" Uecker told Patrick.",
      "Uecker's greatest mark was in the baseball press box, where he was one of the game's most popular broadcasters.",
      "In 2003, he was presented with the Ford C. Frick Award, the sport's highest broadcast honor.",
      "In his Baseball Hall of Fame acceptance speech, which turned into a nonstop laugh track, Uecker reveled in mocking his own MLB career.",
      "In six big league seasons, Uecker batted .200 with 14 home runs in 297 games.",

      "\"I'd be sitting there and [Philadelphia Phillies manager Gene Mauch would] say, 'Grab a bat and stop this rally,'\" Uecker told a laughing audience. \"[He'd] send me up there without a bat and tell me to try for a walk.

      "One of those powerful people is mega-pop star Taylor Swift, whom Lively has counted among her best friends for years. The other is her husband, Ryan Reynolds.",
      "The lawsuit, which Baldoni filed Thursday against Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, alleges that Reynolds and Swift bolstered a version of a scene in the movie written by Lively. His lawsuit includes screenshots of text messages between Baldoni and Lively.",

      "\"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim. This is what experts call DARVO. Deny. Attack. Reverse Victim Offender,\" her team said in a statement.",

      "He says in the suit that Lively texted him asking him for the chance while noting that other directors had not allowed her to write scenes.",
      "Baldoni says in the suit that he was \"reluctant to allow\" her to rewrite it but \"felt the need\" to give her the chance and agreed to review her draft, which \"dramatically differed from what had been written originally.\"",

      "In a lengthy response, according to the suit, Lively wrote, \"we're in this together.\" She also defended her \"dragons,\" it says, appearing to refer to Reynolds and Swift, whose name is redacted in this set of screenshots included in the lawsuit.",
      "Lively said she is the luckiest person \"on the planet to have them as my 'Dance Moms' level stage moms. They are embarrassingly effusive,\" the suit says.",
      "She also called them her \"most trusted partners and the people I go to first with anything creative I touch,\" it alleges. Lively said she felt good sending Baldoni her scene only after Reynolds and Swift had approved it, according to the suit.",
      "It says Lively texted Baldoni: \"I think they wanted you and me to see how they felt about the work because they've been by my side for far too many experiences where I've been overlooked.\"",
      "She wrote that Reynolds and Swift \"have established themselves as absolute titans as writers and storytellers outside of their primary gig \u2014\u00a0just singing or just acting or just directing,\" the suit says.",
      "\"They also know I'm not always as good at making sure I'm seen and utilized for fear of threatening egos, or fear of affecting the ease of the process,\" Lively continued, it says. \"They don't give a s--- about that. And because of that, everyone listens to them with immense respect and enthusiasm. So I guess I have to stop worrying about people liking me.\"",
      "She then compared herself to Khaleesi from \"Game of Thrones,\" the suit says.",
      "\"Like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually for better,\" Lively said, it says. \"Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.\""

      "Williams responded, \u201cDo I seem that way?\u201d The rest of the show\u2019s hosts agreed she didn\u2019t.",
      "Finnie, too, spoke to her aunt\u2019s temperament. \u201cThis does not match an incapacitated person,\u201d she said. \u201cMy aunt has always been a unique personality. \u2026 That is who she is.\u201d",
      "Morrissey did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "In the Lifetime documentary, Williams often appeared to have cognitive difficulty when speaking to her loved ones. Her son, Kevin Hunter Jr., and manager Will Selby both suggested that these issues were associated with her alcohol use.",
      "Williams currently has a court-appointed legal guardian, Morrissey, who oversees her money and health to avoid the potential for her to be exploited due to her cognitive issues, People reported.",

      "Primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, impacts speech, reading, writing and the ability to understand what others are saying to you. It\u2019s a subtype of frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, which affects communication, including speech, writing and the ability to understand language.",
      "FTD is caused by shrinking in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control personality, behavior and language. Depending on which parts of the brain are affected, someone might experience personality changes, such as behaving erratically, inappropriately, or becoming distant, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "FTD is sometimes misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it typically occurs at a younger age, between 40 and 65, than other types of dementia.",
      "\u201cMost people, when they think of the word dementia, they think problems with memory and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but FTD doesn\u2019t really show up as problems with memory. ... It affects how people behave, how they interact with others and how they speak,\u201d Dr. Sami Barmada, director of Michigan Brain Bank and associate professor of neurology at University of Michigan Medicine, previously told TODAY.com about Bruce Willis, who was diagnosed with the same conditions.",

      "\u201cI continue to need personal space and peace to thrive,\u201d she concluded. \u201cPlease just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.\u201d",

      "In February 2018, the talk show host announced she\u2019d be taking a three-week break from \u201cThe Wendy Williams Show\u201d because she had been diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease. About a week before, she\u2019d canceled several shows due to experiencing flu-like symptoms. At the time, a rep for her show told TODAY.com in a statement that she\u2019d had Graves\u2019 disease for \u201cmany years.\u201d",

This overproduction of thyroid hormones, or hyperthyroidism, can lead to an increased heart rate, sweating, weight loss, anxiety, hair loss, difficulty sleeping and bulging eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Williams noted that her fans pointed out changes in her eyes when she revealed her diagnosis. \u201cGraves\u2019 disease squeezes the muscles behind the eyeballs,\u201d she explained, adding that it\u2019s caused her eyeballs to twitch.",
      "Williams returned to her show, but she had to take time off in 2019 and again in 2020 to cope with her illness.",
      "\u201cIf hyperthyroidism is untreated, it can be life-threatening,\u201d Adimoolam says. While there are treatments, such as medication, surgery and therapy, Graves\u2019 disease looks different for every person, she adds. Even with treatment, it might remain debilitating for some.",
      "Wendy Williams fainted on live TV in 2017",

      "Dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she was talking to the camera and then started to shake and struggle to speak before falling on the ground. The show cut to a commercial, and when it returned, she told viewers, \u201cThat was not a stunt. I overheated in my costume. I passed out.\u201d",
      "The next day, she explained that prior to fainting, she felt \u201chot and a little dizzy.\u201d She said the paramedics later told her she was low on electrolytes.",
      "\u201cIt was scary,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was really scary. It was so scary, all I could think of in the middle of the scare was, \u2018Don\u2019t pull the podium over on you, because that\u2019ll make it worse.\u2019\u201d",
      "Wendy Williams has struggled with alcohol and cocaine use",
      "In 2013, Williams told NPR she used to be a \u201creal fiend\u201d when it came to drugs. \u201cI was addicted to cocaine,\u201d she said. \u201cCrack cocaine \u2014 cooking it, getting it up in the Bronx. ... Thank God I never got stopped by the cops to shame my family and myself and lose my job.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Williams revealed she was living in a sober house. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve had a struggle with cocaine in my past, and I never went to a place to get the treatment,\u201d Williams said during an episode of her show.",
      "The documentary and a February 2024 People cover story also reference her alcohol use.

      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams\u2019 case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn\u2019t drain properly. Most often, it develops over a person\u2019s lifetime. It\u2019s not curable and can be painful and lead to dangerous complications.",
      "Wendy Williams has been living with lymphedema, a chronic condition that can be highly uncomfortable, for several years.",

Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",

      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",

    "summary": "Bob Uecker, who died Jan. 16, was not only a baseball player, but a comedic actor in roles including the movie \"Major League.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker had the kind of career stat line that would be sad if it wasn\u2019t so funny. But funny is what would ultimately cement his legacy.",
      "Uecker, who died Jan. 16 at the age of 90, was a career .200 hitter across six seasons in Major League Baseball. He ultimately embraced his own ineptitude, often mocking himself for his lack of ability on the diamond.",
      "Uecker took his schtick and ran with it, all the way to Hollywood. Nicknamed \u201cMr. Baseball,\u201d he was a frequent, gut-busting guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d for years after he retired. He appeared in several well-known Miller Lite commercials, in which he poked fun at himself when he declared, \u201cI must be in the front row\u201d after an usher at a game informs him that he\u2019s in the wrong seats. He parlayed those efforts into a starring role on the small screen, playing George Owens on the ABC sitcom \u201cMr. Belvedere,\u201d which ran for six seasons from 1985 until 1990.",
      "But all of that may have just been a prologue for what seems like a casting job that was as natural as a tailor-made 4-6-3 double play. In the hit 1989 movie \u201cMajor League,\u201d Uecker played Cleveland play-by-play announcer Harry Doyle, whose wit would often serve as cover for how awful the team was, only for him to get caught up in the fervor when the team begins winning.",
      "(There's profanity in the clip below.)",
      "\u201cJuuuust a bit outside,\u201d he casually says early in the movie, stretching out the word \u201cjust\u201d when Charlie Sheen\u2019s Rick \u201cWild Thing\u201d Vaughn throws a pitch more than a few feet off home plate during the team\u2019s first game. It's one of the movie's best and most memorable lines.",
      "Doyle is also crestfallen when he tries to amplify the sound of the crowd on Opening Day and gets feisty when he curses on air.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one\u2019s listening anyway,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s funny, but it may have also been pioneering.",
      "\u201cUecker\u2019s irreverence enlivened a character \u2014 the play-by-play announcer \u2014 that had long been taken for granted in baseball films,\u201d Noah Gittell wrote in the 2024 book \u201cBaseball: The Movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cTypically, their role was to set the scene for the film\u2019s climactic game with flowery prose or ... act as foil to the players or manager. (Director and writer David S.) Ward and Uecker collaborated on a true innovation of the genre by turning this archetype into a comic Greek chorus punctuating the clownish action on the field with perfectly delivered zingers. It was a breath of fresh air for the baseball film, which had perhaps become overly solemn in the \u201880s with \u2018The Natural,\u2019 \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 and \u2018Eight Men Out.\u2019\u201d",
      "Uecker, who spent 54 seasons as the radio play-by-play man for the Milwaukee Brewers, reprised the role in \u201cMajor League II.\u201d He wasn\u2019t just a perfect fit as Harry Doyle, though. He also provided a template for those who came after him.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a play-by-play announcer in the game who hasn\u2019t once paid homage to the film by impersonating Uecker\u2019s delivery of that line,\u201d Gittell added about how Uecker said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t only announcers, either. If you ever played Wiffle ball in your backyard, turned on a baseball game or, heck, even tried archery and missed a target by 10 feet, you\u2019ve probably said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",
      "Uecker had an uncanny talent for putting a smile on people\u2019s faces, whether in a studio audience or in a movie theater.",
      "\u201cThe most hilarious guy I\u2019ve ever met, off-camera and on,\u201d \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d co-star Rob Stone once said about Uecker.",
      "Baseball and movies are known for their characters \u2014 movies for the characters in them, baseball for characters who add personality to the game. Uecker was a character, alright, and his portrayal of a key supporting character echoes today, as fans will miss him more than \u201cjuuuust a bit.\u201d"

      "Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com that he was \u201cjust blown away\u201d when he heard his life story was being made into a movie, yet had some hesitations.",
      "\u201cI was really excited initially, but the more I thought about it the more nervous I got. It kind of turned into me being terrified about the whole process just because I realized, at that moment, that not only my story, but my family story, would be told to the world,\u201d Anthony Robles explains. \u201cAnd that included the painful moments, the things that we weren\u2019t comfortable sharing.\u201d",
      "After he and his mother agreed to move forward with the project, they decided that their ultimate goal was to motivate people and \u201cbe as true as possible with our entire story,\u201d he says.",

      "The oldest of five siblings, \u201cUnstoppable\u201d depicts Anthony's early beginnings living with his mother Judy and his brothers and sisters. It also shows his mom's tumultuous relationship with his stepfather Rick, portrayed by Cannavale, and how Anthony overcame a multitude of challenges.",
      "In the film, there's a scene where Rick reminds a young Anthony that he isn't his real father. There's also an argument between Rick and Judy regarding financial issues and lies. At one point, Anthony and Rick get into a physical altercation after the wrestler discovers that Rick lost his job and is trying to get back with his mom.",
      "\u201cThere are moments where I was actually tearing up, just reading it, where I was feeling the anger all over again, the pain all over again,\u201d Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut talking to my mom about it, and talking to my siblings, because they went through the same experiences with us, we were all on the same page. We realized that we had to share that part of our story.\u201d",
      "In a Jan. 14 Q&A for the film in New York, attended by TODAY.com, Judy Robles said that in order to tell their story, she had to share \u201cthe things that I was feeling, the things that I was dealing with, and the things that I was doing wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo being vulnerable was very, very hard, but I think that when this team came alongside and they made us feel safe,\u201d she said.",
      "How Anthony Robles and J.Lo helped to ensure 'Unstoppable' was authentic",
      "Anthony Robles was included in the script process to make sure his story was authentic. As with any biopic, there were some dramatizations for the film, including dialogue.",
      "However, Anthony Robles says \u201cfor the most part, they did a great job of sticking with the authentic story and what happened.\u201d There were little tidbits here and there, he says, they changed for timing purposes, \u201cwhere they had to bunch certain things together.\u201d",
      "Among his \u201cbiggest concerns\u201d for the film was how his mom was going to be portrayed, \u201cbecause she is the one that I look up to as my hero. The one that got me through those tough times, that helped me to find that little ounce of hope to keep going.\u201d He tells TODAY.com his goal was to show people where her strength came from.",
      "One fun fact about the film is that Judy Robles actually gave Lopez her real clothes to wear in the film. Among the items that Lopez wears that were Judy Robles\u2019 include \u201cwrestler mom\u201d shirts, hoodies and a pink beanie.",
      "Sharing how \u201cJennifer was just so committed to portray my mom in this authentic light, down to the clothes,\u201d Anthony Robles even mistook Lopez for his mom.",
      "\u201cOne day I was on set and we\u2019re getting ready to start filming. I see someone walk by, and I thought it was my mom because I saw the beanie and I recognized the shirt,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was walking away from me, and it was Jennifer. She turned around, (and I was like), whoa, this is crazy.\u201d",
      "At the end of the film it notes that Judy Robles graduated from Arizona State University in 2014 and earned her doctorate in 2022. She's currently serving as the\u00a0assistant dean\u00a0of students at ASU.",
      "How Jharrel Jerome transformed into Anthony Robles in 'Unstoppable'",
      "Anthony Robles was \u201cextremely impressed\u201d with Jerome\u2019s dedication to the role and training regime. The actor had to learn how to be a wrestler and how to walk and run on crutches.",
      "\u201cIt was very physically demanding for him,\u201d Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com, adding that his style of wrestling is \u201cvery unique.\u201d",
      "Jerome echoed Anthony Robles\u2019 comments in an interview with Variety, telling the magazine the athlete coached him 14 hours a day.",
      "\u201cRepeating the same moves again and again. He taught me to use my fists and my arms and to stretch and pull with all these different parts of my body,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIt was the most physically challenging thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d",
      "It was also challenging for Anthony Robles, who said had to get back on the mat for some scenes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a high school wrestling coach. I\u2019m showing technique, but to get back into the physicality of it, I was training like I was back in my wrestling days,\u201d Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com.",
      "His training included being on the mat for hours a day, cardio that included swimming, spin and more.",
      "Anthony Robles says giving 100 percent during the scenes felt like he was wrestling a full match again.",
      "\u201cI was definitely feeling it. My body was tired, my lungs were given out,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was competing all over again.\u201d",
      "Additionally, his former assistant wrestling coach from Arizona State, Brian Stith, was brought in to help choreograph the wrestling matches. \u201cHe knew exactly what made me me on the wrestling mat,\u201d he says.",
      "Anthony Robles' real-life bond with his coaches",
      "Michael Pe\u00f1a co-stars as coach Bobby Williams, Anthony\u2019s high school coach and one of his biggest champions. To this day, he remains in contact with them and tells TODAY.com that they \u201ctext regularly.\u201d",
      "\u201cBobby Williams, he\u2019s always been like a father figure to me,\" he says, crediting him for helping him find his abilities. \"Walking into the wrestling room for the first time, he treated me like I was a national champion already.\u201d",
      "He adds that Williams also echoed his mom\u2019s advice to him, saying, \u201cMy mom would always tell me, \u2018Focus on what you\u2019re capable of, focus on what you can do, not what you can\u2019t.\u2019 And in the wrestling room, my coach used to tell me, \u2018We\u2019re going to focus on your strengths and camouflage your weaknesses. We\u2019re going to build a style that works for you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Just like in \u201cUnstoppable,\u201d he would get advice from Williams while wrestling in college. They would later go on to coach together for three years.",
      "Don Cheadle took on the role of coach Shawn Charles, Anthony\u2019s ASU wrestling coach who, at first, appears to question Anthony\u2019s ability. He\u2019s quickly proven wrong when Anthony goes above and beyond during try-outs and training.",
      "As for Charles, Anthony Robles says his coach would always back him up when he was struggling. He credits him for taking him to a \u201cwhole new level.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe forced me outside of my comfort zone on a regular basis,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust challenged me to think at a different level and improve myself.\u201d",
      "He says that having them both at the national tournament his senior year, seeing him win and celebrating together \u201cwas something very special, because I could not have gotten there without either one of them.\u201d",
      "Where is Anthony Robles now?",
      "Anthony Robles would go on to become the first athlete signed by Nike after retiring from a sport. At the end of the film, there is a message from former CEO of Nike, Inc. Phil Knight that reads, \u201cAfter what he accomplished, Anthony Robles will be a Nike athlete for life.\u201d",
      "In 2013, former President Barack Obama appointed him to President\u2019s council on fitness, sports and nutrition, and in 2022 he took over as wrestling coach at Mesa High in Arizona.",
      "Now a motivational speaker and author, Anthony Robles is a husband and father. He and wife, Laura Robles, have been married for three years. They are parents to a 2-year-old boy named Abel.",
      "He also continues to be a wrestling coach, helping other students get motivated and inspired.",
      "\u201cIf I can help even one of them, that\u2019s my way of giving back and saying thank you to the people who helped me to get here today,\u201d he says."

Give us a peace about this decision to end our relationship that transcends worldly understanding,\" he captioned the post. \"Shower our friends and family with kindness and love to comfort us. And remind us that our Joy comes from you, Lord \ud83d\udc94.\"",
      "The entrepreneur tagged his former girlfriend in the post but blocked comments. Kirkconnell has not acknowledged the breakup on her own Instagram page yet, and TODAY.com has reached out to her for comment.",
      "Kirkconnell last posted about her relationship with James on Dec. 5 when she shared a video montage on his birthday, calling him \"my best friend, my teammate, my sous chef, the man that has my whole heart.\"",
      "\"Thank you for your never ending love and support and smooches and snuggles. to many more adventures, happy birthday my pumpkin \u2661,\" she captioned the post.",
      "The former couple met during Season 25 of \u201cThe Bachelor,\" which featured James as the first Black male lead in the series' history. In the season finale, James selected Kirkconnell but did not propose, explaining that he wanted to \"make sure my love is enough for you\" before committing to spending the rest of their lives together.",
      "During the \"After the Final Rose\" special, the couple revealed that they were no longer together. James explained that he broke up with Kirkconnell after old photos resurfaced of her attending an antebellum-themed party in 2018. There were also claims that she had liked photos featuring Confederate flags on social media.",
      "Despite Kirkconnell's public apology, James did not move forward with their relationship at the time.",
      "He explained his decision while speaking with Kirkconnell during the special, saying, \"When I questioned our relationship, it was in the context of you not fully understanding my Blackness and what it means to be a Black man in America, and what it would mean for our kids when I saw those things that were floating around the Internet.\u201d",
      "James added that he ended their relationship so Kirkconnell could work on herself. Meanwhile, she said she felt blindsided.",
      "\u201cI thought about how strong I thought our relationship was, so for him to end things, he must have been very, very hurt by everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard because I lost the love of my life and in the process of doing that, I hurt him. \u2026 I love him so much and I always will.\u201d",
      "The couple later reunited and went on to date for several years.",
      "In February 2024, James talked to People about getting engaged to Kirkconnell in the future.",
      "\"We wouldn\u2019t be together if that wasn\u2019t the same goal,\u201d he shared at the time. \u201cI\u2019m definitely excited for what the future looks like with us.\u201d",
      "He added that the proposal is \"going to be something special because Rachael\u2019s very special.\""

    "story": [
      "As a girl, Aaliyah dreamed of musical stardom \u2014 and used her Barbie dolls to act them out.",
      "\u201cThe dolls would be singing and they\u2019d be performing. Sometimes I\u2019d try to get in on it,\u201d Rashad Haughton, the late singer\u2019s brother and a writer and director, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Aaliyah's childhood fantasies turned into reality as she grew up and became one of the most celebrated R&B artists of the \u201890. Sadly, the singer, whose full name was Aaliyah Haughton, passed away at the age of 22 in 2001 following a plane crash.",
      "Nearly 24 years after Aaliyah\u2019s death, the singer is being honored with a Barbie doll in her likeness.",
      "Part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, the doll is being released on the singer\u2019s birthday, Jan. 16. and will be available to purchase on the Mattel Shop for a suggested retail price of $55. (As of Jan. 16 at 9:34 a.m., the doll is sold out).",
      "Haughton worked closely with Mattel to design a doll that would resemble his sister and capture her style. The end result? A striking doll that rocks a miniature replica of the outfit Aaliyah wore in the music video for her hit song \u201cOne in a Million.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was the second album and \u2018One in a Million\u2019 was such a key song in transitioning her sound to maturity, empowerment, confidence at that point in her career,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "Haughton and Mattel worked together to design the doll\u2019s outfit, which consists of a faux leather black top and matching pants with lace-up details, a zippered vest with detached sleeves and cool sunglasses. The Mattel team also enlisted the insight of Aaliyah\u2019s stylist Derek Lee.",
      "Haughton was \u201cblown away\u201d when he saw the final product and thinks his sister would approve of the edgy ensemble since her favorite color was \u201call black.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still tight fitting, it\u2019s still a little bit sexy. But it\u2019s pants so it brings that power and that confidence and expression. It really just checked all the boxes of what my sister represents and also what Barbie represents, which is empowerment and expression,\u201d he explains.",
      "Best known for the musical style she called \u201cstreet but sweet\u201d and hits like \u201cTry Again,\u201d Aaliyah earned a host of awards throughout her career, including three American Music Awards for favorite soul/R&B female artist and two MTV Video Music Awards. She also collaborated with top musicians, including Missy Elliot and Timbaland.",
      "Haughton regularly worked as a creative consultant for the singer. Following an Aaliyah makeup collection with M.A.C. in 2018, the singer\u2019s Barbie doll is the latest brand collaboration Haughton has spearheaded to ensure that his sister\u2019s legacy lives on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like that job that I had with her is still continuing. And obviously it\u2019s emotional at times, but it\u2019s also wonderful because there\u2019s a lot of meaning in that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings back memories and it continues on dreams that we had when she was here. In a lot of ways, it makes me feel like things are continuing on as they should, and those dreams are still valuable and they\u2019re still real.\u201d",
      "Haughton calls the collaboration with Mattel \u201ca dream come true\u201d for himself and Aaliyah.",
      "\u201cIt was something that I always wanted because I know it was something that was my sister\u2019s dream,\u201d he says.",
      "With her new doll, Aaliyah joins other legendary musicians who have been part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, including Gloria Estevan, David Bowie, Elvis Presley, Elton John and Stevie Nicks.",
      "\u201cTo have my sister part of that list, it really is a testament to her legacy, and I\u2019m elated to have this doll come out. It\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "When asked how he wants people to remember Aaliyah, Haughton shares a quote his sister once gave during an appearance on MTV.",
      "\u201cWhat she said was, \u2018I want people to remember me as a true entertainer\u2019 because she really, truly loved what she did every single day. As hard as the work was and as challenging it was, I think it\u2019s not work when you love what you do,\u201d he says.",
      "Noting that Aaliyah was always \u201cappreciative\u201d of her success, Haughton recalls how those dreams started in her childhood bedroom while playing with her Barbie dolls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s (about) imagination and taking that imagination and dreaming about what you want to be, then taking those steps from childhood to the future and making it real. My sister did that. Every little girl can do that too. That\u2019s the message that I want people to take from this collaboration.\""

    "summary": "Why the Village People are performing at Donald Trump's inauguration despite their \"preferred candidate\" losing.",
    "story": [
      "Victor Willis, the lead singer of the Village People, is explaining why the long-running disco band has decide to take part in Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration.",
      "Willis shared a statement on Jan. 13 announcing the the band's members had agreed to join other artists, including Carrie Underwood, Jason Aldean, Billy Ray Cyrus and Kid Rock, to perform at multiple inaugural activities, including at least one event with the president-elect himself.",
      "\u201cWe know this wont (sic) make some of you happy to hear however we believe that music is to be performed without regard to politics,\u201d Willis wrote on Facebook. \u201cOur song Y.M.C.A. is a global anthem that hopefully helps bring the country together after a tumultuous and divided campaign where our preferred candidate lost.\u201d",
      "Willis added, \"Therefore, we believe it\u2019s now time to bring the country together with music which is why VILLAGE PEOPLE will be performing at various events as part of the 2025 Inauguration of Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Trump has played the band's 1978 disco anthem \"Y.M.C.A.\" during campaign rallies, even dancing along with attendees on the ground who spell out the song title's letters with their arms.",
      "Willis co-wrote \"Y.M.C.A.\" with late French music producer Jacques Morali, who was instrumental in creating the Village People. Morali, who was gay, died of complications from AIDS in 1991.",
      "\"Y.M.C.A.\" and other Village People hits, including \"Macho Man\" and \"In The Navy,\" were early on embraced as an anthem by the LGTBQ+ community, a point that came up in some of the shocked comments left alongside Willis' announcement.",
      "\"You would think that as a band founded and focused around queer culture, you\u2019d have a little more respect for queer people. Not to mention a backbone, for yourself,\" wrote one angry fan.",
      "Meanwhile, other fans applauded the band for agreeing to perform with unity in mind.",
      "\"Congratulations! A well deserved honor. The music has been claimed by many. So let\u2019s enjoy it together,\" someone wrote.",
      "Last month, Willis defended Trump\u2019s use of \"Y.M.C.A.\" at campaign rallies, saying in a Dec. 2 Facebook statement that the song was never intended to be a \u201cgay anthem.\u201d",
      "\"There\u2019s been a lot of talk, especially of late, that Y.M.C.A. is somehow a gay anthem. As I\u2019ve said numerous times in the past, that is a false assumption based on the fact that my writing partner was gay, and some (not all) of Village People were gay, and that the first Village People album was totally about gay life,\" wrote Willis.",
      "Willis explained that the lyrics he contributed to \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d were informed by his observations at YMCA branches in \"urban areas of San Francisco,\" where young men participated in \"swimming, basketball, track, and cheap food and cheap rooms.\"",
      "\"And when I say, 'hang out with all the boys' that is simply 1970s black slang for black guys hanging-out together for sports, gambling or whatever.  There\u2019s nothing gay about that,\" he wrote, noting that had instructed his wife to \u201cstart suing\u201d news organizations who refer to the song as a \u201cgay anthem.\"",
      "Willis added that \"Y.M.C.A.\" had \"benefited greatly\" from Trump's use at his rallies, noting that the song finally reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard dance/electronic chart and was now generating \"millions\" of dollars in sales.",
      "\"The true anthem is Y.M.C.A.\u2019s appeal to people of all strips (sic) including President Elect Trump,\" he concluded."

      "For some parents, talking about their child's drug addiction on national TV might seem like a regrettable decision, but Mary Cosby, star of \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,\" believes it's \"the best thing\" her family has done.",
      "\"It's a fine line between putting your kids out there and then protecting them,\" she tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview. \"It was just something that I questioned all the way up until it aired.\"",
      "In the stunningly emotional scene in a November episode of the reality TV show, Cosby sat down with her only child, Robert Jr., 22, to address why he was pulling away from her.",
      "The ensuing conversation showed the mother telling her son, \"You've got to be real, you've got to talk to me.\" He responded that he took Xanax the night before to help him fall asleep and Adderall to \"balance out the Xanax.\" He went on to disclose that he had been using drugs recreationally since he turned 16, including cocaine, acid and molly.",
      "\"I won't judge you,\" a devastated Cosby answered. \"I can try to help you, but you have to help yourself, because I'm not going to support it. I'm not. You know I'm not.\"",

      "One social media user wrote, \u201cShe was so gentle in the way she talked with him \ud83d\ude2d.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was waiting to be asked\u2026I was blown away by his genuine honesty. I really hope this helps other kids feel safe to open up, be honest & get the help,\u201d commented another.",

      "Cosby tells TODAY.com that she's a \"helicopter mom\" who wants to \"protect my son at all costs,\" so it was a challenging decision to be so public about the conversation. But the response has both motivated Robert Jr. to continue his recovery and made her feel confident the scene had a powerful impact.",
      "Before the scene aired, Cosby says she was contacted by tabloids threatening to publish that Robert Jr. was in rehab. \"I was like, well, I'm just going to let this air, and then they can all just be quiet,\" she says. \"It really worked.\"",
      "Cosby says there wasn't much preparation that went into the conversation. She simply told her son, \"I'm going to sit down, and it probably will be in front of the cameras, so I'm going to need you to be honest.\"",
      "Like viewers, she learned of the extent of his drug use in that moment. \"I just didn't see all that coming,\" she recalls. \"I didn't know he was going to say all that. I was in the moment ... and it shocked me, and it hurt me. It just made me feel like, 'Oh my god. How did I miss the cues?'\"",
      "\"It wasn't planned,\" she continues. \"What came out of him was real, and what came out of me was real. And I think that's why it went across so good, because we weren't doing it for any sole reason. We were doing it because that's our relationship.\""

    "summary": "YouTubers Myka Stauffer and her husband James Stauffer gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son in 2020. A new documentary explores the controversy.",
    "story": [
      "YouTubers Myka Stauffer\u00a0and James Stauffer ignited a firestorm of controversy when they gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son with special needs in 2020. Now a new HBO documentary series, \"An Update on our Family,\" revisits the Stauffers' story.",
      "The limited three-part series, which will premiere on HBO on Wednesday, Jan. 15, uses the Stauffer controversy to explore wider issues about what happens when parents decide to make their private family lives public.",
      "But why are the Stauffers' decisions so controversial? Take a look at how the family rose to social media stardom ... and then enraged their followers.",
      "Who is Myka Stauffer and her husband James?",
      "Myka Stauffer had a parenting and lifestyle YouTube channel with more than 700,000 subscribers.\u00a0Together with her husband, she and her four biological children \u2014 Nakova, Jaka, Radley and Onyx \u2014 had a family YouTube channel, The Stauffer Life, with more than 300,000 followers.",
      "Neither channel is publicly accessible on YouTube at the time of this story's publication.",
      "The Ohio-based vlogger parents\u00a0began inviting viewers into their international adoption journey in 2016, via social media. Myka Stauffer produced 27 videos with the boy they named Huxley, sharing everything from fundraising to grappling with the ever-changing rules surrounding international adoption to learning about their potential child\u2019s special needs.",
      "Why did Myka and James Stauffer adopt a child?",
      "In an article for Parade\u00a0in September 2019, Myka wrote, \"My husband was resistant (to adoption) at first, but after letting him reflect on the idea for several months, we both agreed to start researching and see what surfaced.\"",
      "The couple felt compelled to pursue an international adoption, \"and we kept being lead to China,\" Myka Stauffer wrote. Because Chinese adoption laws would only allow U.S. couples to adopt children with special needs, the couple had to decide if they were prepared to take on additional challenges.",
      "And then, Myka Stauffer wrote, she \u201csaw a little face that I couldn\u2019t walk away from.\u201d This little boy had a brain tumor; Myka Stauffer said that since she was an oncology nurse, \u201ctumors didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d",
      "She wrote, \u201cUltimately, his sad little face won our hearts over and we just knew that he was our little guy.\u201d",
      "Who is Huxley, the boy the Stauffers adopted?",
      "The boy was 2.5 years old when the whole Stauffer family flew to China to meet him and bring him to their home in America. They renamed him Huxley.",
      "Over the years, the Stauffers updated their followers on their experience adopting a child with special needs, sometimes on posts that featured advertising from major companies.",
      "Not all videos about Huxley were monetized, but many of the videos about adoption were some of the most watched on the channel, raising the Stauffers\u2019 profile and clout online. In the last two years, the video on their channel with the most views, 5.5 million, was\u00a0\u201cHuxley\u2019s EMOTIONAL Adoption VIDEO!! GOTCHA DAY China Adoption.\u201d",
      "Why did the the Stauffers find a new home for their adopted son?",
      "At the age of 4, Huxley was just starting to form words verbally and had learned a few words in sign language.",
      "Myka Stauffer said, in her Parade essay and in now-deleted videos, the family learned eventually that Huxley did not, in fact, have a brain tumor. Instead, they shared, he had a number of different medical issues: he suffered a stroke in utero, and had autism and sensory processing disorder.",
      "Eagle-eyed followers began to notice that Huxley was missing from photos and other posts on the family\u2019s social media and YouTube channel. In May 2020, the Stauffers posted a video that was viewed by TODAY.com and has since been deleted, explaining what was happening with their adopted son.",
      "\u201cOnce Huxley came home, there was a lot more special needs that we weren\u2019t aware of, and that we were not told,\u201d James Stauffer said in the video, titled \u201can update on our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals, a lot of their feedback, and things that have been upsetting,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to be in this position. And we\u2019ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of our body that doesn\u2019t love Huxley with all of our being,\u201d Myka Stauffer added. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a minute that I didn\u2019t try our hardest and I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and that (with) his medical needs, he needed more.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%,\u201d Myka Stauffer said, adding that Huxley was living with a \u201cnew mommy\u201d in a \u201cforever home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last couple months have been like the hardest thing I could have ever imagined to going to choosing to do ... after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is thriving, he is happy, he is doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.\u201d",
      "Why are people upset by the Stauffers' decision?",
      "An online uproar followed the Stauffers' announcement.",
      "Almost 50,000 people (as of publication of this article) have signed a\u00a0Change.org petition\u00a0demanding that the Stauffers remove all monetized content featuring Huxley from YouTube. And in a now-completed case, local authorities investigated the \u201cwell-being\u201d of Huxley Stauffer in response to compaints. No charges were filed.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to the Stauffers' attorney and did not get a response. In 2020, in a statement to People magazine, Myka and James Stauffer\u2019s lawyers, Thomas Taneff and Taylor Sayers, said:",
      "\u201cWe are privy to this case and given the facts at hand, we feel this was the best decision for Huxley ... In coming to know our clients we know they are a loving family and are very caring parents that would do anything for their children.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince his adoption, they consulted with multiple professionals in the healthcare and educational arenas in order to provide Huxley with the best possible treatment and care,\u201d Taneff and Sayers continued. \u201cOver time, the team of medical professionals advised our clients it might be best for Huxley to be placed with another family.\u201d",
      "In the adoption world, failed adoptions are called \u201cdisruptions.\u201d While a disruption may seem stone-hearted from the outside, according to experts TODAY.com spoke with, these  anguished acts are complex and soul-crushing for all concerned.",
      "Myka Stauffer responded to some of the backlash in an Instagram post on June 24, 2020. That screenshot remains the most recent post on her page.",
      "\"I am sorry for the confusion and pain I have caused, and I am sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning,\" she wrote, adding, \"I was naive, foolish and arrogant.\"",
      "She also debunked a few rumors, writing that the Stauffers \"did not adopt a child to gain wealth.\"",
      "The new, three-episode documentary airing this week called \"An Update On Our Family\" looks at the broader world of family vlogging through the lens of the Stauffer family's story."

      "Rita Lifshitz's 84-year-old father-in-law, Oded Lifshitz, may also be among those freed \u2014 children and the elderly are likely to make up a significant proportion of those initially freed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of emotional feelings around this,\u201d Rita Lifshitz, 59, said in a WhatsApp voice message late Thursday. \u201cSo many things can happen until the last hostages will be released,\u201d she added.",
      "Oded, a human rights and peace activist, was taken from kibbutz Niz Or with his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, who was freed in October 2023, after 17 days in Hamas captivity.",
      "\u201cWe do not know if we will come back alive or in a box,\u201d Rita Lifshitz  said, adding that she hoped the deal would be agreed to in Israel and that the relatives of the freed captives could share in the happiness.",
      "For some families, though, the deal is too little too late.",
      "Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was killed in Gaza, said Thursday that he had mixed feelings about the deal and that he was \u201csad for the fact Carmel could have been here and she\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "Gat, a 40-year-old occupational therapist from Tel Aviv, was kidnapped from her parents\u2019 home in kibbutz Be\u2019eri. Her body was recovered from Gaza by the Israeli military in August.",
      "Dickmann also questioned why a deal similar to the one currently on the table wasn't approved in May.",
      "Gat \u201cwas supposed to be part of [that] deal. And they didn\u2019t sign it in time, so she\u2019s not because she was murdered in captivity,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut on the other hand,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just here with my fellow family members of hostages and we\u2019re celebrating \u2014 we are because this news is so good.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A ceasefire deal was reached Wednesday to end\u00a015 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, according to President Joe Biden, Qatar's prime minister and Hamas officials.",
      "The\u00a0hard-won agreement will also free dozens of hostages held in Gaza, as well as Palestinians in Israeli jails, bringing the first real break in violence since a weeklong truce expired Dec. 1, 2023.",
      "The deal will take effect Sunday, according to Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country hosted weeks of intense negotiations.",
      "Under the phased agreement, Israeli forces would withdraw to the Gaza border, allowing displaced Palestinians to return to their homes and for the transfer of hostages and prisoners. Large amounts of humanitarian aid would be shipped to the enclave and hospitals and health care centers would be rebuilt, he said.",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, will release 33 hostages in exchange for 100 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences, according to a portion of the deal shared by Hamas. Israel will also release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were not involved in the Oct. 7 attacks, the text says, and an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners will also be released abroad or in Gaza.",
      "In a statement, Biden hailed \u201cmany months of intensive diplomacy\u201d by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. \u201cMy diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,\u201d the outgoing president said in part.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "In subsequent on-camera remarks, Biden said he was \u201cdeeply satisfied this day has finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza, who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\u201d",
      "The news comes amid a brutal winter for civilians in Gaza, as well as dramatic developments across the Middle East that have dealt setbacks to Iran, an Israeli foe.",
      "\u201cWe are very happy to reach a deal today to stop the aggression against our people, but unfortunately we were unable to reach the same deal last May,\u201d Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, told NBC News.",
      "In a statement, Netanyahu's office touted what it characterized as a compromise on Hamas' part.",
      "\"In light of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s firm stance, Hamas has backed down on its demand at the last minute to change the deployment of forces on\" the Philadelphi Corridor, the Israeli name for the narrow strip of land between Gaza and Egypt.",
      "\"However, there are still several unresolved clauses in the outline, and we hope that the details will be finalized tonight,\" the prime minister's office added.",
      "Gil Dickmann, the cousin of deceased hostage Carmel Gat, said it was \"very exciting\" to see that finally hostages are going to come home.",
      "\"It\u2019s also really sad to know that Carmel could have and should have been among them, but a deal didn\u2019t come in time and she was murdered in captivity,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, a diplomatic source in Washington told NBC News that Netanyahu was preparing to meet with his security Cabinet, where approval of the deal was expected quickly.\u00a0He would then take the pact to the full Cabinet, which is also expected to approve.",
      "Israel\u2019s Supreme Court would have 24 hours to permit an appeal, so the earliest a ceasefire could go into effect would be Friday, the source said.\u00a0The first group of hostages would come out Sunday, the person added.",
      "Israel launched its military campaign in the Palestinian enclave after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Just more than 100 were released in late November 2023 during a pause in hostilities, in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The war has shattered Gaza\u2019s infrastructure and displaced most of its population. Health officials in the enclave say more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most of them civilians.",
      "The chances for a ceasefire seemed vanishingly small after many false dawns in recent months.",
      "The Biden administration had called for a final effort before the president leaves office, and many in the region and in Washington viewed Trump's inauguration Monday as an unofficial deadline."

      "At a news conference this month, President-elect Donald Trump bragged, \u201cWe defeated ISIS.\u201d",
      "It has been a point of pride for him, and it is true. In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "The situation means that, once he is in office,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0most likely\u00a0have to make some hard choices \u2014\u00a0insist on withdrawing all or some of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, in line with his previous positions,\u00a0or leave them in place to prevent an ISIS resurgence and a tarnishing of what he sees as his accomplishment in his first term. U.S. withdrawal\u00a0could easily re-create Syria as a base of operations for terrorist attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Israel, the United States and Europe.",
      "The United States has been relying on fighters from the\u00a0Syrian Defense Force (SDF),\u00a0an alliance led by Kurds\u00a0in northeast Syria,\u00a0to guard thousands of\u00a0captured\u00a0ISIS\u00a0fighters and their families\u00a0there. At the height of the war\u00a0against ISIS, Gen. Joseph Votel, a former commander of U.S. Central Command,\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0that the SDF\u2019s fighters were among the best he has ever led.",
      "But the SDF\u2019s commander in chief, Gen. Mazloum\u00a0Abdi,\u00a0told The Guardian this\u00a0month\u00a0that ISIS is growing in strength after it seized weapons from the collapsed\u00a0Syrian\u00a0regime. He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",
      "Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said\u00a0Monday in an interview with NBC News that the U.S. role in helping guide and shape what is happening in Syria is \u201cessential.\u201d",
      "Blinken described the situation on the ground as \u201cincredibly fragile,\u201d warning that \u201cwhat happens inside of Syria doesn\u2019t stay inside of Syria,\u201d with the potential for terrorism that goes well beyond its borders.",
      "The United States has a stake in the \u201cextraordinary opportunity that is now before the Syrian people to actually control their own lives and their own destinies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThat means, I believe, keeping some presence, but it also means being very engaged in all of the efforts to help support a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led transition to get the country to a better place.\u201d",
      "Theodore\u00a0Kattouf,\u00a0a career diplomat who was the U.S. ambassador to Syria under President George W. Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds. Trump added, \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u00a0is his friend of mine, he\u2019s a guy I like, respect. I think he respects me also.\u201d",
      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",
      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

      "BEIJING \u2014 As he prepares to leave Beijing, the U.S. envoy to China feels relations between the two rival powers are the most stable they\u2019ve been in recent years. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will stay that way.",
      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which is uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "Trump also said he and Xi had been speaking through representatives. The Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry did not confirm any exchanges through Trump\u2019s and Xi\u2019s aides but said China and the United States had been in contact in various ways.",
      "Trump has named a number of China hard-liners among his Cabinet picks, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., his nominee for secretary of state, who is under Chinese government sanctions over his criticism of the crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first term, Beijing and Washington imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on each other in a \u201ctrade war\u201d that may worsen in his new administration, economic experts have said.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to impose tariffs of 60% or more on all Chinese goods imports, and after his election he said he would slap an additional 10% tariff on China unless it stops the international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid fentanyl.",
      "Trump has also expressed opposition to a looming ban on TikTok after earlier having supported a law requiring its Chinese parent company to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is among the tech leaders expected to attend the inauguration Monday, a day after the ban is set to take effect."

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Ukraine\u2019s capital on Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee the country\u2019s security for a century, days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president.",
      "The British government said Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a \u201c100-Year Partnership\u201d treaty in Kyiv covering areas including defense, science, energy and trade.",
      "Starmer\u2019s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July. He visited the country in 2023 when he was opposition leader, and has twice held talks with Zelenskyy in London since becoming prime minister.\u00a0The war\u00a0will be three years old next month.",
      "The Italian defense chief was also in Kyiv on Thursday, two days after Germany\u2019s defense minister visited and three days after Zelenskyy\u00a0talked by phone\u00a0with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "The flurry of diplomatic activity came in the run-up to Trump\u2019s inauguration next Monday, which is expected to bring a departure from the outgoing U.S. administration\u2019s pledge to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia. Trump has also indicated he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine.",
      "Starmer arrived at Kyiv railway station on a gray and frosty morning. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way into this conflict,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let up.\u201d",
      "During the visit, Starmer and Zelenskyy laid flowers at a wall of remembrance for those killed in the war. The wall outside St. Michael\u2019s Golden-Domed Monastery, a Kyiv landmark, is covered in photos of the slain, stretching for a city block. It has become a place of pilgrimage for families paying tribute to their lost loved ones.",
      "Starmer also visited a Kyiv hospital specializing in burn treatment.",
      "While Starmer was later meeting with Zelenskyy at the presidential palace, a car and a building were damaged elsewhere in Kyiv by debris from Russian drones shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, according to city adminstration chief Tymur Tkachenko.",
      "The U.K., one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backers, has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($16 billion) in military and civilian aid since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago, and has trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Starmer is to announce another 40 million pounds ($49 million) for Ukraine\u2019s postwar economic recovery.",
      "But the U.K.\u2019s role is dwarfed by that of the United States, and there is deep uncertainty over the fate of American support for Ukraine once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The president-elect has balked at the cost of U.S. aid to Kyiv, says he wants to bring the war to a swift end and is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long expressed admiration.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war.",
      "Zelenskyy has said that in any peace negotiation, Ukraine would need assurances about its future protection from its much bigger neighbor.",
      "Britain says its 100-year pledge is part of that assurance and will help ensure Ukraine is \u201cnever again vulnerable to the kind of brutality inflicted on it by Russia,\u201d which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and attempted a full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "The deal commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure. Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level,\u201d Starmer said ahead of the visit.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said he and Starmer also would discuss a plan proposed by France\u2019s Macron that could see troops from France and other Western countries stationed in Ukraine to oversee a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Zelenskyy has said any such proposal should go alongside a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO. The alliance\u2019s 32 member countries say that\u00a0Ukraine will join one day, but not until after the war. Trump has appeared to sympathize with Putin\u2019s position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO.",
      "As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains ahead of possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.",
      "Moscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties along the 600-mile front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter. A major Russian ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine on Wednesday compelled authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 09:57:18 GMT",
    "summary": "Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary nominee, appeared stumped when asked about the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.",
    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Sen. Tammy Duckworth, grilling President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary over whether he had the \u201cbreadth and depth of knowledge\u201d needed to lead international negotiations, asked Pete Hegseth if could name one member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, describe what type of agreement the U.S. had with the countries and how many nations were in the bloc.",
      "Hegseth responded at the heated Senate confirmation hearing that he couldn\u2019t tell Duckworth the exact number of ASEAN nations, but that \u201cI know we have allies in South Korea and Japan, and in AUKUS with Australia,\u201d referring to a pact among the U.S., Australia and Britain.",
      "\u201cNone of those three countries are in ASEAN,\u201d responded Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois. \u201cI suggest you do a little homework.\u201d",
      "What is ASEAN, and why is it relevant to the U.S.?",
      "ASEAN is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. An 11th country, East Timor, is set to join soon.",
      "Established in 1967, its goal is to promote regional economic and security cooperation, leveraging a combined population of more than 650 million people with a GDP of more than $3 trillion.",
      "Duckworth\u2019s question came after Hegseth had noted the strategic importance of the Indo-Pacific, a region where China\u2019s influence has been rapidly growing and Beijing has become increasingly assertive in pressing territorial claims.",
      "ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea, one of the world\u2019s most crucial waterways for shipping. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing\u2019s encroachment on its exclusive economic zone.",
      "What does ASEAN have to do with the U.S. secretary of defense?",
      "The U.S. is treaty partners with ASEAN members Thailand and the Philippines, and Washington has sought to harness ASEAN\u2019s regional influence as it seeks to counter Chinese influence and promote what the White House has called \u201ca free and open region that is connected, prosperous, secure and resilient.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden said ASEAN was \u201cat the heart of my administration\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy\u201d and hosted a meeting of ASEAN leaders in Washington in 2022.",
      "ASEAN also holds top-level meetings annually, this year in Malaysia, which holds the rotating chair of the group.",
      "Its defense meetings are typically attended by the U.S. defense secretary, and its foreign minister meetings by the U.S. secretary of state. The meetings culminate with an annual summit, which is regularly attended by the sitting U.S. president. Both Biden and Donald Trump have participated.",
      "Why else is ASEAN important?",
      "Despite some members\u2019 territorial conflicts with China, many in the bloc have close relations with Beijing as well, and top-level Chinese officials also attend ASEAN meetings.",
      "The U.S. in 2022 was elevated to the top-level \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d with ASEAN \u2014 a largely symbolic status that put Washington on the same level with China, which was granted the distinction the year before.",
      "ASEAN emphasizes noninterference and personal diplomacy, and its breadth of membership and partnerships makes it uniquely positioned as a forum to address major geopolitical issues.",
      "Beyond China and the U.S., ASEAN has formal relationships with Russia, India, Australia, the European Union, Britain, Japan, South Korea and many others.",
      "It hosts annual \u201cASEAN Plus Three\u201d meetings with the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan, \u201cASEAN Plus Six\u201d talks that add in the leaders of Australia, India and New Zealand, and the East Asia summit, which includes the six plus Russia and the United States.",
      "The ASEAN nations are also central to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, a free trade agreement that was signed in 2020, creating the largest trade bloc in history.",
      "The 10 nations plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand account for more than 30% of the world\u2019s population and about 30% of global GDP. Conceived at ASEAN\u2019s 2011 summit, the agreement includes commitments on trade in goods and services, investments and other areas."

      "It's a con even more elaborate than \"Oceans 11.\"",
      "A French woman who thought she was in a romantic relationship with Hollywood star Brad Pitt handed over 830,000 euros ($855,000) to scammers as part of an elaborate, yearlong con that involved an AI-generated version of the \"Moneyball\" actor.",
      "To add insult to injury, when she discussed her misfortune on the French television channel TF1, the 53-year-old interior designer known only as \"Anne\" was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling so bad that the station had to pull her interview with its \"Seven to Eight\" show.",
      "\u201cThe story broadcast this Sunday has resulted in a wave of harassment against the witness,\u201d TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his X account Tuesday. \u201cFor the protection of victims, we have decided to withdraw it from our platforms.\u201d",
      "Anne said she began talking to the fake version of the \"Fight Club\" actor sometime in February 2023, after an account posing as Pitt's mother, Jane Etta Pitt, sent her a message on Instagram while she was on a skiing holiday in the French Alps.",
      "Speaking on TF1, Anne said that the account \u201ctold me that her son needed someone like me,\u201d according to AFP.",
      "Over the next few months, she exchanged several messages on different social media and messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, with the fake Pitt, even receiving AI-generated selfies of the 61-year-old actor, whose facsimile told her he needed money for cancer treatment.",
      "\u201cAt first I said to myself that it was fake, that it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not used to social media and I didn\u2019t really understand what was happening to me.\u201d",
      "The request for money came after the scammers told Anne that Pitt was in the hospital with kidney cancer and needed money for the treatment, but that his bank accounts were allegedly frozen because of his divorce proceedings with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.",
      "She was hesitant at first, but eventually transferred the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the fake star\u2019s \u201cdoctor.\u201d",
      "Anne said she finally realized she had been the victim of a scam after she saw pictures of the real Pitt with his current partner, In\u00e8s de Ramon, last summer. \u201cI ask myself why they chose me to do such harm like this?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never harmed anyone. These people deserve hell.\u201d",
      "The French newspaper\u00a0Sud Ouest reported that Anne was going through divorce proceedings with a millionaire entrepreneur at the time. She reportedly suffered from severe depression and was hospitalized following the scam.",
      "Police are now investigating the con, but the interview has nevertheless sparked a deluge of jokes online.",
      "Among the individuals, organizations and companies making jokes at Anne's expense was Netflix France, which promoted \u201cfour films to see with Brad Pitt (really) for free\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Artificial intelligence has increased the risk of identity theft and  fraud online, which contributed to over $8.8 million in losses in the U.S., according to the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "A global study conducted by the computer security company McAfee found that 1 in 4 people worldwide have either experienced an AI-voice cloning scam or know someone who has."

      "Police had stopped food and water supplies from being taken into the mine since August until a court ruled in December that volunteers could send down essential aid for the miners, known locally as \u201czama zamas.\u201d",

      "The death toll makes the crackdown on the Stilfontein mine one of the deadliest on miners in recent South African history. As the toll has mounted, so has criticism of the police and of the government, which says the siege was part of a much-needed crackdown on illegal mining.",
      "\u201cThese miners, many of them undocumented and desperate workers from Mozambique and other Southern African countries, were left to die in one of the most horrific displays of state wilful negligence in recent history,\u201d the South African Federation of Trade Unions said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the second-biggest party in the ruling coalition, said on Wednesday the situation at the mine had got \u201cbadly out of hand\u201d and called for an independent inquiry.",
      "All 166 of the survivors rescued so far were immediately arrested and charged with criminal offences including illegal immigration, trespass and illegal mining, police said. None were hospitalized and all were taken into police custody.",
      "\u201cIf you come out and you are able to walk they take you straight to the cells,\u201d said Mzukisi Jam, a civil society activist, who has been at the site throughout the rescue operation."

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to a ceasefire deal Wednesday that could end 15 months of devastating fighting in the Gaza Strip, even as the Israel military continued to launch airstrikes in the enclave and families of Israeli hostages begged for their safe return.",
      "American, Egyptian and Qatari delegations have been working to secure a truce to end fighting, with officials familiar with the talks taking place in the Qatari capital of Doha saying that an agreement that would see the gradual release of dozens of hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners was on the verge of completion.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that Hamas had not yet responded to the draft agreement, after reports of a breakthrough in Israeli media.",
      "Earlier Wednesday a senior Arab official familiar with negotiations told NBC News that three key points were still being negotiated: the map dictating where exactly Israeli forces will withdraw to, particularly along the Netzarim Corridor that currently splits the Gaza Strip in two; the extent of its withdrawal from the strategic Philadelphi Corridor that flanks Gaza's southern border with Egypt; and the names of Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for Hamas' Oct. 7 captives, as well as the method and location of their release.",
      "Netanyahu's spokesman, David Mencer, told NBC News on Wednesday that the deal was \"awaiting Hamas agreement.\u201d",
      "That comment came after Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said Tuesday that a majority within Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government would support the \u201cgradual deal\u201d being negotiated.",
      "Earlier in the day, a senior Israeli official gave details of the current plans, which involve a 42-day first phase in which 33 hostages, most of whom are believed to be alive, would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. That would be followed by a \"more complicated\" second phase, Sa\u2019ar said.",

That saw Israel launch an air and land assault on Gaza, killing more than 46,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials.",

      "Until that happens, though, the violence continues. At least 17 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza late Tuesday, according to the enclave\u2019s Health Ministry. A separate Israeli strike on Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, killed at least six people, the ministry said.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement it had \u201cstruck more than 50 terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure, anti-tank fire positions, and Hamas military structures.\u201d",
      "Alongside the Palestinians desperate for this bombardment to end, Israelis have for months begged their government to bring home their relatives who were kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. They have often been deeply critical of Netanyahu, whom they accuse of prioritizing the war and keeping together his fractious right-wing coalition government over the safety of their loved ones.",
      "As they have throughout this conflict, thousands of people gathered Tuesday night in the Tel Aviv plaza that has in recent months become known as \u201cHostages Square.\u201d Among them was Moran Stela Yanai, who spent 54 days in captivity after being abducted at the Supernova music festival on the morning of Hamas' surprise attack.",

      "The Bibas family said they had read reports that their relatives were among those set to be freed. Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri and their sons Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 1, were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7.",
      "\"We have learned from experience and disappointment, and therefore, until our loved ones cross the border, there is no end to the story,\" the family said in a statement. \"We are waiting for certainty regarding their release and their condition and ask that you do not contact us during this sensitive period.\""
