      "His freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure.",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Todd Snider, a singer whose thoughtfully freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure in American roots music, has died. He was 59.",
      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",
      "\u201cWhere do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlways creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",
      "But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.",
      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",
      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \u201cFull Circle.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe relayed so much tenderness and sensitivity through his songs, and showed many of us how to look at the world through a different lens,\u201d the Saturday statement from his label read. \u201cHe got up every morning and started writing, always working towards finding his place among the songwriting giants that sat on his record shelves, those same giants who let him into their lives and took him under their wings, who he studied relentlessly.\u201d",
      "Snider would do his best-known and most acclaimed work for Prine's independent label Oh Boy in the early 2000s. It included the albums \u201cNew Connection,\u201d \u201cNear Truths and Hotel Rooms\u201d and \u201cEast Nashville Skyline,\u201d a 2004 collection that's considered by many to be his best.",
      "Those albums yielded his best known songs, \u201cI Can't Complain,\u201d \u201cBeer Run\u201d and \u201cAlright Guy.\u201d",
      "Snider was born and raised in Oregon before settling and making his musical chops in San Marcos, Texas. He eventually made his way to Nashville, and was dubbed by some the unofficial \u201cmayor of East Nashville,\u201d assuming the title from a friend memorialized thusly in his \u201cTrain Song.\u201d In 2021, Snider said a tornado that ripped through the neighborhood home to a vibrant arts scene severely damaged his house.",
      "Snider had an early fan in Jimmy Buffett, who signed the young artist to his record label, Margaritaville, which released his first two albums, 1994's \u201cSongs for the Daily Planet\u201d and 1996's \u201cStep Right Up.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House Historical Association has reclaimed a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell, spending a whopping $7.25 million at auction on Friday.",
      "The four 1940s-era sketches titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d were displayed in the West Wing for years, but were removed in 2022 after a family dispute over who owned them.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 seated on plush-looking red chairs as they waited to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who had received them as a gift from Rockwell.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how personally thrilled I am that the White House Historical Association preserved this piece of White House history,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association\u2019s board of directors.",
      "The White House Historical Association's winning bid was $5.8 million. It's total cost to reclaim the art, including the buyer's premium paid to the auction house, was $7.25 million.",
      "The price tag is by far the most ever paid by the association, which holds a vast collection of art, furniture and other items as part of its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture.",
      "Before Friday, the most the association had paid for an artifact was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "The sketches sold Friday are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, according to Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based auction house that sold them. The series was created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Kristen Wiig steps out of a vintage Rolls-Royce in the opening scene of Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale,\u201d she\u2019s sporting a tall, yellow, fringed hat, gold platform sandals and sunny bell bottoms, with fabric petals that sway with every determined step. It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern. But also playing a starring role are the vintage designer frocks that reflect each character.",
      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",
      "\u201cThe looks are so iconic. Sometimes Kristen will walk in in something, and it brings tears to my eyes,\u201d Kaia Gerber \u2014 who plays Mitzi \u2014 told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The costumes also help set the tone for the female empowerment theme that permeates this season. \u201cEvelyn wore a lot more pants \u2014 which seems ridiculous to say today \u2014 but back then that was a real power move,\u201d Friedberg says.",

      "He's in fact the rare character who repeats outfits, Friedberg notes. \u201cYou can kind of see them, as the series goes along, getting a little bit more and more threadbare,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cIt was so fun to be able to be wearing these expensive gowns and jewelry and the hair and the makeup, and how that really sort of parallels Mitzi\u2019s inner journey as well,\u201d she says.",
      "The costumes may be eye candy, but Friedberg says each look also carries deeper meaning.",
      "\u201cMaxine wears this dress that was an original Oscar de la Renta dress,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much something that Norma would wear, and it is saying to the audience without saying to the audience that she\u2019s arrived, it\u2019s her time, it\u2019s time for her to rule.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The BBC has issued a public apology to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it \u201cstrongly disagreed there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy. Over the past week, it has been embroiled in one of its deepest-ever crisis as its director general stepped down, its head of news quit, questions were raised over the veracity of its journalism and Trump said he is mulling a billion-dollar lawsuit.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",
      "The broadcaster, which is funded by an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all U.K. households who watch live TV or any BBC content, was accused of bias against Trump, symptomatic of they say an inherent liberal bias within the organization.",
      "For days, the BBC said very little, saying it did not report to leaked reports. Many thought that was a misjudgement as it allowed the narrative around the edit to be led by its opponents.",
      "By Nov. 9, the pressure on the BBC was becoming increasingly acute, prompting its top executive, Tim Davie, and head of news Deborah Turness to resign over what the broadcaster called an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d",
      "It was also revealed that Trump was demanding a retraction, apology and compensation over the sequence. \u201cI guess I have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about whether he would go through with his legal threat. \u201cBecause I think they defrauded the public and they\u2019ve admitted it.\u201d",

      "In a statement, it said its chair, Samir Shah, had personally sent a letter via a letter from its chair over the misleading edit but said it had not defamed him.",
      "While the BBC statement doesn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s demand that he be compensated for \u201coverwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u201d the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.",
      "The U.S. president has yet to respond to the BBC's apology and its rejection of of his demands for compensation.",
      "Legal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn\u2019t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.",
      "While many legal experts have dismissed the president\u2019s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.",
      "However this latest crisis pans out in the days and weeks ahead, the heat will remain on the BBC, especially in its newsrooms where any mistake, or seeming bias, will no doubt be picked up opponents.",
      "As a public broadcaster, the BBC has to be impartial in the way it covers news events. It's a fine balancing act that often gets the BBC into trouble. Some think it leans too much to the right, while others think it goes the other way. Whatever the truth of the matter, many think that the BBC is often cowed in its coverage, particularly on domestic political matters.",

      "The four 1940s-era sketches are titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d and depict people from all walks of life hanging out in the White House lobby as they anticipate meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who received them as a gift from Rockwell after a court battle over their ownership was settled.",
      "The sketches are set to be sold by a Dallas-based auction house Friday. In keeping with its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture, including the history of the White House, the association hopes to prevail. It wants to add the drawing to the vast White House collection of art, furniture and other items.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re so different from any of the other art that was exhibited in the West Wing,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association's board of directors.",
      "McBride remembers seeing the drawings in 1981 when she went to work in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. They were a \u201cfocal point\u201d when staffers took visitors on tours, she said. \u201cPeople just loved seeing\u201d the \u201cwide array and depiction of Americans that have access to their president.\u201d",
      "The series, created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post during World War II, \u201coffers an intimate and deeply human portrayal of American democracy in action,\u201d according to a description on the Heritage Auctions website.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 waiting on plush-looking red chairs in the West Wing lobby as they waited to meet Roosevelt. A Secret Service agent stands watch in one of the scenes.",
      "\u201cIn a way, it sort of illustrates how FDR always talked about the \u2018arsenal of democracy\u2019 and what made the United States unique,\u201d said Matthew Costello, the association\u2019s chief education officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible series of renderings.\u201d",
      "The sketches are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, the auction house said.",
      "Rockwell gave the original drawings to Stephen Early, who was Roosevelt's longtime press secretary, seen in a drawing smoking a pipe as reporters huddle around him. A family member turned them over to the White House in 1978, and they were on display throughout the West Wing for more than four decades, sometimes in a hallway between the press offices that are mere steps from the Oval Office.",

      "William Elam III, a grandson of Stephen Early's, said his mother received the drawings as a gift from her father, the former press secretary, before he died, and that ownership had later passed to him.",
      "The illustrations had gone to the White House in 1978 under an agreement which obligated the White House to return them to Elam upon request. The White House gave back the drawings in 2022.",
      "A federal appeals court settled the dispute in May, upholding a lower-court ruling in favor of Elam, according to court records.",
      "Bidding will start at $2.5 million and clients are \u201cready and waiting to compete for this American icon,\u201d Christina Rees, director of communications for Heritage Auctions, said in an email. The auction house has estimated the drawings will sell for between $4 million and $6 million.",
      "That price tag could present a hurdle for the White House Historical Association, which was created in 1961 by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy to help preserve the museum quality of the interior of the White House and educate the public. It is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that receives no government funding. It raises money mostly through private donations and merchandise sales, including an annual Christmas ornament.",
      "The association did not reveal how much it is willing to spend, but the most it has ever paid for a painting in the past was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "McBride said she expected stiff competition for Rockwell's work because of the broad interest in Americana, as well as the artist's work. But the association's mission is to go after art, furniture and other items it believes belong in the White House.",
      "\u201cWe try hard to bring them back,\u201d McBride said.",

      "Sofia Coppola has been honored at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit in New York for her filmmaking achievements",
      "NEW YORK -- When Sofia Coppola was 20 years old and figuring out who she wanted to be in the world, Angelica Huston offered some advice: \u201cNot everyone\u2019s going to love you. Don\u2019t waste your time on the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Coppola recalled Wednesday night in New York at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit, where she was being honored for her films.",
      "Coppola was surrounded by family, friends and collaborators like Bill Murray, Josh Hartnett and Elle Fanning for the Chanel-presented event, which helps raise funds for the museum\u2019s film collection and preservation efforts.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not just the daughter of a great filmmaker,\u201d Murray said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great filmmaker.\u201d",
      "But it's a distinction that was hard earned. Just over 27 years after her father Francis Ford Coppola encouraged her to make her first short film, Coppola reflected on starting a filmmaking career at a time when she was thought of as \u201ca nepo baby before they were charming\u201d and \u201cthe amateur actress who had single-handedly ruined \u2018The Godfather\u2019 films.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people didn\u2019t think I had something to say that mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found a few who did.\u201d",
      "Since making her feature debut with \u201cThe Virgin Suicides,\u201d Coppola has written and directed seven narrative features and one documentary, about Marc Jacobs, that A24 plans to release next year. She's been both celebrated, winning an Oscar for writing \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d which also earned her a best director nomination, and dismissed. \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d was infamously booed at Cannes, but over the next 20 years would become beloved and celebrated.",
      "Fanning remembered meticulously planning her outfit to meet Coppola for the first time at age 11, where she would go on to be cast as the daughter of a famous movie star in \u201cSomewhere.\u201d A few years prior she had convinced her grandmother to take her to see \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d and she immediately became a fan.",
      "\u201cLiving in that cinema, in Sofia\u2019s world for a few hours, it would change my girlhood forever,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cIt was the place that I felt safe and seen, and I wanted to live in it a hundred times over.\u201d",
      "On \u201cSomewhere,\u201d Coppola made Fanning feel like an equal on set and saw beauty in things like her glasses and retainer and made them \u201ccool\u201d through her approval. At 18, she\u2019d reunite with Coppola to play the \u201cbad girl\u201d in the Civil War era film \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d",
      "Hartnett also thanked Coppola for giving him one of his first big roles as a teenage heartthrob in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201d He recalled being in awe of her, the mixtapes she made for the cast and her \u201cincredible chill\u201d under the immense pressure of directing her first feature at only 26.",

      "Filmmaker Lotfy Nathan has turned the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas into a supernatural thriller called \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the second century, as the canonical Gospels were being copied and circulated throughout the Roman Empire, another text about the life of Jesus was simultaneously spreading. Although the Infancy Gospel of Thomas didn\u2019t make it into the New Testament, it remained popular among Christians for centuries.",
      "When filmmaker Lotfy Nathan was introduced to the apocryphal text about Jesus\u2019 childhood by his history-loving father, he immediately began poring over it as a springboard for what would eventually become \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d the supernatural thriller starring Nicolas Cage and opening in theaters Friday.",
      "\u201cThe thought gave me chills,\u201d recalled the writer and director, who was raised Coptic Orthodox. \u201cThe novelty of this, in a way, being an origin story that hadn\u2019t been told before.\u201d",
      "The film, which stars FKA twigs and Noah Jupe alongside Cage, follows Jesus as a young boy being tempted by Satan to rebel against his father, Joseph (Cage). The film\u2019s source material is established with an opening title card. \u201cBased on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas,\u201d it reads. But Nathan concedes he couldn\u2019t rely solely on the text and had to fill in narrative gaps, as with a storyline involving Satan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s written like a laundry list of events. It doesn\u2019t really have an arc, so to speak,\u201d he said of the apocryphal account of Jesus\u2019 life from ages 5 to 12. \u201cI had a historian pull a lot of research for me before I wrote the first draft.\u201d",
      "As fate would have it, Cage had already read the Infancy Gospel of Thomas years ago, during a period in his life of deep philosophical curiosity and reflection. When Nathan came to the Oscar winner with the script, Cage said he saw a through line to a type of story he\u2019s long been attracted to.",
      "\u201cFamily dramas, it\u2019s no secret, is one of my favorite subject matters or genres. I couldn\u2019t think of a more compelling family dynamic than the Nativity,\u201d Cage told The Associated Press. \u201cAs I read it and thought about it, I never thought of it as a horror film per se. I saw it as a family drama about an existential crisis.\u201d",
      "The Infancy Gospel of Thomas might seem novel and obscure for some contemporary audiences, but history attests to both its popularity and longevity, according to Tony Burke, a professor at York University in Toronto whose specialties include early Christian apocrypha.",
      "Stories within it permeated ancient Christian lore, art and even some medieval plays. One account from the text about Jesus giving life to clay birds even made its way into the Quran.",
      "Also referred to as the Paidika \u2014 a nod to its original Greek title, \u201cPaidika Iesou,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe Childhood Acts of Jesus\u201d \u2014 the Infancy Gospel of Thomas often surprises modern readers.",
      "\u201cThis is not the Jesus that they expect \u2014 a Jesus that kills a boy in the marketplace or strikes down his teacher,\u201d Burke said, though he argues that Christian audiences during that time wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by this characterization. \u201cIn the ancient world, it was not that uncommon to tell stories of revered holy men cursing as well as blessing.\u201d",

      "The Paidika is one of two primary infancy gospels from that time \u2014 the other being the Infancy Gospel of James \u2014 that were popular among early Christians. \u201cThey never became canonical in the strict sense, but they were always kind of something on the periphery,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Although Jesus movies aren't often described as horror films or supernatural thrillers, the second century text upon which \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d is based is \u201cquite disturbing,\u201d argues Joan E. Taylor, a professor of early Christianity at King\u2019s College London. She recently wrote \u201cBoy Jesus: Growing Up Judaean in Turbulent Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cJesus is portrayed as having these powers but not really having the moral compass in terms of how he uses his powers, or at least not the moral compass we would expect from, say, the Gospel of Luke,\u201d she said of the Paidika. \u201cYou have this child who has these supernatural powers and punishes those who come in his way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d isn\u2019t the only recent film to reimagine the apocryphal gospel. \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d the 2016 drama based upon Anne Rice's novel \u201cChrist the Lord: Out of Egypt,\u201d also pulls from the Paidika.",
      "Both films reinterpret some of the aspects of the text that are ostensibly at odds with the Jesus of the canonical Gospels. In \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d for example, it\u2019s Satan who kills the boy in the marketplace, then frames Jesus. That encounter is left out of \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d entirely.",
      "Despite their popularity, telling any story about Jesus on-screen is tricky, especially when filmmakers veer into territory outside of the canonical Gospels. Cage recalled seeing \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s notoriously controversial 1988 drama starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus, in theaters when it first came out.",
      "\u201cI was in line to get my tickets and I remember there were the picketers and they were angry. And I said, \u2018Well have you seen the movie?\u2019 And they said no,\u201d Cage recalled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should see it before you make a statement about it or judge it?\u201d",
      "Still, he\u2019s cognizant of the fact that any film tackling subjects sacred to people is vulnerable to critique. The American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has denounced the film and urged people to sign a petition blocking its release.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to offend anybody in the making of this movie,\u201d Cage said emphatically. \u201cIf anyone does go to this movie, they would see that everyone treated it with love and not with any approach of mockery or contempt. It was all about love.\u201d",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",
      "\u201cChinese female readers can no longer find a safe, uncensored space to place our desires,\u201d said Zhong, an educator in her 30s.",
      "Writers have said they enjoy directing lives that aren\u2019t their own.",
      "\u201cWhen I was writing, I felt so powerful that I could create a world,\u201d said Zou Xuan, a teacher who used to write Danmei for fun and has been reading them for a decade.",
      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",

      "Weinstein\u2019s bid to overturn his first-degree criminal sex act conviction \u201cutterly fails, on both the law and the facts, to meet the standard necessary to set aside the guilty verdict,\u201d prosecutors Matthew Colangelo, Nicole Blumberg, Shannon Lucey and Becky Mangold wrote.",
      "They cited a centuries-old rule that the U.S. Supreme Court has said gives \u201csubstantial protection to verdict finality\u201d and assures that once a trial is over, jurors won\u2019t be \"harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict.\u201d",

      "The two jurors said in their affidavits that they felt overwhelmed and intimidated by others on the panel who wanted to convict Weinstein on the criminal sex act charge, which accused him of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006.",
      "One of the jurors said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \u201cI would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",

      "The Oscar-winning producer has been behind bars since his initial conviction in 2020, and he later also was sentenced to prison in a separate California case, which he is appealing.",

      "Meghan Trainor will release her seventh studio album in April",
      "NEW YORK -- In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives \u2014 but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial \u201cStill Don't Care,\u201d the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, \u201cToy with Me,\u201d out April 24.",
      "And in true Trainor fashion, \u201cStill Don't Care\u201d was inspired by real life situations. \u201cI was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn\u2019t really expect that,\u201d Trainor told The Associated Press. \u201cI would get really upset at comments and I was like, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. I wish I didn\u2019t give them so much power.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like \u2018All About That Bass.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like that when I wrote it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.\u201d",
      "\u201cStill Don't Care\u201d is yet another example, with its maximalist, \u201880s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix\u2019s Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well \u2014 perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. \u201cYou could tear me apart,\u201d Trainor sings. \u201cBut I sleep well at night.\u201d",
      "It's the first taste of \u201cToy with Me,\u201d which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. \u201cThe only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It\u2019s called \u2018Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhen I play it, Riley goes, \u2018Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It\u2019s literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, \u2018I love you, Mama,\u2019 and it\u2019s just the cutest thing ever.

      "Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. \u201cI exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard.

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 \u201cLast Samurai Standing,\u201d a Netflix series launching on Thursday, is set in a Japan where the feudal samurai era is about to end.",
      "The hero, Saga Kokushu, played by Junichi Okada, is one of dozens of samurai in a live-or-die survival game to save family, community and honor. Participants receive wooden tags to wear and add another for each rival they kill. The last man standing collects 100 billion yen ($650 million).",
      "Directed by Michihito Fujii, whose credits include \u201cThe Journalist,\u201d about a fearless reporter, and \u201cA Family,\u201d depicting yakuza gangsters, the series pays homage to modern-day video games as well as the legacy of Japanese filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and the original \u201cThe Last Samurai.\u201d",
      "That 2003 film, directed by Edward Zwick, starred Tom Cruise as the samurai hero. It was a big hit, including in Japan, and it helped Japan\u2019s own stars like Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada in their Hollywood careers.",
      "\u201cThe purpose we had in mind was to update the jidaigeki,\u201d said Okada, using the Japanese term for the samurai drama genre.",
      "Okada, who also served as choreographer and producer in \u201cLast Samurai Standing,\u201d said everybody in Japanese film knew so much about the greats who had preceded them, like Kurosawa. The genre even came with a grandiose \u201ctextbook\u201d about the proper portrayal of Japanese culture.",
      "\u201cWe took the want-to approach, keeping in mind that, while thoroughly studying jidaigeki, we were going to do what we want to make, and make something that looked absolutely cool,\u201d Okada told The Associated Press.",
      "Okada is a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. He has starred in various films including \u201cThe Eternal Zero,\u201d about World War II Zero pilots, directed by Takashi Yamazaki, of \u201cGodzilla Minus One.\u201d",
      "Okada previously worked with director Fujii in \u201cHard Days,\u201d a 2023 film about a police officer who tries to cover up a hit-and-run. Okada handpicked Fujii for \u201cLast Samurai Standing.\u201d",

      "Billed as \u201cThe Great Melbourne Bagpipe Bash,\u201d the eclectic performance took place in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square, on Swanston Street, which was the scene of the Australian hard rock band\u2019s 1976 film clip in which they played the hit on the back of a flatbed truck traveling slowly through downtown traffic with music blaring from speakers.",

      "The Monkey King, a beloved figure in Chinese mythology, is now the star of an opera",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A rascally superhero born from a stone egg, the Monkey King is beloved in Chinese mythology, appearing in everything from a 16th century epic to modern comics, animated movies and video games \u2014 even in poetry by Mao Zedong.",
      "And now he\u2019s the star of an opera.",
      "\u201cThe Monkey King,\u201d with music by Huang Ruo and libretto by David Henry Hwang, has its world premiere at the San Francisco Opera on Friday with performances through Nov. 30.",
      "It\u2019s adapted from \u201cJourney to the West,\u201d a 100-chapter novel inspired by the true story of a 7th-century Chinese monk who traveled to India to find Buddhist sutras, or scriptures, and bring them back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially an allegory of how Buddhism came to China,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "His libretto, in both English and Mandarin, is based on early chapters of the epic, portraying Monkey King\u2019s birth and daring exploits, as well as the arrogance and pride that lead him to be imprisoned for 500 years until he learns humility, compassion and discipline. At the end of the opera he is finally worthy of accompanying the monk on his journey.",
      "For Hwang, part of the Monkey King\u2019s appeal is the way he undercuts stereotypes.",
      "\u201cEveryone associates the Chinese persona with respect and deference and conformity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Monkey represents this whole other side that doesn\u2019t normally get expressed in terms of being individualistic, being rebellious, being egotistical.",
      "\u201cAlso given the fact that Monkey is rebelling against a corrupt administration, people can look at that however they want to see it.\u201d",
      "Mounting the opera is an ambitious undertaking for the company, which has a long track record of producing new work but faced unique challenges in bringing Monkey\u2019s fantastical adventures to life.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s flying on clouds, diving underwater, soaring to the heavens,\u201d director Diane Paulus said. \u201cI thought, oh, my gosh, how are we going to do this on the stage? How do we realize this and in what style?\u201d",
      "One answer was to collaborate with puppeteer Basil Twist, who designed the sets as well as puppets, making extensive use of his trademark silks.",
      "\u201cThe whole notion of the ephemeral and letting go of things and the power of transformation to me is beautifully expressed by silk that can become water that then disappears and becomes clouds, and then becomes a giant column,\u201d she said.",
      "Since Monkey King has to perform supernatural feats, engage in acrobatic fighting, shift his shape at will, and also \u2014 this is an opera, after all \u2014 perform arias accompanied by full orchestra, the creators represent him by three different figures: a singer, a puppet and a dancer.",
      "\u201cI call it the Holy Trinity of Monkey King,\u201d said Kang Wang, the Chinese-Australian tenor who sings the title role.",
      "While that spares Wang from having to perform backflips or other complicated dance moves, it doesn\u2019t mean he can stand up straight the whole time. Whenever he\u2019s not singing full out, he has to crouch in a semi-squat the way a character would who is half-monkey, half-man.",

      "\u201cThese viruses behave similarly,\u201d said Richard Webby, a prominent flu researcher at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. \u201cMy gut instinct is to consider it the same as H5N1 from a human health perspective.\u201d",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson said the agency was not involved in this investigation and could not speak definitively about whether it's the first such death.

      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",
      "A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.",

None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.",
      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",
      "There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.",

      "And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.",
      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.",

      "Vance\u2019s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress, has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change.",
      "\u201cOf all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven't been asking in a long time,\u201d Vance told Kennedy onstage.",
      "The Vance-Kennedy event was livestreamed, but the summit was otherwise off limits to the press.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump and Kennedy have disagreed on issues from COVID-19 vaccines to abortion, the White House this year has largely left Kennedy alone as he has made sweeping changes to the agencies he leads, including laying off thousands of workers, firing science advisers and remaking vaccine guidelines.",
      "The Trump administration has touted Kennedy's efforts to phase out artificial dyes in foods, wage war on ultra-processed foods and update the national dietary guidelines. As health secretary, he has said he wants to find the root causes of chronic disease and help Americans reduce their exposure to toxins.",

      "About 8.3 million people across the globe were reported as newly diagnosed with TB in 2024. Not all infections are diagnosed and the new numbers represent 78% of the estimated number of people who actually fell ill last year, the WHO noted.",
      "WHO officials see the increase as an indication that screening and treatment are improving after health care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, the number of deaths caused by TB fell in 2024 to 1.23 million, down from 1.25 million the year before.",
      "U.S. tuberculosis cases continued to rise last year \u2014 reaching the highest level in more than a dozen years, according to preliminary data released earlier this year. The vast majority of U.S. TB cases are diagnosed in people born in other countries.",
      "Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, and is spread through the air when an infectious person coughs or sneezes. Roughly a quarter of the global population is estimated to have TB, but only a fraction develop symptoms. It can be fatal if not treated, and is one of the top causes of death worldwide.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.",
      "The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions \u2014 including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers \u2014 to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands.",

      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.",
      "\u201cWe told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \"They never achieve the objective that you announce. And guess what? You haven\u2019t achieved that objective yet, and you\u2019re not going to.\u201d",
      "The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.",

      "\u201cThey knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House Wednesday \u201cleaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,\u201d said Rep.

      "The House had not been in legislative session since Sept. 19, when it passed a short-term measure to keep the government open when the new budget year began in October. Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.",
      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

      "The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills.",
      "Here's a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end:",
      "Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden's big energy and health care bill, and it's set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",

      "\u201cRepublicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said.",
      "Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail.",
      "Thune's position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. \u201cOpen up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,\u201d Schumer said then.",
      "The first year of President Donald Trump's second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration's deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don't align with the administration's priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled.",
      "Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump's efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump's big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "The Democrats' struggles to blunt the Trump administration's priorities has prompted calls for the party's congressional leadership to take a more forceful response.",
      "Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.",

      "But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party's left flank when he refused to go along.",

      "Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a \u201cbig factor, negative\" for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP's stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown.",
      "Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress.

    "story": [
      "International health experts say Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America",
      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",
      "It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.",
      "\u201cIt's a deeply disheartening development. It's a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it's an embarrassing development,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. \u201cNo country with the amount of resources of Canada \u2014 or other countries in North America even \u2014 should lose their measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",
      "It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cAs a region, we have eliminated measles twice,\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cWe can do it a third time.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",
      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",
      "In 2024, the region had a 79% vaccination rate, an increase from years past but still too low, he said.",

      "A major question now is if either are linked to the Texas outbreak. To lose elimination status, health data must show a continuous chain of measles spread for one year.",
      "International health officials have recommended the U.S. \u201cenhance case investigation protocols,\u201d because closing data gaps is key to stopping the virus from taking hold again, said Dr. Daniel Salas, who leads immunization efforts at the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,681 cases and 44 outbreaks this year, making it the worst year for measles in the U.S. in more than three decades. Only nine states haven\u2019t confirmed cases, according to the CDC.",
      "A large outbreak also continues in Chihuahua, Mexico, where health officials have confirmed 4,430 cases as of last week and 21 deaths, according to state health data.",
      "Mexican and U.S. officials have said the genetic strains of measles spreading in Canada match those in the Texas and Chihuahua outbreaks. All those outbreaks affected certain Mennonite Christian communities who trace their migration over generations from Canada to Mexico to Seminole, Texas.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is again asking the Supreme Court to keep full food aid payments on hold",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration returned to the Supreme Court on Monday in a push to keep full payments in the SNAP federal food aid program frozen while the government is shut down, even as some families struggled to put food on the table.",
      "The request is the latest in a flurry of legal activity over how the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries should proceed during the historic U.S. government shutdown. Lower courts have ruled that the government must keep full payments flowing, but the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to keep them frozen for now.",
      "The high court is expected to rule Tuesday.",
      "The seesawing rulings so far have created a situation where beneficiaries in some states, including Hawaii and New Jersey, have received their full monthly allocations and those in others, such as Nebraska and West Virginia, have seen nothing.",
      "Brandi Johnson, 48, of St. Louis, said she\u2019s struggling to make the $20 she has left in her SNAP account stretch. Johnson said she has been skipping meals the past two weeks to make sure her three teenage children have something to eat. She is also helping care for her infant granddaughter, who has food allergies, and her 80-year-old mother.",
      "She said food pantries have offered little help in recent days. Many require patrons to live in a certain ZIP code or are dedicated to helping the elderly first.",
      "\u201cI think about it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, literally,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to figure out how you\u2019re going to eat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration argued that lower court orders requiring the full funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program wrongly affect ongoing negotiations in Congress about ending the shutdown. Supreme Court Solicitor General D. John Sauer called the funding lapse tragic, but said judges shouldn't be deciding how to handle it.",
      "The Senate Monday passed a compromise funding package that would end the government shutdown and refill SNAP funds. It now goes to the House for consideration.",
      "Trump\u2019s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November\u2019s benefits entirely.",
      "The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn\u2019t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.",
      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states \u2014 all with Democratic governors \u2014 received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell\u2019s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court.",
      "Millions more people still have not received SNAP payments for November, because their states were waiting on guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP. Several states have made partial payments, including Texas, where officials said money was going on cards for some beneficiaries Monday.",
      "\u201cContinued delays deepen suffering for children, seniors, and working families, and force nonprofits to shoulder an even heavier burden,\u201d Diane Yentel, President and CEO, National Council of Nonprofits, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. \u201cIf basic decency and humanity don\u2019t compel the administration to assure food security for all Americans, then multiple federal court judges finding its actions unlawful must.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s administration has argued that the judicial order to provide full benefits violates the Constitution by infringing on the spending power of the legislative and executive branches.",
      "Wisconsin, which was among the first to load full benefits after McConnell\u2019s order, had its federal reimbursement frozen. The state\u2019s SNAP account could be depleted as soon as Monday, leaving no money to reimburse stores that sell food to SNAP recipients, according to a court filing.",

      "The Vatican has returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada as part of the Catholic Church\u2019s reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas.",
      "Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops during an audience. According to a joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church, the pieces were a gift and a \u201cconcrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\u201d",
      "The items were part of the Vatican Museum\u2019s ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens that was a highlight of that year\u2019s Holy Year.",
      "The Vatican insists the items were \u201cgifts\u201d to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church\u2019s global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government\u2019s forced assimilation policy of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d",
      "Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections.",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church\u2019s role in running Canada\u2019s disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including an Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \u201cIn the case where you can return things, where it\u2019s necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\u201d",
      "The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome.",
      "\u201cThis is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\u201d said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Steel: 50%. Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%. But an even bigger Trump-era levy looms: 107 % on Italian pasta.",
      "Mamma mia.",
      "It started with the U.S. Commerce Department launching what it says was a routine antidumping review, based on allegations Italian pasta makers sold product into the US at below-market prices and undercut local competitors. That has led to a threat of 92% duties, which would come on top of the 15% tariff President Donald Trump\u2019s administration imposed on European exports generally.",
      "The news sent shockwaves through Italy, where 13 producers would be subject to the whopping one-two punch. They say sales in their second biggest export market would shrivel if prices to American consumers more than double. And while the measure would hardly prompt pasta shortages, it still has perplexed importers like Sal Auriemma, whose shop in Philadelphia\u2019s Italian market, Claudio Specialty Food, has been operating for over 60 years.",
      "\u201cPasta is a pretty small sector to pick on. I mean, there\u2019s a lot bigger things to pick on,\" said Auriemma, pointing to luxury items as an alternative.",
      "But pasta? \u201cIt\u2019s basic food,\u201d he said. \"Something\u2019s got to be sacred.\u201d",
      "Italy is a nation of avid pasta eaters. Less known is that most of the tortellini, spaghetti and rigatoni its factories churn out gets sent abroad. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of its \u20ac4 billion ($4.65 billion) in exports, making it Italy\u2019s largest market after Germany, data from farmers\u2019 association Coldiretti show.",
      "The punitive pasta premium has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for Italy\u2019s politicians, executives and economists. Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida told lawmakers in mid-October that the government was working with the European Commission and engaging in diplomatic efforts, while supporting the companies\u2019 legal actions to oppose U.S. sanctions.",
      "EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic addressed reporters in Rome last month, stressing the lack of evidence backing the U.S. decision and calling the combined 107% levy \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Margherita Mastromauro, president of the pasta makers sector of Unione Italiana Food, told The Associated Press that prices for Italian pasta in the U.S. remain high, and certainly higher than American-made rivals \u2014 undermining any dumping claim.",

      "It's a divine sign in an ancient legend, according to which the god Huitzilopochtli asked a group called the Mexica \u2014 who founded what was later known as the Aztec Empire \u2014 to leave their homeland in search of a place to establish a new city.",
      "It took some 175 years before they spotted the sacred omen and established the city of Tenochtitlan in 1325 where Mexico City stands today.",
      "How the eagle, the cactus and the serpent became an emblem and endured through the European conquest is the focus of a new exhibition. \u201cA coat of arms, an emblem, a symbol of identity,\u201d runs through Dec. 15 at the Old City Hall in downtown Mexico City.",
      "The exhibit is among the government\u2019s activities marking the 700th anniversary of the founding of the Mexica capital.",
      "\u201cRecognizing Tenochtitlan doesn\u2019t mean recalling a dead past, but rather the living heartbeat that still beats beneath our city,\u201d President Claudia Sheinbaum said during an official ceremony in July. \u201cIt was the center of an Indigenous world that built its own model of civilization \u2014 one in harmony with the Earth, the stars, and its gods and goddesses.\u201d",

      "Curated by researcher Guadalupe Lozada, it also displays images portraying how it was adopted by the religious orders in charge of converting the Indigenous people to Catholicism.",
      "While the eagle and cactus were already adopted by Europeans in the mid-16th century, the Jesuits introduced the serpent decades later. \u201cFrom then on, it would remain a symbol of the city\u2019s identity \u2014 one that would also spread throughout the rest of New Spain,\u201d Lozada said.",
      "According to her, plenty of monasteries dating back to the 17th century attest to how friars displayed the eagle and cactus in their sanctuaries. Even today, the emblem can still be seen above the fa\u00e7ade of Mexico City\u2019s cathedral and inside one of its chapels.",

      "Tymur Mindich has been named as the mastermind behind a $100 million embezzlement scheme in Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Before the revelation of a multi-million dollar embezzlement and kickbacks scandal involving Ukraine's state nuclear energy company brought his name to the forefront, Tymur Mindich was a shadowy presence \u2014 navigating deals and moving behind the scenes with unseen influence, known to many, yet rarely spoken of.",
      "Mindich was linked to growing fears over his expanding influence within the country\u2019s lucrative industries, his access facilitated by his ties to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two were once business partners and Mindich\u2019s influence had expanded under Zelenskyy's tenure.",
      "The full extent of that influence was exposed this week when Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption watchdogs released the findings of a 15-month investigation into a $100 million embezzlement scheme involving top officials and Ukraine\u2019s state nuclear power company, accusing Mindich of being the mastermind behind the plot.",
      "Mindich has fled the country, with any criminal proceedings against him likely to be carried out in absentia. Two top government ministers have resigned.",
      "Ukrainian officials, experts and activists contend Mindich\u2019s rise to power is closely tied to his privileged relationship with the president and Zelenskyy's inner circle.",
      "\u201cWhat we were hearing only as rumors now has some evidence,\u201d said activist Tetiana Shevchuk, of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. \u201cFor a long time we have heard that Tymur Mindich is a shadow controller of the energy sector.\u201d",
      "Until Zelenskyy\u2019s presidency, Mindich, 46, was just one among many wealthy Ukrainian entertainment industry entrepreneurs.",
      "Mindich was a co-owner of Zelenskyy's production company Kvartal 95, named for the comedy troupe that helped catapult the Ukrainian president to fame as a comedian before he entered politics. Zelenskyy transferred his stake in the company to his partners after he was elected.",
      "Despite expanding his business portfolio since Zelenskyy\u2019s election, Mindich maintained ties to the entertainment world. Until the corruption probe was exposed this week, he was a producer of the comedy show \u201cStadium Family\u201d on YouTube. In light of the scandal and his tarnished reputation, the show\u2019s owners shut it down this week.",
      "He is also a relative of Leonid Mindich, who was arrested by Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption watchdogs in June when he was trying to flee the country, according to local reports; he was charged with embezzling $16 million from an electric power company.",
      "Zelenskyy and Mindich\u2019s close friendship is documented. The president used Mindich\u2019s armored car during the final stretch of his presidential campaign in 2019. In January 2021, Zelenskyy celebrated his birthday in Mindich's apartment during COVID. The two own apartments in the same building.",
      "After Zelenskyy\u2019s 2019 presidential win, Mindich's political ties grew.",
      "He was a close business associate of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, who backed Zelenskyy\u2019s presidential campaign. Zelenskyy later cut ties with the billionaire and in 2023 Kolomoysky was arrested by Ukrainian security services on fraud and money-laundering charges.",

      "They include agricultural enterprises and the nationalized SENSE bank. But, his name appeared most often in association with state energy companies, according to current and former Ukrainian officials, activists and experts.",
      "Ukrainian activists contend that without his close association with Zelenskyy, it would have been impossible for Mindich to cement his rise.",
      "Mindich \u201cwould have never been in politics, never been in a position of power or business without his connection to Zelenskyy, and this magnitude is worse because it\u2019s happening during war time, and it is related to energy infrastructure at a time when Ukrainians don\u2019t have electricity in their homes,\u201d Shevchuk said.",
      "The case against Mindich rests on 1,000 hours of wiretaps revealing his significant influence over Herman Haluschenko, Ukraine\u2019s energy minister from 2021-2025 until he was named justice minister in July. Haluschenko resigned that post after the investigation became public this week.",
      "While rarely named as a direct beneficiary in official documents, investigators cite extensive wire-tapping evidence they allege shows Mindich exerted control over a network of loyalists who pressured contractors for Energoatom, the state nuclear power company, demanding kickbacks of up to 15% to bypass bureaucratic obstacles and do business smoothly.",
      "Investigators allege the illicit funds were siphoned off, laundered through shell companies and funneled into Mindich's pockets and those of his associates.",
      "These findings collected by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, known as NABU, and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, or SAPO will be central to any future court proceedings.",
      "NABU is also conducting an investigation into Mindich\u2019s alleged dealings with Ukraine\u2019s top drone manufacturer, Fire Point, but has not yet revealed its findings. Fire Point, which develops deep-strike drones capable of hitting targets inside Russian territory, has denied any such dealings.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s domestic drone industry has seen a swift and remarkable rise, fueled by wartime innovation and urgent military demands. What was once a niche sector quickly evolved into a formidable technological force within just a few years.",
      "Fire Point is among local companies and startups that have rapidly developed advanced drones for reconnaissance, surveillance and combat operations, supported by growing investments. The NABU investigation is looking into whether Mindich is the ultimate beneficiary of the company.",

      "NINOSHIMA, Japan -- Baumkuchen originated in Germany but has become a wildly popular sweet in Japan, where a prisoner of war on a small western island started making the treat that has thrived in its new homeland.",
      "Today, the confectionery known as \u201ctree cake\u201d because of the resemblance to a trunk with rings is considered a symbol of longevity and prosperity in Japan, where Baumkuchen festivals are regularly held.",
      "Japanese adaptations, including those using maccha and sweet potatoes, are popular gifts at weddings and birthdays. Baumkuchen is sold in gift boxes at luxury department stores and individually wrapped, smaller versions can be found at convenience stores.",
      "The sweet's early years, however, are associated with a catastrophic earthquake and two world wars.",
      "Making Baumkuchen is one of most popular activities on Ninoshima, just a 20-minute ferry ride from Hiroshima. But visitors also must learn the sleepy island\u2019s role in Japan\u2019s wartime history, according to Kazuaki Otani, head of the Juccheim Ninoshima Welcome Center.",
      "At the outdoor center built over the site of a prisoner of war camp, amateur bakers pour batter on a bamboo pole and roast the mixture over a charcoal fire. As the surface turns light brown, a new layer is poured, creating brown rings as the cake grows thicker and the sweet smell wafts through the picnic area.",
      "This is how a German confectioner named Karl Juchheim baked Baumkuchen while he was imprisoned on the island more than 100 years ago.",
      "During Japan\u2019s militarist expansion period beginning in the late 1890s, Ninoshima served as a military quarantine station as nearby Hiroshima developed into a major military hub. About 4,700 mostly German civilians and servicemembers were kept at 16 camps across Japan during World War I. The German prisoners at Ninoshima were given \u201ca certain degree of freedom\u201d and allowed to cook, Otani said.",
      "Juchheim was running a bakery in Qingdao, China, then a German territory, when he was captured by the Japanese in 1915. He arrived on Ninoshima in 1917 with some 500 German POWs and is believed to have tested his Baumkuchen recipe there, Otani said.",

His handmade cake was hugely popular and attracted a big crowd of Japanese visitors, historical documents show.",
      "The confectioner opened a pastry shop in Yokohama, near Tokyo, in 1922. The 1923 Great Kanto quake destroyed the business and forced Juchheim to move his family to the western port city of Kobe, where he opened a coffee shop serving Baumkuchen. That store was leveled by U.S. firebombings on Kobe two months before the end of World War II.",
      "Yet he remained and grew the business in Kobe, where Juchheim Co., Ltd., still operates as one of Japan\u2019s top confectioners with the help of his wife Elise and devoted Japanese staff.",
      "The atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and another on Nagasaki three days later killed more than 210,000 by the end of that year. In the aftermath, about 10,000 severely injured victims were shipped from Hiroshima to Ninoshima for treatment and temporary shelter. Most died there and many of their remains have yet to be found, experts say.",

      "A Brazilian Supreme Court panel has ruled that Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of former President Jair Bolsonaro, should stand trial for obstructing justice",
      "SAO PAULO -- Judges on Brazil 's Supreme Court voted Friday to put one of the sons of former President Jair Bolsonaro on trial on charges of obstructing justice in connection with his father\u2019s attempted coup case.",
      "Justices Fl\u00e1vio Dino and Cristiano Zanin joined colleague Alexandre de Moraes \u2014 who has been appointed to gather preliminary information in the case \u2014 in accepting an indictment by prosecutors alleging that Eduardo Bolsonaro used violence or serious threats to interfere with a legal proceeding.",
      "If convicted, he could face one to four years in prison and a fine.",
      "Prosecutors said that Eduardo Bolsonaro tried to interfere in his father's trial by urging foreign governments to pressure Brazilian officials, including with threats against the country's economy.",
      "Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker now in self-exile in the United States, called the charges against him baseless and described them as political persecution.",
      "A majority of three justices is needed for the trial against Eduardo Bolsonaro to go forward, and Friday's vote on a five-member panel of the Supreme Court means he is virtually assured of going on trial, at least in absentia. Technically, however, the voting remains open until Nov. 25 and any justice could change their vote before then, though that would be highly unusual.",
      "Jair Bolsonaro was convicted in September of attempting a coup following his 2022 electoral defeat and was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison. He has been under house arrest since August.",
      "In July, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods and cited in part the former president\u2019s case, which he called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "The U.S. government also sanctioned de Moraes, who oversees the criminal case against Bolsonaro, under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of human rights abuse and corrupt officials. De Moraes\u2019 wife and other Brazilian officials were also sanctioned or had their visas revoked.",

      "A surge in organized crime from Venezuela and other countries in recent years has reshaped Chilean politics",
      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Fans sported MAGA-style caps. AC/DC blasted from the speakers. Red, white and blue flags flapped in the wind. Crowds whooped and cheered as the man of the hour lamented the surge of migrants across the border.",
      "\u201cThis country isn\u2019t falling apart,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cIt is being shot to pieces, by bullets.\u201d",
      "You\u2019d be forgiven for assuming this was a rally for U.S. President Donald Trump. After all, the U.S. president's name adorned plenty of campaign merch.",
      "But this eruption of visceral rage at immigrants and incumbents took place in Santiago, Chile, at the final campaign event for Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian candidate gaining traction before Sunday's presidential election in Chile, where rising fears of uncontrolled migration have pushed everyone in this race \u2014 even the governing coalition's Communist candidate, Jeannette Jara \u2014 to the right.",
      "Kaiser is \u201cthe only one with a firm hand, the only one who can pull us out of the United Nations, close the borders to all the Venezuelan criminals and throw them in prison in El Salvador,\u201d said Claudia Belmonte, 50, peering out from beneath the brim of a red baseball cap emblazoned with Kaiser\u2019s promise to \u201cMake Chile Great Again.\u201d",
      "Such demands for a \u201cmano dura,\" a \u201cfirm hand,\u201d against crime and disorder have reshaped Chilean politics as transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua surged across porous borders from crisis-stricken Venezuela and elsewhere in recent years, importing kidnappings, contract killings and other violent crimes previously unseen in one of Latin America's safest nations.",
      "\u201cPeople in Chile never had problems with foreigners. But you hear about a gang burying someone alive in your neighborhood and it changes you,\u201d said Carlos Jadu\u00e9, 49, a lemon vendor in central Santiago. \u201cI'm not racist. I see new people coming in. And I see new crimes.\u201d",
      "The anti-migrant backlash has transformed a nation that just four years ago elected the bright young hope of the Latin American left, President Gabriel Boric, a millennial former protest leader who handily defeated the ultraconservative lawyer Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast in 2021 with vows to \u201cbury neoliberalism\" in response to demands of the nation's 2019 social upheaval.",
      "This time around, experts say Chile's nativist fears over illegal immigration give Kast a better shot, even if he's unlikely to clinch the 50% of votes needed to win outright in Sunday\u2019s first round. Polls show Kast facing off against Jara in a runoff on Dec. 14.",
      "In Santiago, there are few vestiges left of the 2019 mass protests against endemic social inequities \u2014 known here as \u201cel estallido\u201d or \u201cthe explosion\" \u2014 in which as many as a million Chileans marched to vent a generation\u2019s worth of economic and political grievances.",
      "One is the stone plinth in the city's Plaza Italia, the central square where protesters battled nightly with police, torching buildings and braving bird shot. The bronze statue of 19th-century Chilean war hero Gen. Manuel Baquedano was defaced, then taken down for what authorities promised would be a quick restoration.",
      "Four years later, the stone plinth, scarred by anti-government graffiti, remains empty and freighted with symbolism. For protesters, it's a reminder of all that's unaddressed. Neoliberalism is alive and well. Chile retains the 1980 constitution adopted by military dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet after Boric twice failed to change it.",
      "For critics, it's a reminder of the lawlessness that struck Chile, a stable prosperous nation that long distinguished itself from its more volatile neighbors. Many Chileans trace their feelings of insecurity back to those days of civil strife, when everything they knew about their country burst.",

      "Jara advocates raising the minimum wage, but, in stark contrast to Boric, proposes no changes to Chile's market-led economic model. The former labor minister and union leader dropped plans to nationalize lithium and copper mining. Her platform calls insecurity her \u201ctop priority.\u201d",
      "\u201cObservers say this is an election between two extremes \u2014 a communist candidate, two far-right candidates,\u201d said Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile. \u201cBut actually, there\u2019s quite a lot of consensus on things like immigration.\u201d",

After two failed presidential bids, Kast has found his tough-on-migration platform holds more appeal than his culture war battles. Yet for all his vows to deport tens of thousands of people and build a giant border wall, Kast looks moderate next to Kaiser.",

      "The statistical blackout meant that the Federal Reserve, businesses, policymakers and investors have largely been in the dark about inflation, job creation, GDP growth and other measures of the U.S. economic health since late summer.",
      "Thomas Simons and Michael Bacolas at Jefferies, a financial firm, wrote in a commentary Friday that over 30 reports from the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau were delayed by the political standoff.",

      "The Labor Department did release its consumer price index for September \u2014 the most popular measurement of inflation \u2014 nine days late on Oct. 24. The government made an exception for that report because of its urgency: It is used to calculate the annual cost of living adjustment for tens of millions of Americans receiving Social Security and other federal benefits.",
      "The interruption of federal economic statistics came at an awkward time. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 sweeping, ever-changing import taxes and massive deportations of people working in the United States illegally \u2014 are creating uncertainty about the economic outlook.",
      "And the economy has sent conflicting signals: Economic growth looked solid at midyear and unemployment has been low. But job growth has lost momentum, and inflation has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, partly because of the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Jefferies' Simons expects the September employment report to show that employers added 65,000 jobs that month \u2014 unimpressive, but up from a meager 22,000 in August. He figures that unemployment remained at a low 4.3%.",
      "The data cutoff has caused consternation on Wall Street and deepened divisions among Fed officials over whether to cut interest rates for a third straight time at their next meeting in December.",
      "This week, some Fed policymakers have suggested that a lack of data is one reason they may support holding off on another rate cut.",

      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics will likely have enough data from businesses to calculate how many jobs were gained or lost last month. Much of that is submitted electronically. But a separate survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, didn\u2019t take place during the shutdown.",

      "In a quarterly report released Thursday, South Bow said initial findings show, \u201cthe failure resulted from a fatigue crack that originated along the pipe\u2019s manufactured long-seam weld.\u201d A fatigue crack develops from stress over time. A mechanical and metallurgical analysis found the pipe and welds met industry standards, the company said.",

    "story": [
      "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is planning to retire early next year and his successor has been named",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who turned America's largest retailer into a tech-powered giant and spearheaded a period of robust sales growth since becoming chief executive in 2014, plans to retire early next year, the company said Friday in a surprise announcement.",
      "John Furner, 51, the head of Walmart's U.S. operations, will take over on Feb. 1, the day after McMillon's retirement becomes effective, the company said. Although McMillon is set to spend a year advising his successor, Walmart shares fell 3% immediately in premarket trading after the news of the unexpected leadership change.",
      "Unlike Amazon's Jeff Bezos or Tesla's Elon Musk, McMillon isn't a household name, but he played a key role in the U.S. economy. Walmart's performance serves as a barometer of consumer spending given its size and vast customer base. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",
      "Walmart also is the nation's largest private employer, with 1.6 million workers.",
      "The pending CEO switch comes at a challenging time for retail companies and other employers that have spent almost 11 months navigating an uncertain economic environment as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration adopted volatile policies on tariffs and initiated an immigration crackdown that threatened to shrink the supply of workers.",
      "McMillon started with Walmart in 1984 and became chief executive three decades later. During his tenure as CEO, he invested heavily in employees by increasing wages, expanding parental leave and launching a program for employees seeking advancement and education opportunities to earn certificates and degrees.",
      "Under his leadership, Walmart has been laser-focused on maintaining low prices while embracing new technology like artificial intelligence and robotics.",
      "\u201cOver more than a decade as CEO, Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and e-commerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain,\" Walmart Chairman Greg Penner, the son-in-law of the late Walmart founder Sam Walton, said. \"He leaves Walmart stronger, more innovative, and better aligned with our purpose to help people save money and live better.\u201d",
      "Furner started at Walmart in 1993, working as an hourly store associate in Bentonville, Arkansas, where the company is based. He served as president and CEO of the U.S. division of Sam's Club, the membership warehouse-store chain that Walmart owns, before taking the same roles at Walmart U.S.",
      "Under McMillon, Walmart's annual revenue has grown from $485.7 billion to $681 billion in its latest fiscal year. Its stock was hovering around $25 per share when he came to the helm; now, it is over $102.",
      "When he became CEO, stores were messy and worker morale was low. McMillon thought the company needed to increase pay and create pathways for hourly workers to advance in their careers. In 2015, Walmart announced a three-year, $2.7 billion investment to increase wages and create new education and training opportunities.",

The company gradually regained investors' confidence with higher sales, new customers and greatly improved employee retention rates.",
      "Walmart also invested heavily in e-commerce and faster deliveries. The company said in August that roughly one-third of recent deliveries from its U.S. stores involved orders asking for goods to arrive in three hours or less, and 20% of those orders made it to customers in a half-hour or under.",
      "Walmart has also looked for new sources of revenue like advertising and launched a membership program called Walmart + to compete with Amazon Prime, its rival's free shipping program.",
      "During the coronavirus pandemic, Walmart powered through worldwide supply chain kinks and saw a sales surge as homebound consumers stocked up. Walmart used its clout with suppliers again to maintain low prices and attract more customers during the period of inflation that followed the pandemic.",
      "The company has said it is absorbing some of the extra import costs from Trump's tariffs on foreign goods but that customers would see some price increases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we said we would do,\u201d McMillon told stock analysts in August. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.\u201d",

      "When families are evicted, kids' schooling is often disrupted",
      "ATLANTA -- It was the worst summer in years. Sechita McNair\u2019s family took no vacations. Her younger boys didn\u2019t go to camp. Her van was repossessed, and her family nearly got evicted \u2014 again.",
      "But she accomplished the one thing she wanted most. A few weeks before school started, McNair, an out-of-work film industry veteran barely getting by driving for Uber, signed a lease in the right Atlanta neighborhood so her eldest son could stay at his high school.",
      "As she pulled up outside the school on the first day, Elias, 15, stepped onto the curb in his new basketball shoes and cargo pants. She inspected his face, noticed wax in his ears and grabbed a package of baby wipes from her rental car. She wasn\u2019t about to let her eldest, with his young Denzel Washington looks, go to school looking \u201cgross.\u201d",
      "He grimaced and broke away.",
      "\u201cNo kiss? No hugs?\u201d she called out.",
      "Elias waved and kept walking. Just ahead of him, at least for the moment, sat something his mother had fought relentlessly for: a better education.",
      "Last year, McNair and her three kids were evicted from their beloved apartment in the rapidly gentrifying Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Atlanta. Like many evicted families, they went from living in a school district that spends more money on students to one that spends less.",
      "Thanks to federal laws protecting homeless and evicted students, her kids were able to keep attending their Atlanta schools, even though the only housing available to them was in another county 40 minutes away. They also had the right to free transportation to those schools, but McNair says the district didn't tell her about that until the school year ended. Their eligibility to remain in those schools expired at the end of last school year.",
      "Still wounded by the death of his father and multiple housing displacements, Elias failed two classes last year, his freshman year. Switching schools now, McNair fears, would jeopardize any chance he has of recovering his academic life. \u201cI need this child to be stable,\u201d she says.",
      "With just one week before school started, McNair drove extra Uber hours, borrowed money, secured rental assistance and ignored concerns about the apartment to rent a three-bedroom in the Old Fourth Ward. At $2,200 a month, it was the only \u201csemi-affordable\u201d apartment in the rapidly gentrifying ward that would rent to a single mom with a fresh eviction on her record.",
      "On Zillow, the second-floor apartment, built in 2005, looked like a middle-class dream with its granite countertops, crown molding and polished wood floors. But up close, the apartment looked abused and held secrets McNair was only beginning to uncover.",
      "The first sign something was wrong came early. When she first toured the apartment, it felt rushed, like the agent didn\u2019t want her to look too closely. Then, even as they told her she was accepted, the landlord and real estate agent wouldn\u2019t send her a \u201cwelcome letter\u201d laying out the agreement, the rent and deposit she would pay. It seemed like they didn\u2019t want to put anything in writing.",
      "When the lease came, it was full of errors. She signed it anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the neighborhood!\u201d she said. Elias could return to Midtown High School.",
      "But even in their triumph, no one in the family could relax. Too many things were uncertain. And it fell to McNair \u2014 and only McNair \u2014 to figure it out.",
      "Midtown is a high school so coveted that school administrators investigate student residency throughout the year to keep out kids from other parts of Atlanta and beyond. For McNair, the day Elias returned to the high school was a momentous one.",
      "\u201cFreedom!\u201d McNair declared after Elias disappeared into the building. Without child care over the summer, McNair had struggled to find time to work enough to make ends meet. Now that the kids were back in class, McNair could spend school hours making money and resolving some of the unsettled issues with her new apartment.",
      "McNair, the first person in her family to attend college, studied theater management. Her job rigging stage sets was lucrative until the writers' and actors' strike and other changes paralyzed the film industry in 2023. The scarcity of work on movie sets, combined with her tendency to take in family and non-family alike, wrecked her home economy.",
      "The family was evicted last fall when McNair fell behind on rent because of funeral expenses for her foster daughter. The teen girl died from an epileptic seizure while McNair and everyone else slept. Elias found her body.",
      "McNair attributes some of Elias\u2019s lack of motivation at school to personal trauma. His father died after a heart attack in 2023, on the sidelines of Elias\u2019s basketball practice.",
      "On his first day back at school this August, Elias appeared excited but tentative. He watched as the seniors swanned into school wearing gold cardboard crowns, a Midtown back-to-school tradition, and scanned the sidewalk for anyone familiar.",
      "If Elias had his way, his mom would homeschool him. She\u2019s done it before. But now that he\u2019s a teenager, it\u2019s harder to get Elias to follow her instructions. As the only breadwinner supporting three kids and her disabled uncle, she has to work.",
      "Elias hid from the crowds and called up a friend: \u201cWhere you at?\u201d The friend, another sophomore, was still en route. Over the phone, they compared outfits, traded gossip about who got a new hairdo or transferred. When Elias\u2019s friend declared this would be the year he\u2019d get a girlfriend, Elias laughed.",
      "When it was time to go in, Elias drifted toward the door with his head down as other students flooded past.",
      "Hours later, he emerged. Despite everything McNair had done to help it go well \u2014 securing the apartment, even spending hundreds of dollars on new clothes for him \u2014 Elias slumped into the backseat when she picked him up after class.",
      "\u201cSchool was so boring,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d McNair asked.",
      "\u201cNothing, bro. That was the problem,\u201d Elias said. \u201cI thought I was going to be happy when school started, since summer was so horrible.\u201d",
      "Of all of the classes he was taking \u2014 geometry, gym, French, world history, environmental science \u2014 only gym interested him. He wished he could take art classes, he said. Elias has acted in some commercials and television programs, but chose a science and math concentration, hoping to study finance someday.",
      "After dinner at Chick-fil-A, the family visited the city library one block from their new apartment. While McNair spoke to the librarian, the boys explored the children\u2019s section. Malachi, 6, watched a YouTube video on a library computer while Derrick, 7, flipped through a book. Elias sat in a corner, sharing video gaming tips with a stranger he met online.",
      "\u201cThose people are learning Japanese,\u201d said McNair, pointing to a group of adults sitting around a cluster of tables. \u201cAnd this library lets you check out museum passes. This is why we have to be back in the city. Resources!\u201d",
      "McNair wants her children to go to well-resourced schools. Atlanta spends nearly $20,000 per student a year, $7,000 more than the district they moved to after the eviction. More money in schools means smaller classrooms and more psychologists, guidance counselors and other support.",
      "But McNair, who grew up in New Jersey near New York City, also sees opportunities in the wider city of Atlanta. She wants to use its libraries, e-scooters, bike paths, hospitals, rental assistance agencies, Buy Nothing groups and food pantries.",
      "\u201cThese are all resources that make it possible to raise a family when you don\u2019t have support,\" she said. \"Wouldn\u2019t anyone want that?\u201d",
      "On the way home, the little boys fall asleep in the back seat. Elias asks, \u201cSo, is homeschooling off the table?\u201d",

      "McNair doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cHeck yeah. I\u2019m not homeschooling you,\u201d she says lightly. \u201cDo you see how much of a financial bind I\u2019m in?\u201d\u2019",
      "McNair pulls into the driveway in Jonesboro, the suburb where the family landed after their eviction. Even though the family wants to live in Atlanta, their stuff is still here. It\u2019s a neighborhood of brick colonials and manicured lawns. She realizes it\u2019s the dream for some families, but not hers. \u201cIt\u2019s a support desert.\u201d",
      "As they get out of the car, Elias takes over as parent-in-charge. \u201cGet all of your things,\u201d he directs Malachi and Derrick, who scowl as Elias seems to relish bossing them around. \u201cPick up your car seats, your food, those markers. I don\u2019t want to see anything left behind.\u201d Elias would be responsible for making the boys burritos, showering them and putting them to sleep.",
      "McNair heads out to drive for Uber. That\u2019s what is necessary to pay $450 a week to rent the car and earn enough to pay her rent and bills.",
      "But while McNair is out, she can\u2019t monitor Elias. And a few days after he starts school, Elias\u2019s all-night gaming habit has already drawn teachers\u2019 attention.",
      "\u201cI wanted to check in regarding Elias,\u201d his geometry teacher writes during the first week of school. \u201cHe fell asleep multiple times during Geometry class this morning.\u201d",
      "Elias had told the teacher he went to bed around 4 a.m. the night before. \u201cI understand that there may be various reasons for this, and I\u2019d love to work together to support Elias so he can stay focused and successful in class.\u201d",
      "A few days later, McNair gets a similar email from his French teacher.",
      "That night, McNair drives around Atlanta, trying to pick up enough Uber trips to keep her account active. But she can\u2019t stop thinking about the emails. \u201cI should be home making sure Elias gets to bed on time,\u201d she says, crying. \u201cBut I have to work. I\u2019m the only one paying the bills.\u201d",
      "Ever since McNair rented the Atlanta apartment, her bills had doubled. She wasn't sure when she'd feel safe giving up the house she rents in Clayton County, given the problems with the Atlanta apartment. For starters, she was not even sure it was safe to spend the night there.",
      "A week after school started in August, McNair dropped by the apartment to check whether the landlords had made repairs. At the very least, she wanted more smoke detectors.",
      "She also wanted them to replace the door, which looked like someone had forced it open with a crowbar. She wanted a working fridge and oven. She wanted them to secure the back door to the adjoining empty apartment, which appeared to be open and made her wonder if there were pests or even people squatting there.",
      "But on this day, her keys didn\u2019t work.",
      "She called 911. Had her new landlords deliberately locked her out?",
      "When the police showed up outside the olive-green, Craftsman-style fourplex, McNair scrolled through her phone to find a copy of her lease. Then McNair and the officer eyed a man walking up to the property. \u201cThe building was sold in a short sale two weeks ago,\u201d he told McNair. The police officer directed the man to give the new keys to McNair.",
      "The next day, McNair started getting emails from an agent specializing in foreclosures, suggesting the new owners wanted McNair to leave. \u201cThe bank owns the property and now you are no longer a tenant of the previous owner,\u201d she wrote. The new owner \u201cmight\u201d offer relocation assistance if McNair agreed to leave.",
      "McNair consulted attorneys, who reassured her: It might be uncomfortable, but she could stay. She needed to try to pay rent, even if the new owner didn\u2019t accept it.",
      "So McNair messaged the agent, asking where she should send the rent, and requested the company make necessary repairs. Eventually, the real estate agent stopped responding.",
      "Finally, McNair moved her kids and a few items from the Jonesboro house to the Atlanta apartment. She didn\u2019t allow Elias to bring his video game console to Atlanta. He started going to bed around 11 p.m. most nights. But even as she solved that problem, others emerged.",
      "It was at Midtown\u2019s back-to-school night in September that McNair learned Elias was behind in most of his classes. Some teachers said maybe Midtown wasn't the right school for Elias.",
      "Perhaps they were right, McNair thought. She\u2019d heard similar things before.",
      "Elias also didn\u2019t want to go to school. He skipped one day, then another. McNair panicked. In Georgia, parents can be sent to jail for truancy when their kids miss five unexcused days.",
      "McNair started looking into a homeschooling program run by a mother she follows on Facebook. In the meantime, she emailed and called some Midtown staff for advice. She says she didn\u2019t get a response. Finally, seven weeks after the family\u2019s triumphant return to Midtown, McNair filed papers declaring her intention to homeschool Elias.",
      "It quickly proved challenging. Elias wouldn\u2019t do any schoolwork when he was home alone. And when the homeschooling group met twice a week, she discovered, they required parents to pick up their children afterward instead of allowing them to take public transit or e-scooters. That was untenable.",
      "Elias wanted to stay at home and offered to take care of McNair\u2019s uncle, who has dementia. \u201cThat was literally killing my soul the most,\u201d said McNair. \u201cThat\u2019s not a child\u2019s job.\u201d",
      "Hell, no, she told him \u2014 you only get one chance at high school.",
      "Then, one day, while she was loading the boys\u2019 clothes into the washing machine at the Atlanta apartment, she received a call from an unknown Atlanta number. It was the woman who heads Atlanta Public Schools\u2019 virtual program, telling her the roster was full.",
      "McNair asked the woman for her opinion on Elias\u2019s situation. Maybe she should abandon the Atlanta apartment and enroll him in the Jonesboro high school.",
      "Let me stop you right there, the woman said. Is your son an athlete? If he transfers too many times, it can affect his ability to play basketball. And he\u2019d probably lose credits and take longer to graduate. He needs to be in school \u2014 preferably Midtown \u2014 studying for midterms, she said. You need to put on your \u201cbig mama drawers\u201d and take him back, she told McNair.",
      "The next day, Elias and his mother pulled up to Midtown. Outside the school, Elias asked if he had to go inside. Yes, she told him. This is your fault as much as it\u2019s mine.",
      "Now, with Elias back in school every day, McNair can deliver food through Uber Eats without worrying about a police officer asking why her kid isn\u2019t in school. If only she had pushed harder, sooner, for help with Elias, she thought. \u201cI should have just gone down to the school and sat in their offices until they talked to me.\"",
      "But it was easy for her to explain why she hadn\u2019t. \u201cI was running around doing so many other things just so we have a place to live, or taking care of my uncle, that I didn\u2019t put enough of my energy there.\u201d",
      "She wishes she could pay more attention to Elias. But so many things are pulling at her. And as fall marches toward winter, her struggle continues. After failing to keep up with the Jonesboro rent, she's preparing to leave that house before the landlord sends people to haul her possessions to the curb.",
      "As an Uber driver, she has picked up a few traumatized mothers with their children after they got evicted. She helped them load the few things they could fit into her van. As they drove off, onlookers scavenged the leftovers.",
      "She has promised herself she\u2019d never let that happen to her kids.",

    "story": [
      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",
      "A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.",
      "\u201cThe natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\u201d Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.",
      "A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.",
      "Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.",

      "The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.",
      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",
      "There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.",
      "Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.",
      "And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.",
      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.",
      "One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder.",
      "\u201cTell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can\u2019t do anything with it,\u201d asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.",
      "Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.",

      "Rice farmer Hwang Seong-yeol and four other South Korean growers have sued the state utility Korea Electric Power Corp. and its power-generating subsidiaries, alleging their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels has accelerated climate change and dam...",
      "SEOSAN, South Korea -- Hwang Seong-yeol stood at the edge of a golden field, watching nervously as a combine harvester crawled through his rice, churning up mud and stalks. Its steady hum filled the damp autumn air as grain poured into a truck waiting at the other end of the muddy paddy.",
      "It was the final day of what Hwang said was one of his toughest seasons in three decades of farming. He and other farmers feel helpless against increasingly erratic weather that they link to climate change and damage to their crops. It has complicated their work and cast uncertainty over their futures.",
      "Hwang is one of five South Korean farmers who recently sued the state utility Korea Electric Power Corporation and its power-generating subsidiaries, alleging that their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels has accelerated climate change and damaged their crops.",
      "The lawsuit raises questions about whether power companies\u2019 role in driving climate change, and the resulting agricultural losses, can be quantified. It is the first of its kind in South Korea, said Yeny Kim, a lawyer with the Seoul-based nonprofit Solutions for Our Climate, who is handling the case.",
      "The case underscores the challenges South Korea, a manufacturing power that industrialized long after the Western nations now pressuring others to abandon fossil fuels, faces in transitioning to cleaner energy.",
      "Hwang's fields are on a reclaimed coastal plain along South Korea\u2019s western sea, where glimmering waterways crisscross dark, rich soil and flocks of migratory geese drift overhead, moving like a giant, living quilt.",
      "A remarkably rainy September and October followed a bitterly cold spring that stunted plant growth. Summer floods caused further damage before the wet autumn bred fungal disease.",
      "Hwang would have preferred to harvest in drier weather but had to do so sooner as relentless rains pushed rice stalks into the soil, causing the ripe grains to sprout. That day in late October was only the second dry day after 18 straight days of rain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really unsettling \u2013 we know how much rice we should normally get from 30,000 pyeong (25 acres) of land, but the yield has been steadily declining every year,\u201d said Hwang, who expects this year\u2019s harvest to be 20% to 25% below normal.",
      "\u201cWe began to question why it\u2019s always the farmers \u2014 who haven\u2019t done anything wrong \u2014 that end up suffering the consequences of the climate crisis. Shouldn\u2019t we be demanding something from those who are actually causing it?\u201d",
      "Farmers are \u201cinherently vulnerable\" to climate change, said Kim, the lawyer.",
      "In an annual climate report in April, South Korea\u2019s government detailed how a year of extreme weather events in 2024, the country\u2019s hottest year ever, triggered a series of \u201cagricultural disasters\u201d of heavy summer rains that destroyed thousands of hectares (acres) of cropland, followed by weeks of intense heat that wrecked still more crops, mostly rice.",

      "From 2011-2022, the companies produced about 30% of South Korea\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and roughly 0.4% of global emissions, based on Kim's analysis of publicly available data.",
      "\u201cTherefore, they should also bear 0.4% of the responsibility for the farmers\u2019 losses,\u201d Kim said.",

      "A confidant of Bill Pulte, the Trump administration\u2019s top housing regulator, provided confidential mortgage pricing data from Fannie Mae to a principal competitor",
      "WASHINGTON -- A confidant of Bill Pulte, the Trump administration's top housing regulator, provided confidential mortgage pricing data from Fannie Mae to a principal competitor, alarming senior officials of the government-backed lending giant who warned it could expose the company to claims that it was colluding with a rival to fix mortgage rates.",
      "Emails reviewed by The Associated Press show that Fannie Mae executives were unnerved about what one called the \u201cvery problematic\u201d disclosure of data by Lauren Smith, the company's head of marketing, who was acting on Pulte\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cLauren, the information that was provided to Freddie Mac in this email is a problem,\u201d Malloy Evans, senior vice president of Fannie Mae\u2019s single-family mortgage division, wrote in an Oct. 11 email. \u201cThat is confidential, competitive information.\u201d",
      "He also copied Fannie Mae\u2019s CEO, Priscilla Almodovar, on the email, which bore the subject line: \u201cAs Per Director Pulte\u2019s Ask.\u201d Evans asked Fannie Mae's top attorney \u201cto weigh in on what, if any, steps we need to take legally to protect ourselves now.\u201d",
      "While Smith still holds her position, the senior Fannie Mae officials who called her conduct into question were all forced out of their jobs late last month, along with internal ethics watchdogs who were investigating Pulte and his allies.",
      "The dismissals rattled the housing industry and drew condemnation from Democrats. It also gave Pulte's critics evidence to support claims that he has leveraged the nonpublic information available to him to further his own political aims.",
      "\u201cThis is another example of Bill Pulte weaponizing his role to do Donald Trump\u2019s bidding, instead of working to lower costs amidst a housing crisis,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cHis behavior raises significant questions, and he needs to be brought in front of Congress to answer them.\u201d",
      "The episode marks the latest example of Pulte using what is typically a low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy to enhance his own standing and gain the attention of President Trump. He's prompted mortgage fraud investigations of prominent Democrats who are some of the president\u2019s best known antagonists, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California, New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Rep. Eric Swalwell.",
      "In June, he ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal for the firms to accept cryptocurrency, another industry Trump has boosted, as part of the criteria for buying mortgages from banks. Last week, he persuaded Trump about the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building \u2014 a proposal that was widely criticized because it would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.",
      "Pulte also has focused on large home construction companies, which have drawn Trump's ire. Pulte requested confidential Fannie Mae data and has publicly signaled that he is considering a crackdown if the companies do not increase construction volume.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking at the Fannie Mae builder data and with the top three homebuilders we buy EASILY over $20 billion in THEIR LOANS!\u201d he posted to X in early October.",
      "In a brief statement, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which Pulte leads, did not address questions from the AP, but said the agency \u201crequires its regulated entities to carry out their operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Fannie Mae said it takes \u201ccompliance with the law very seriously and we have a rigorous program to ensure we follow all laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Pulte and Smith did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Since his appointment to lead the FHFA, Pulte has sought to ingratiate himself with Trump. The 37-year-old scion of a homebuilding company fortune, Pulte has cultivated a reputation as a hyper-online millennial with a thirst for recognition and a desire to please the president. He and his wife also donated about $1 million to Trump's campaign, campaign finance disclosures show.",

      "The Trump administration says it is rescinding federal rules that were aimed at protecting vast swaths of a petroleum reserve in Alaska that provide key habitat for migrating birds, caribou and other wildlife",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Trump administration said Thursday it is rescinding federal rules that were aimed at protecting from future oil and gas leasing vast swaths of a petroleum reserve in Alaska that provide key habitat for migrating birds, caribou and other wildlife.",
      "The U.S. Interior Department said the final rule would be published next week but announced it is repealing rules put in place last year. Those rules restricted future leasing and industrial development in areas within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska designated as special for wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "Thursday's announcement is in line with an Alaska-specific executive order President Donald Trump signed upon his return to office. The order sought to unravel policies put in place by his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, that state political leaders complained had limited Alaska\u2019s ability to develop its vast energy resources, including oil and gas.",
      "The Biden-era rules also had called for the Interior Department to evaluate regularly whether to designate new special areas or to boost protections in those areas. They cited rapidly changing conditions in the Arctic \u2014 such as melting permafrost and changes in plant life and wildlife corridors \u2014 due to climate change. The agency under Biden said the rules would not affect existing leases or operations, including the large Willow oil project, but would \u201craise the bar\u201d for future development.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June said the Biden-era rules were at odds with a leasing program mandate for the petroleum reserve and prioritized \u201cobstruction over production.\u201d",
      "There has been longstanding debate over where oil and gas should be developed within the reserve.

      "Federal workers are returning to \u201ca mountain of work\u201d that will take time to process, Haimowitz said. That doesn\u2019t just include sending out missed grant awards \u2014 other paperwork for a range of technical issues has been delayed since layoffs at the Office of Head Start earlier this year, she said.",
      "\u201cThose delays have just been piling up since April, with no fault to the existing civil servants at the Office of Head Start,\u201d Haimowitz said. \u201cThey just have half the capacity that they had just a few months ago.\u201d",
      "Depending on how quickly federal workers can send out funds, the backlog in grant renewals could spill over and affect Head Start agencies that are supposed to receive funding in December, operators said.

      "Several thousand Boeing machinists in the Midwest who assemble military aircraft and weapons voted Thursday to approve a new contract, ending a three-month strike that saw them reject four earlier offers from the company.",
      "The breakthrough five-year labor agreement includes a 24% wage hike across the life of the contract and a $6,000 signing bonus, according to the union representing the 3,200 workers who walked off the job on Aug. 4.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what our members have fought for together and are ready to get back to building the world\u2019s most advanced military aircraft,\" the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said in a statement.",
      "With their new contract in hand, the machinists are set to return to work Sunday at manufacturing plants in the Missouri cities of St. Louis and St. Charles, as well as in Mascoutah, Illinois. The workers build fighter jets, weapons systems and the U.S. Navy\u2019s first carrier-based unmanned aircraft at those facilities.",

      "Tensions rose long before the strike, with the workers rejecting a proposed 20% raise over the contract's term and $5,000 ratification bonuses. Boeing responded with an offer that kept the same pay increases but dropped a scheduling rule that limited overtime opportunities. Workers turned that down as well and went on strike the next morning, later rejecting two other company offers.",

      "No. 9 Notre Dame extended its winning streak to eight with a decisive 37-15 win over No. 23 Pittsburgh",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Jeremiyah Love ran for 147 yards and a score, Malachi Fields hauled in a pair of touchdown passes and No. 9 Notre Dame breezed past No. 23 Pittsburgh 37-15 on Saturday.",
      "The Fighting Irish (8-2) have won eight straight games by an average of 26 points since their 0-2 start. Notre Dame likely needs to merely avoid upset bids by Syracuse or Stanford to end the season to secure a spot in the College Football Playoff.",
      "Love gave his burgeoning Heisman Trophy campaign a boost by finishing with 167 yards of total offense, the highlight coming on a 56-yard sprint to the end zone in the first quarter that included a spin move at midfield that left Pitt's Kavir Bains-Marquez grasping at air.",
      "Notre Dame's Tae Johnson picked off Heintschel on the next play from scrimmage and raced 48 yards to the end zone to give the Irish an early 14-point lead they never squandered.",
      "C.J. Carr threw for 212 yards with two interceptions and touchdown passes of 25 and 6 yards to Fields. The 6-foot-4 Fields made a leaping grab at the goal line to secure the first score late in the first half, then effectively put the game out of reach early in the second half by barrelling into the end zone against a game but ineffective Pitt defense that was physically overmatched at times.",
      "It was much the same on the other side of the ball, as Notre Dame kept Panthers true freshman quarterback Mason Heintschel in check.",
      "Pitt's rise to near the top of the ACC standings began when Heintschel supplanted Eli Holstein to start October. Heintschel's impressive start hit its first significant speed bump against an Irish defense that gave him little time or space to work.",
      "Heintschel completed just 16 of 33 passes for 126 yards with an interception while getting sacked four times. He had a 2-point conversion attempt late in the third quarter returned 100-plus yards the other way by Irish safety Adon Shuler to put Notre Dame up 30-9 and end any remote chance of a comeback after a pick-6 by Pitt's Rasheem Biles had briefly given the Panthers a jolt.",

      "Notre Dame: The Irish seem to be getting better with each passing week. Save for some questionable play-calling \u2014 Notre Dame turned it over on downs at the Pitt 1 in the first half when the Irish opted to have Carr pass rather than hand the ball to the best running back in the country \u2014 this one was never in doubt, just like most of Notre Dame's previous seven victories. The Irish will hold steady at worst and could tick up a spot or two in the polls depending on what happens elsewhere in the country.",
      "Pitt: The Panthers still have a shot at reaching the ACC title game if they can beat No. 14 Georgia Tech and No. 16 Miami to end the regular season. Still, they were decidedly outclassed by the Irish, who outgained the Panthers 387-219 and bullied Pitt in a way it hasn't been bullied this year. Pitt\u2019s appearance in the AP Top 25 and the CFP rankings figures to be a cameo, though the Panthers will have multiple chances to earn their way back in over the next two weeks.",

      "Mendoza spent some time in the injury tent during the fourth quarter, but returned on the next Indiana series to throw his school-record-breaking 30th TD of the season \u2014 a 5-yarder to Omar Cooper Jr. Mendoza continued to make his Heisman Trophy case by going 22 of 24 despite being sacked five times.",

      "Indiana took control by closing the first half with a 37-yard field goal to make it 10-7 and opening the second half with a 2-yard TD pass from Mendoza to Holden Staes. The Hoosiers then converted a Badgers turnover into a 21-yard TD pass from Mendoza to Riley Nowakowski, the former Badger. Mendoza and Cooper closed it out with a fourth quarter scoring play for the second straight week.",
      "Wisconsin running back Gideon Ituka left the game on a cart, strapped to a backboard midway through the third quarter after taking two big hits on the same and then hitting his head hard on the playing surface. He gave a thumbs-up signal on his way off. The Badgers did not have an immediate update on Ituka's condition.",

His intimidating nature and athletic grace made him one of the best players of all time.\u201d",

      "However, Easley's departure from the Seahawks was marred by controversy. He was traded after the 1987 season, in part because of a kidney ailment that shortened his NFL career. He was traded to the Cardinals and failed his physical. He never played another down and believed the large doses of painkillers he took as a player led to his kidney issues.",

      "Cities and states in the U.S. are turning to AI to improve road safety",

The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",
      "\u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they\u2019re going to put their vans,\u201d said Richard Browning, chief commercial officer at Nextbase, which developed the dashcams and imagery platform for Hawaii.",
      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",

      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",

      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.",

      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A team of researchers has uncovered what they say is the first reported use of artificial intelligence to direct a hacking campaign in a largely automated fashion.",
      "The AI company Anthropic said this week that it disrupted a cyber operation that its researchers linked to the Chinese government. The operation involved the use of an artificial intelligence system to direct the hacking campaigns, which researchers called a disturbing development that could greatly expand the reach of AI-equipped hackers.",

      "The operation was modest in scope and only targeted about 30 individuals who worked at tech companies, financial institutions, chemical companies and government agencies. Anthropic noticed the operation in September and took steps to shut it down and notify the affected parties.",
      "The hackers only \u201csucceeded in a small number of cases,\u201d according to Anthropic, which noted that while AI systems are increasingly being used in a variety of settings for work and leisure, they can also be weaponized by hacking groups working for foreign adversaries.

      "Blue Origin has launched its huge New Glenn rocket with a pair of NASA spacecraft destined for Mars",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Blue Origin launched its huge New Glenn rocket Thursday with a pair of NASA spacecraft destined for Mars.",
      "It was only the second flight of the rocket that Jeff Bezos\u2019 company and NASA are counting on to get people and supplies to the moon \u2014 and it was a complete success.",
      "The 321-foot (98-meter) New Glenn blasted into the afternoon sky from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending NASA\u2019s twin Mars orbiters on a drawn-out journey to the red planet. Liftoff was stalled four days by lousy local weather as well as solar storms strong enough to paint the skies with auroras as far south as Florida.",
      "In a remarkable first, Blue Origin recovered the booster following its separation from the upper stage and the Mars orbiters, an essential step to recycle and slash costs similar to SpaceX. Company employees cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on a barge 375 miles (600 kilometers) offshore. An ecstatic Bezos watched the action from Launch Control.",
      "\u201cNext stop, moon!\u201d employees chanted following the booster's bull's-eye landing. Twenty minutes later, the rocket's upper stage deployed the two Mars orbiters in space, the mission's main objective. Congratulations poured in from NASA officials as well as SpaceX's Elon Musk, whose booster landings are now routine.",
      "New Glenn\u2019s inaugural test flight in January delivered a prototype satellite to orbit, but failed to land the booster on its floating platform in the Atlantic.",
      "The identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, will spend a year hanging out near Earth, stationing themselves 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away. Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027.",
      "Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty. Scientists will also learn how best to protect astronauts against Mars' harsh radiation environment.",
      "\u201cWe really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\u201d Escapade\u2019s lead scientist, Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, said ahead of the launch. \u201cEscapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we\u2019re going to have two spacecraft at the same time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a relatively low-budget mission, coming in under $80 million, that's managed and operated by UC Berkeley. NASA saved money by signing up for one of New Glenn\u2019s early flights. The Mars orbiters should have blasted off last fall, but NASA passed up that ideal launch window \u2014 Earth and Mars line up for a quick transit just every two years \u2014 because of feared delays with Blue Origin's brand-new rocket.",
      "Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the world, New Glenn is five times bigger than the New Shepard rockets sending wealthy clients to the edge of space from West Texas. Blue Origin plans to launch a prototype Blue Moon lunar lander on a demo mission in the coming months aboard New Glenn.",

      "Several lawsuits emerged across the U.S. \u2014 and were later consolidated \u2014 after AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. Plaintiffs alleged that the telecommunications giant \u201crepeatedly failed\u201d to protect consumer data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation,\u201d AT&T said in a Thursday statement, adding that the company remains \"committed to protecting our customers\u2019 data and ensuring their continued trust in us.\u201d",

      "AT&T disclosed the first of these breaches in March 2024, after the company said it found that customer information from 2019 or earlier had been released on the \u201cdark web\" weeks earlier. At the time, AT&T said the breach impacted roughly 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former account holders \u2014 with leaked data including some sensitive info like Social Security numbers and passcodes.",
      "The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was \u201cillegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform\u201d in April of last year \u2014 and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation. The company maintained that the leaked records included information like phone numbers, but not content of the calls or texts, or other personally identifiable information.",

      "There's a new frontier in treating autoimmune diseases",
      "Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 by reprogramming patients\u2019 out-of-whack immune systems.",
      "When your body\u2019s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today\u2019s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don\u2019t fix what\u2019s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects \u2014 and too often the drugs aren\u2019t enough to keep their disease in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who\u2019s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer \u201cthe chance to control disease in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.",
      "They\u2019re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who\u2019ve exhausted today\u2019s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.",
      "\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with my body?\u201d Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.",
      "Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn\u2019t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital\u2019s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.",
      "Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.",
      "\u201cI can actually run, I can chase my kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. \u201cI had forgotten what it was to be me.\u201d",
      "CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas \u2014 immune cells called B cells \u2014 go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.",
      "Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she\u2019s been in remission \u2014 with no other medicine \u2014 since March 2021.",
      "Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma \u2014 and few relapses so far.",
      "Those early results were \u201cshocking,\u201d Hopkins\u2019 Konig recalled.",
      "They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.",
      "How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient\u2019s blood and sent to a lab, where they\u2019re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those \u201cliving drugs\u201d are infused back into the patient.",
      "While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can\u2019t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they\u2019re healthy.",
      "CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.",
      "Another approach uses \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cells at the center of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.",
      "Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don\u2019t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body's existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen's Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.",

      "Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins\u2019 Konig aims to get more precise, targeting \u201conly that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.\u201d",
      "B cells have identifiers, like biological barcodes, showing they can produce faulty antibodies, Konig said. Researchers in his lab are trying to engineer T cell engagers that would only mark \u201cbad\u201d B cells for destruction, leaving healthy ones in place to fight infection.",
      "Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "In Green's lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It\u2019s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells \u2014 and they're outnumbered.",
      "Green's team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune \u201cgenerals\u201d to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they'd \u201cdivide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,\" Green said.",

      "A drug for Type 1 diabetes \u201cis forging the path,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Deane at the University of Colorado Anshutz.",
      "Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, and blood tests can spot people who are brewing it. A course of the drug teplizumab is approved to delay the first symptoms, modulating rogue T cells and prolonging insulin production.",
      "Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.",
      "About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.",
      "Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he\u2019s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.",
      "On all these fronts, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of research left to do \u2014 and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T's safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.",
      "Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma \u2014 and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.",
      "\u201cI just remember I woke up one day and thought, \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t feel sick anymore,\u2019\u201d she said.",

      "The White House's list of 37 donors to President Donald Trump's $300 million ballroom project includes crypto billionaires, powerful financiers, tobacco companies, tech giants, media companies, longtime Republican donors and several of the president\u2019s ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says his $300 million White House ballroom will be paid for \u201c100% by me and some friends of mine.\u201d",
      "The White House released a list of 37 donors, including crypto billionaires, charitable organizations, sports team owners, powerful financiers, tech and tobacco giants, media companies, longtime supporters of Republican causes and several of the president's neighbors in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "It's incomplete. Among others, the list doesn't include Carrier Group, which offered to donate an HVAC system for the ballroom, and artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, whose CEO, Jensen Huang, publicly discussed its donation.",
      "The White House hasn't said how much each donor is giving, and almost none was willing to divulge that. Very few commented on their contributions when contacted by The Associated Press.",
      "A senior White House official said the list has grown since it was first released in October, but some companies don't want to be publicly named until required to do so by financial disclosure regulations. No foreign individuals or entities were among the donors, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.",
      "Here's a look at the divulged donors:",
      "Amazon Background: Trump was once highly critical of company founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, but has been much less so lately.

Its cloud-based computing operation, Amazon Web Services, is a major government contractor.",
      "Apple Background: After an up-and-down relationship during Trump's first term, CEO Tim Cook has sought to improve his standing with the president this time. Before returning to the White House, Trump hosted Cook at his Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago, and said he had spoken with Cook about the company\u2019s long-running tax battles with the European Union. Cook also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. In the spring, Trump threatened the computing giant with tariffs after Apple announced plans to build manufacturing facilities in India. In August, Cook presented the president with a customized glass plaque with a gold base as the CEO announced plans to bring Apple's total investment commitment in U.S. manufacturing over four years to $600 billion.",
      "Google Background: During his first term, Trump\u2019s administration sued Google for antitrust violations. While a candidate last year, Trump suggested he might seek to break up the search engine behemoth. Once Trump won the election, Google donated $1 million to his inauguration, and its CEO, Sundar Pichai, joined other major tech executives in attending the ceremony. Google's subsidiary, YouTube, agreed in September to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump after it suspended his account following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. According to court filings, $22 million of that went to the Trust for the National Mall, which can help pay for ballroom construction.",
      "HP Background: An original Silicon Valley stalwart, the company donated to Trump's inaugural fund. HP 's CEO, Enrique Lores, participated in a White House roundtable event in September.

But at least $120 billion of that involved holdovers first announced during Biden's administration.",
      "Microsoft Background: The company donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, twice what it spent for Biden's or for Trump's first inauguration. CEO Satya Nadella has also met with Trump numerous times, as Microsoft has supported the administration\u2019s relaxation of regulations on artificial intelligence. He met previously with Biden, too. Trump has called for Microsoft's president of global affairs, Lisa Monaco, to be fired because she was a deputy attorney general under Biden when the Justice Department led several investigations against Trump.",

      "NextEra Energy Background: NextEra is the world\u2019s largest electric utility holding company. Trump says he'll work to ensure tech giants can secure their own sources of electricity to power data centers, especially as they expand energy-hogging artificial intelligence operations.

      "\u201cWhen you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It\u2019s a coping mechanism,\u201d said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.",

      "\u201cWhen we can research, develop and manufacture vaccines locally, we reduce our vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, international market competition and vaccine nationalism, which was apparent at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Motsoaledi.",
      "The trials are being held in the provinces of Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, where cholera cases have previously been reported.",

      "The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China\u2019s widening effort to catch up with the U.S. in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology.

      "Unemployment among Chinese graduates remains high, and competition is intense for jobs in scientific and technical fields. But there is a skills gap China's leadership is eager to fill. For decades, China has been losing top talent to developed countries as many stayed and worked in the U.S. and Europe after they finished studies there.",

      "The Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others is now in the hands of a new prosecutor",
      "ATLANTA -- The fate of the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others is now in the hands of a new prosecutor who has to decide how he is going to move forward with the sprawling indictment.",
      "After courts removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had chosen to lead the case, it was up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council to someone to take over. Council Executive Director Pete Skandalakis said Friday that he would handle the case himself after he was unable to find anyone else willing to do it.",
      "The indictment against Trump and 18 others was returned by a grand jury in August 2023 and uses the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to allege a wide-ranging conspiracy to illegally overturn Trump\u2019s narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.",
      "Here are some things to know about Skandalakis and what might come next for this prosecution.",
      "When a prosecutor recuses or is removed from a case in Georgia, the executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys' Council steps in to appoint a substitute prosecutor. Skandalakis, who has led the agency since January 2018, said in an e-mailed statement that he contacted several prosecutors about taking over the election interference case and they all declined.",
      "The judge overseeing the case had said that if a new prosecutor wasn't appointed by Friday, he would dismiss the case. Skandalakis said that while he could easily have let the judge's deadline pass without appointing anyone and allowed the case to be dismissed, he \u201cdid not believe that to be the right course of action.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that he had not had a chance to fully review the case, having only recently received from Willis' office 101 boxes of documents and an eight-terabyte hard drive with the full investigative file. Appointing himself to the case, he said, \u201cwill allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed.\u201d",
      "Prior to his time at the council, Skandalakis spent about 25 years as the elected Republican district attorney for the Coweta Judicial Circuit, southwest of Atlanta. But former Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter, who has known Skandalakis for more than 40 years, said they shared a philosophy that the district attorney's office should be nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the fact that he ran as a Republican,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI feel certain that he\u2019s going to do what he said he\u2019s going to do and give it a fair and transparent review and come to conclusions based on the law and the facts.\u201d",
      "Skandalakis is no stranger to sensitive high-profile cases. He took on the investigation into the June 2020 shooting death of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, by a white police officer after Willis recused her office from the case. He ultimately decided that the two officers involved had acted reasonably, and he declined to pursue charges.",
      "Skandalakis will continue to review the case file to decide how he wants to proceed. The judge has set a Dec. 1 status hearing and said the prosecution should be prepared to say at that time whether it intends to seek a new indictment in the case.",

      "Skandalakis has declined to comment beyond the statement he released Friday. But Porter, who has served as a substitute prosecutor, said the first step is generally to get the case filed, which Skandalakis has done. Then, Porter said, it is not improper to have a discussion with the removed prosecutor about their summary of the case, but that should be the last contact between the two prosecution teams about the case.",
      "Then the substitute prosecutor would start from scratch, figuring out how the case is organized, determining the budget and resources needed to handle it and figuring out how to handle it.",
      "The size of this case makes all that a \u201cnearly impossible task for one person to do,\u201d Porter said. While Skandalakis has a \u201cgreat staff\u201d with some really talented prosecutors, they all have other cases on their plates.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council has a tight budget, and the state legislature is dominated by Republicans, many loyal to Trump, who are unlikely to grant any special appropriations for this prosecution. But Skandalakis could look for money elsewhere to hire contract attorneys and cover other expenses, Porter said.",
      "Then Skandalakis will have to decide whether he wants to continue on the course that Willis had charted, pursue only some of the charges or dismiss the case.",
      "\u201cI think the case as it's indicted is completely untryable,\u201d Porter said, adding that he would try to slim it down, either by seeking a new indictment or asking the judge to sever some counts to break it down into smaller cases, Porter said.",
      "The indictment includes charges related to a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger during which Trump urged the state\u2019s top elections official to help him \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to win. Other charges have to do with a getting a slate of Republican electors to falsely declare that Trump won the state, allegations of harassment of a Georgia election worker and a breach of election equipment in a rural south Georgia county.",
      "Four of the 19 people charged pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors in the months following their indictment. Trump and the other 14 people charged have all pleaded not guilty. It seems unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he is in office, but the others do not have that shield.",

      "An immersion program that helps preserve an Alaska Native language has been a boon to children displaced by last month's severe flooding in western Alaska",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Rayann Martin sat in a classroom hundreds of miles from her devastated Alaska Native village and held up 10 fingers when the teacher asked the pupils how old they were.",
      "\u201cTen \u2014 how do you say 10 in Yup'ik?\u201d the teacher asked.",
      "\u201cQula!\u201d the students answered in unison.",
      "Martin and her family were among hundreds of people airlifted to Anchorage, the state's largest city, after the remnants of Typhoon Halong inundated their small coastal villages along the Bering Sea last month, dislodging dozens of homes and floating them away \u2014 many with people inside. The floods left nearly 700 homes destroyed or heavily damaged. One person died, two remain missing.",
      "As the residents grapple with uprooted lives very different from the traditional ones they left, some of the children are finding a measure of familiarity in a school-based immersion program that focuses on their Yup\u2019ik language and culture \u2014 one of two such programs in the state.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m learning more Yup\u2019ik,\u201d said Martin, who added that she's using the language to communicate with her mother, teachers and classmates. \u201cI usually speak more Yup\u2019ik in villages, but mostly more English in cities.\u201d",
      "There are more than 100 languages spoken in the homes of Anchorage School District students. Yup\u2019ik, which is spoken by about 10,000 people in the state, is the fifth most common. The district adopted its first language immersion program \u2014 Japanese \u2014 in 1989, and subsequently added Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, German, French and Russian.",
      "After many requests from parents, the district obtained a federal grant and added a K-12 Yup'ik immersion program about nine years ago. The students in the first class are now eighth-graders. The program is based at College Gate Elementary and Wendler Middle School.",
      "The principal at College Gate Elementary, Darrell Berntsen, is himself Alaska Native \u2014 Sugpiaq, from Kodiak Island, south of Anchorage. His mother was 12 years old in 1964 when the magnitude-9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake and an ensuing tsunami devastated her village of Old Harbor. He recalls her stories of joining other villagers at high ground and watching as the surge of water carried homes out to sea.",
      "His mother and her family evacuated to a shelter in Anchorage, but returned to Kodiak Island when Old Harbor was rebuilt. Berntsen grew up living a subsistence life \u2014 \u201cthe greatest time of my life was being able to go out duck hunting, go out deer hunting,\" he said \u2014 and he understands what the evacuees from Kipnuk, Kwigillingok and other damaged villages have left behind.",
      "He has also long had an interest in preserving Alaska Native culture and languages. His ex-wife\u2019s grandmother, Marie Smith Jones, was the last fluent speaker of Eyak, an indigenous language from south-central Alaska, when she died in 2008. His uncles had their hands slapped when they spoke their indigenous Alutiiq language at school.",
      "As the evacuees arrived in Anchorage in the days after last month's flooding, Berntsen greeted them at an arena where the Red Cross had set up a shelter. He invited families to enroll their children in the Yup'ik immersion program. Many of the parents showed him photos of the duck, goose, moose, seal or other traditional foods they had saved for the winter \u2014 stockpiles that washed away or spoiled in the flood.",
      "\u201cListening is a big part of our culture \u2014 hearing their stories, letting them know that, \u2018Hey, I live here in Anchorage, I\u2019m running one of my schools, the Yup\u2019ik immersion program, you guys are welcome at our school,\u2019\u201d Berntsen said. \"Do everything we can to make them feel comfortable in the most uncomfortable situation that they\u2019ve ever been through.\u201d",

      "At College Gate, pupils receive instruction in Yup\u2019ik for half the day, including Yup\u2019ik literacy and language as well as science and social studies. The other half is in English, which includes language arts and math classes.",
      "Among the program's new students is Ellyne Aliralria, a 10-year-old from Kipnuk. During the surge of floodwater the weekend of Oct. 11, she and her family were in a home that floated upriver. The high water also washed away her sister's grave, she said.",
      "Aliralria likes the immersion program and learning more phrases, even though the Yup\u2019ik dialect being spoken is a bit different from the one she knows.",
      "\u201cI like to do all of them, but some of them are hard,\u201d the fifth-grader said.",
      "Also difficult is adjusting to living in a motel room in a city nearly 500 miles (800 km) from their village on the southwest coast.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re homesick,\u201d she said.",
      "Lilly Loewen, 10, is one of many non-Yup'iks in the program. She said her parents wanted her to participate because \"they thought it was really cool.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is just really amazing to get to talk to people in another language other than just what I speak mostly at home,\u201d Loewen said.",
      "Berntsen is planning to help the new students acclimate by holding activities such as gym nights or Olympic-style events, featuring activities that mimic Alaska Native hunting and fishing techniques. One example: the seal hop, in which participants assume a plank position and shuffle across the floor to emulate how hunters sneak up on seals napping on the ice.",
      "The Yup'ik immersion program is helping undo some of the damage Western culture did to Alaska Native language and traditions, he said. It's also bridging the gap of two lost generations: In some cases, the children's parents or grandparents never learned Yup'ik, but the students can now speak with their great-grandparents, Locke said.",
      "\u201cI took this as a great opportunity for us to give back some of what the trauma had taken from our Indigenous people,\u201d Berntsen said.",

      "As President Donald Trump reshapes immigration and the nation\u2019s relationship with immigrants, some naturalized citizens are wondering if the country they made a commitment to when they took the oath of citizenship is still making one to them",
      "NEW YORK -- When he first came to the United States after escaping civil war in Sierra Leone and spending almost a decade in a refugee camp, Dauda Sesay had no idea he could become a citizen. But he was told that if he followed the rules and stayed out of trouble, after some years he could apply. As a U.S. citizen, he would have protection.",
      "It\u2019s what made him decide to apply: the premise \u2014 and the promise \u2014 that when he became a naturalized American citizen, it would create a bond between him and his new home. He would have rights as well as responsibilities, like voting, that, as he was making a commitment to the country, the country was making one to him.",
      "\u201cWhen I raised my hand and took the oath of allegiance, I did believe that moment the promise that I belonged,\u201d said Sesay, 44, who first arrived in Louisiana more than 15 years ago and now works as an advocate for refugees and their integration into American society.",
      "But in recent months, as President Donald Trump reshapes immigration and the country's relationship with immigrants, that belief has been shaken for Sesay and other naturalized citizens. There's now fear that the push to drastically increase deportations and shift who can claim America as home, through things like trying to end birthright citizenship, is having a ripple effect.",
      "What they thought was the bedrock protection of naturalization now feels more like quicksand.",
      "Some are worried that if they leave the country, they will have difficulties when trying to return, fearful because of accounts of naturalized citizens being questioned or detained by U.S. border agents. They wonder: Do they need to lock down their phones to protect their privacy? Others are hesitant about moving around within the country, after stories like that of a U.S. citizen accused of being here illegally and detained even after his mother produced his birth certificate.",
      "Sesay said he doesn't travel domestically anymore without his passport, despite having a REAL ID with its federally mandated, stringent identity requirements.",
      "Immigration enforcement roundups, often conducted by masked, unidentifiable federal agents in places including Chicago and New York City, have at times included American citizens in their dragnets. One U.S. citizen who says he was detained by immigration agents twice has filed a federal lawsuit.",
      "Adding to the worries, the Justice Department issued a memo this summer saying it would ramp up efforts to denaturalize immigrants who\u2019ve committed crimes or are deemed to present a national security risk. At one point during the summer, Trump threatened the citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City, who naturalized as a young adult.",
      "The atmosphere makes some worried to speak about it publicly, for fear of drawing negative attention to themselves. Requests for comment through several community organizations and other connections found no takers willing to go on the record other than Sesay.",
      "In New Mexico, state Sen. Cindy Nava says she's familiar with the fear, having grown up undocumented before getting DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected people brought to the U.S. as children from being deported \u2014 and gaining citizenship through her marriage. But she hadn't expected to see so much fear among naturalized citizens.",

      "What citizenship has meant, and who was included, has expanded and contracted over the course of American history, said Stephen Kantrowitz, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said while the word \u201ccitizen\u201d is in the original Constitution, it is not defined.",
      "\u201cWhen the Constitution is written, nobody knows what citizenship means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a term of art, it comes out of the French revolutionary tradition. It sort of suggests an equality of the members of a political community, and it has some implications for the right to be a member of that political community. But it is ... so undefined.\u201d",
      "The first naturalization law passed in 1790 by the new country\u2019s Congress said citizenship was for any \u201cfree white person\u201d of good character. Those of African descent or nativity were added as a specific category to federal immigration law after the ravages of the Civil War in the 19th century, which was also when the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution to establish birthright citizenship.",
      "In the last years of the 19th century and into the 20th century, laws were put on the books limiting immigration and, by extension, naturalization. The Immigration Act of 1924 effectively barred people from Asia because they were ineligible for naturalization, being neither white nor Black. That didn't change until 1952, when an immigration law removed racial restrictions on who could be naturalized. The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act replaced the previous immigration system with one that portioned out visas equally among nations.",
      "American history also includes times when those who had citizenship had it taken away, like after the 1923 Supreme Court ruling in U.S. vs. Bhagat Singh Thind. That ruling said that Indians couldn't be naturalized because they did not qualify as white and led to several dozen denaturalizations. At other times, it was ignored, as in World War II, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps.",
      "\u201cPolitical power will sometimes simply decide that a group of people, or a person or a family isn\u2019t entitled to citizenship,\u201d Kantrowitz said.",
      "In this moment, Sesay says, it feels like betrayal.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America \u2014 that\u2019s what I took that oath of allegiance, that\u2019s what I make commitment to,\u201d Sesay said. \u201cNow, inside my home country, and I\u2019m seeing a shift. ... Honestly, that is not the America I believe in when I put my hand over my heart.\u201d",

      "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's efforts to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids is on the verge of approval",
      "A judge said Friday that he planned to approve a deal for OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family who own the company to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids, allowing money to start flowing to victims as soon as next spring.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane said he would spell out his reasoning in a hearing next week.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Members of the Sackler family have been cast as villains in an overdose epidemic that has been linked to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "While most opioids were sold by other companies, many people have described the marketing of OxyContin, which was sold starting in 1996, as part of what touched off the crisis.",
      "With legal troubles mounting, family members left the company's board of directors in 2018 and have not received any payouts from it since then. But in the decade prior to that, they received more than $10 billion from the company that has been in the family for decades. About half that money went to pay taxes.",
      "Under the deal, they'll contribute up to $7 billion and cease to own the company.",
      "They'll also be barred from being in the opioid business in other countries and agree not to have their names put on any institutions as part of charitable contributions. Many museums and universities have already cut ties with the family.",
      "The plan also calls for changing Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue's name to Knoa Pharma and making it an entity dedicated to the public good with a board appointed by state officials.",
      "It could still produce OxyContin, but the vision is that the company's profits will address the nation's opioid crisis.",
      "It also would be subject to independent monitoring, as Purdue has been for the past several years.",
      "The company agreed to make public millions of internal documents \u2014 including many that would normally be subject to attorney-client privilege.",

      "There's been a series of other opioid settlements over the past decade worth about $50 billion in total. Most of that money, like most of the Purdue settlement, is required to be used to deal with the overdose and addiction epidemic.",

      "This part of the settlement is expected to be paid next year, while amounts going to government entities can be paid over 15 years.",
      "But the individual payouts are a frustration for victims. Those who qualify by showing they were prescribed OxyContin are expected to be able to collect around $8,000 or $16,000 each, depending on how long they took the powerful painkillers.",
      "A judge approved a previous Purdue settlement plan in 2021, but it was undone by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that found Sackler family members would have improperly received protections from lawsuits though they themselves hadn't filed for bankruptcy protection.",
      "This time, an appeal is less likely, in part because by the time this week's hearing on the plan was complete, no one represented by a lawyer was objecting to it. A handful of individual victims who do not have lawyers involved were the only ones who kept pushing back.",

      "The replacements came after online commenters seized on striking similarities in the president's signature across a series of pardons dated Nov. 7, including those granted to former New York Mets player Darryl Strawberry, former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon. In fact, the signatures on several pardons initially uploaded to the Justice Department's website were identical, two forensic document experts confirmed to The Associated Press.",
      "Within hours of the online speculation, the administration replaced copies of the pardons with new ones that did not feature identical signatures.

His Republican allies in Congress last month released a blistering critique of Biden's alleged \u201cdiminished faculties\u201d and mental state during his term that ranked the Democrat\u2019s use of the autopen among \u201cthe greatest scandals in U.S. history.\u201d",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- New data the Agriculture Department released Friday created serious doubts about whether China will really buy millions of bushels of American soybeans like the Trump administration touted last month after a high-stakes meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "The USDA report released after the government reopened showed only two Chinese purchases of American soybeans since the summit in South Korea that totaled 332,000 metric tons. That's well short of the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to purchase by January and nowhere near the 25 million metric tons she said they would buy in each of the next three years.",
      "American farmers were hopeful that their biggest customer would resume buying their crops. But CoBank's Tanner Ehmke, who is its lead economist for grains and oilseed, said there isn't much incentive for China to buy from America right now because they have plenty of soybeans on hand that they have bought from Brazil and other South American countries this year, and the remaining tariffs ensure that U.S. soybeans remain more expensive than Brazilian beans.",
      "\u201cWe are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,\u201d Ehmke said.",
      "Beijing has yet to confirm any detailed soybean purchase agreement but only that the two sides have reached \u201cconsensus\u201d on expanding trade in farm products. Ehmke said that even if China did promise to buy American soybeans it may have only agreed to buy them if the price was attractive.",
      "Trump said his team spoke with Chinese officials today and they assured the White House they would be purchasing more soybeans, but he didn't offer any details of how much.",
      "\u201cThey're in the process of doing not only a little bit but they'll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "The Chinese tariff on American beans remains high at about 24%, despite a 10-percentage-point reduction following the summit.",
      "Soybean prices fell sharply by 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel Friday. Ehmke said \u201cthat\u2019s the market being shocked by the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.\u201d Prices are still higher than they were before the agreement when they were selling for $10.60 per bushel, but the price may continue to drop unless there are significant new purchases.",
      "Before the trade agreement, Trump had promised farmers would receive an aid package to help them survive the trade war with China. That was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it's not clear whether the administration will offer farmers aid like Trump did in his first administration.",
      "American farmers have been through this before after Trump's first trade war with China. The trade agreement China signed with the United States in 2020 promised massive purchases of U.S. crops. But the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade between the two nations just as the agreement went into effect. In 2022, U.S. farm exports to China hit a record, but then fell.",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",

      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show, has died, Jimmy Kimmel announced on Tuesday. He was 59 years old.",
      "The late-night talk show host\u00a0mourned the death of one of his oldest friends \u2014 whom he met when he was 9 years old \u2014 writing on Instagram that \"[t]o say that we are heartbroken is an understatement.\"",
      "\"The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers,\" Kimmel wrote.",
      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",
      "In 2016, on Escobedo's 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom's car.",
      "\"Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,\" Kimmel recalled.",
      "News of Escobedo's death comes after Thursday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show's guests. The date and cause of Escobedo's death weren't immediately known.",
      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",
      "Escobedo's survivors also include his wife Lori and their two children.",

      "\"It really is an absolute rewiring of how you move through your life,\" LaRue told \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday. \"There's no way to ever go back to innocence.\"",
      "In 2007 LaRue, who starred in \"CSI: Miami,\" and her young daughter, Kaya, first started getting threatening phone calls and letters from an anonymous person. Her story is told in a new two-part documentary called \"My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story.\"",
      "\"What is crazy is we, on 'CSI: Miami,' we were solving cases in 43 minutes, not including commercials. In real life we did not have the technology we were pretending to have on the show,\" LaRue said.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning actress said she and her daughter had to move twice. At one point, her stalker found her daughter's high school and pretended to be her father, \"and told her to stand out in front of the school and he was going to pick her up.\"",
      "The stalking went on for more than a decade and affected her physically, causing hair loss and hives.",
      "\"There was no place to hide because you don't know where he could be, so you are really in a prison of your own making because you are trying to be four steps ahead of what he could do and those possibilities are endless,\" she said.",

      "The next morning, she found out it was a break-in \u2014 but not her stalker.",
      "\"All I had done was pray all day and all night for months at that point for some sort of guidance. I really felt like it was my answer that God literally said in that moment, 'If I wanted you dead, I'll follow you to Italy,'\" she said.",

      "As a public figure with a massive social media following, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is no stranger to threats and abuse online. But recently, the entrepreneur says he's become \"far more aware\" of how he could face these threats in everyday life.",
      "\"You know, you start getting into these yahoos on social media, and there's, like, yahoos,\" Portnoy told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil in an interview airing on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" this weekend. \"I don't even know what they're saying. But they start talking about me, trying to get my name probably used because they're just in this endless cycle of needing to stay in the news.\"",
      "Conversations about him can quickly spiral online and \"open the floodgates on just lunatics,\" Portnoy said. In response, the businessman and social media personality said he has installed round-the-clock security at his house. \"It only takes one,\" Portnoy added.",
      "Recently, a man was overheard on video shouting an antisemitic comment and throwing coins toward Portnoy while he was recording his famous \"One Bite\" pizza review outside of a Mississippi restaurant. Starkville Police on Monday arrested the alleged heckler, identified as 20-year-old Patrick McClintock, on a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace.",
      "\"Every person has the right to feel safe and respected in our community. Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior disrupts a public event or risks violence, the Starkville Police Department will take steps to help maintain safety and security,\" the police said in a statement to CBS News, adding that the state could impose enhanced penalties if a violation meets the criteria for bias-motivated or discriminatory reason. The incident remains under investigation.",
      "\"Imagine hating somebody just because of their religion in this f---ing country,\" Portnoy said in a social media video posted after the incident.",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased almost 900% in the past 10 years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, in many cases involving violence.",
      "Even before that recent incident, there had been a \"definitive shift\" toward antisemitism, Portnoy told Dokoupil, adding that it was a form of hate that he experiences on a daily basis.",
      "\"For me, being a Jewish person, like, you got to step up,\" he said. \"You're kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to be, like, 'All right, this is not normal ha-ha with the guys. People are coming up with real hate.'\"",

      "The man died in September 2024, but\u00a0researchers just recently linked the death to the allergy, known as alpha-gal syndrome, or AGS.",
      "According to experts, the bite of a Lone Star tick can lead an individual to develop a sensitivity or allergy to alpha galactose, a carbohydrate found in red meat and dairy products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says AGS\u00a0can cause hives, nausea, stomach pain, breathing issues and swelling.",
      "Man died several hours after eating hamburger at barbecue",
      "According to researchers, a 47-year-old New Jersey man went on a camping trip with his wife and children in summer 2024, and after spending the day outdoors, they had beef steak for dinner. About four hours later, researchers say the man experienced severe abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and vomiting that lasted about two hours.",
      "The man apparently felt better the following morning, but when discussing what had happened with his family, he allegedly said, \"I thought I was going to die.\" However, he decided not to consult a doctor about the symptoms, researchers say.",
      "About two weeks later, researchers say the man attended a barbecue where he ate a hamburger. About four hours after eating, the man was found unconscious on the bathroom floor with vomit around him. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead several hours later.",
      "The man's name was not released, nor was the location he went camping.",
      "Postmortem blood test reveals allergic reaction to alpha-gal",
      "The man's death was ruled a \"sudden unexplained death,\" but his wife asked a friend in the medical field to review the autopsy report. The doctor contacted researchers in Virginia to look into the possible role of AGS.",
      "Earlier this year, the man's blood was tested, and researchers say it was determined he had suffered an allergic reaction to alpha-gal consistent with fatal anaphylaxis.",
      "The man's wife said that earlier in the summer, he had gotten about a dozen bug bites around his ankles believed to be from Lone Star tick larvae.",
      "According to researchers, this is \"the first documented anaphylactic death related to AGS where the symptoms started several hours after consuming mammalian meat.\"",
      "Doctors want to raise awareness of alpha-gal syndrome",
      "The researchers argue more public education on AGS is necessary, considering the increased presence of Lone Star ticks in northern states and the fact that abdominal pain is not widely recognized as a possible symptom of an allergic reaction.",
      "\"Although this is very, very uncommon\u2013 what happened to him is not likely to happen to other people. I'm not afraid of that,\" said Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills with UVA Health. \"But they should know about it.\"",
      "\"If they start noticing they're developing abdominal pain, rashes after eating red meat, they should talk to their physicians about the possibility that they've been sensitized to this specific carbohydrate within red meat,\" said Dr. Suraj Saggar, chief of infectious disease at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, \"and understand that if they continue to eat it, there is at least the potential for having a very serious and even fatal reaction.\"",
      "Experts say people who live in areas where Lone Star ticks are common, like New York and New Jersey, should do what they can to avoid tick bites.",
      "\"With the changing seasons, the warming of our climate, these ticks are increasing in their numbers. The potential exposures are increasing,\" Saggar said. \"People should take all the precautions they can to protect [from] tick bites.\"",

      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

      "There is a new FDA-approved eye drop on the market called Vizz. This once-daily, prescription eye drop is said to help combat presbyopia, otherwise known as age-related blurry vision.",
      "Drugmaker LENZ Therapeutics touts that with just one drop in each eye, a person's vision will improve for up to 10 hours, so they won't have to wear reading glasses.",
      "Dr. Robert Johnson Jr. has been running Johnson Family Eyecare in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, for 46 years, and he explains that these eye drops basically act like a focus on a camera lens.",
      "\"Vizz and the drug that has come before it, Vuity, have both worked on the same structural function; they cause your iris, or the colored part of your eye, to get smaller and smaller,\" Dr. Johnson explained. \"As your pupil gets smaller, it becomes apparent that it is like looking through a pinhole, and your depth of focus therefore increases.\"",
      "Vizz is priced at $79 a month for 25 doses and $198 for three months, 75 doses, but prices may vary at different pharmacies. There are some side effects, including eye redness, headaches, and dimmed vision.",
      "Dr. Johnson cautions that while these new eye drops may help some, they are not a cure-all for presbyopia, but rather, they are just another good tool in the fight against age-related blurry vision.",
      "\"It will work much better for the younger, 40, 50, 55-year-old patients than it will for the 60, 65, 70-year-old patients,\" Dr. Johnson said. \"Because they have less of a need to focus. By the time you get to be my age, your natural ability to focus is all gone. Therefore, the pupil would have to be made obsessively smaller and smaller. And if that pupil becomes too small, we begin to lose the amount of light that gets into the eye, and now you are going to have a 70-year-old who can read, but who can't drive when the sun goes down.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:48:09 -0500",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",
      "\"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

    "summary": "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday, ending a blackout for customers that dragged on for about two weeks.",
      "\"As part of the new deal, Disney's full suite of networks and stations \u2013 including ESPN and ABC \u2013 have already begun to be restored to YouTube TV subscribers,\" The Walt Disney Co. said in a statement. \"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football.\"",
      "Disney content had gone dark on YouTube TV the night of Oct. 30, after the two sides failed to reach a new licensing deal. In the days that followed, YouTube TV subscribers were left without Disney channels on the platform \u2014 notably disrupting coverage of top U.S. college football matchups and professional sports games, among other news and entertainment offerings.",
      "Beyond ESPN and ABC, other Disney-owned content removed from YouTube TV during the impasse included channels like NatGeo, FX, Freeform, SEC Network, ACC Network and more.",
      "At the time the carriage dispute reached its boiling point, YouTube TV said that Disney was proposing terms that would be too costly, resulting in higher prices and fewer choices for its subscribers. And the platform accused Disney of using the blackout \"as a negotiating tactic\" \u2014 claiming that the move also benefited Disney's own streaming products like Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.",
      "Disney, meanwhile, said that YouTube TV had refused to pay fair rates for its channels. The California entertainment giant also accused Google of \"using its market dominance to eliminate competition.\" And executives blasted the platform for pulling content \"prior to the midnight expiration\" of their deal last month.",
      "On Nov. 3, Disney also asked YouTube TV to restore ABC programming for Election Day on Nov. 4 to put \"the public interest first.\" But YouTube TV said this temporary reprieve would confuse customers \u2014 and instead proposed that the entertainment giant agree to restore both its ABC and ESPN channels while the two sides continued negotiations.",
      "The blackout marked the latest in a growing list of licensing disputes in today's streaming world. And consumers often pay the price.",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years, as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But amid growing competition, renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations \u2014 and at times service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV and Disney have been down this road before. In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers also briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform after a similar contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, YouTube TV has removed other networks from its platform after expired agreements. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision has been unavailable on YouTube TV since Sept. 30, for example. At the time, its parent company TelevisaUnivision decried Google's move \u2014 noting it would strip \"millions of Hispanic viewers of the Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment they rely on every day\" and called on the platform to reverse course.",
      "YouTube TV's base subscription plan costs $82.99 per month \u2014 which, beyond Disney content, currently includes live TV offerings from networks like NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS and more. The platform previously said it would give subscribers a $20 credit if its dispute with Disney lasted \"an extended period of time\" \u2014 which it reportedly allowed customers to start claiming on Nov. 9.",
      "Disney also doles out live TV through both traditional broadcasting and its own lineup of streaming platforms. ESPN launched its own streamer earlier this year, starting at $29.99 a month. And other Disney content can be found on platforms like Hulu, Disney+ and Fubo. Disney currently allows people to bundle ESPN along with Hulu and Disney+ for $35.99 a month \u2014 or $29.99 a month for the first year.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump exempted foods like beef, coffee and bananas from his sweeping country-by-country tariffs on Friday, as his administration grapples with cost-of-living frustrations and\u00a0quickly rising prices for some types of food.",
      "The new exemption covers a range of tropical products that are often imported to the United States, including coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, coconuts, pineapples, cocoa and spices such as nutmeg, according to an executive order. It also covers beef, oranges and tomatoes.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump decided to exempt the products on Friday because he's made \"substantial progress\" in negotiating trade deals with other countries. A day earlier, Mr. Trump announced trade frameworks with four Latin American countries \u2014 Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador \u2014 that included relief for food that isn't widely produced in the U.S.",
      "The food products will no longer be covered by the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on most U.S. trading partners, which range from 10% to 40% or more. Some types of food could still be impacted by other forms of tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday the tariff exemptions should cause prices to go down, and they mostly applied to food that is \"not competitive in this country,\" like bananas.",
      "\"We don't make them in this country, so there's no protection of our industries or our food products,\" he said aboard Air Force One.",
      "The moves come as polls show that voters remain nervous about inflation and wary of Mr. Trump's approach to the issue, which helped propel him back to the White House last year.",
      "Food prices rose 3.1% in the yearlong period ending in September, well below its peak of 11.4% in 2022, according to federal data. But certain types of food have surged: Beef prices were up 12.9% year-over-year in September, banana prices were up 6.9% and roasted coffee 18.9%.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted\u00a0costs are actually down since he took over from former President Joe Biden, and has long denied that higher tariffs could push up consumer prices \u2014 a persistent fear raised by economists.",
      "But rising beef prices have alarmed Mr. Trump, who accused foreign-owned meat packing companies earlier this month of \"driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.\"",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said he's considering importing more beef from Argentina to help get prices down. It's a delicate issue, though, because boosting beef imports could upset U.S.-based ranchers, who are typically supportive of the president. Trade groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association publicly criticized the idea.",
      "Mr. Trump responded on Truth Social that ranchers \"have to get their prices down.\"",
      "\"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" he wrote. \"If it weren't for me, they would be doing just as they've done for the past 20 years \u2014 Terrible!\"",

      "The Trump administration is\u00a0scrapping a proposed Biden-era rule\u00a0that would have made airlines pay customers for long waits when their flights were delayed, according to a document from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "The Transportation Department on Friday\u00a0published a notice that it is officially withdrawing the proposed rule, introduced in 2024 under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The regulation would have required airlines to pay passengers $200 to $300 for domestic delays lasting at least three hours, and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "The agency, which announced in September that it planned to abandon the proposal, said the notice will be published in the Federal Register on Monday. The passenger protection measure would have created \"unnecessary regulatory burdens,\" the Transportation Department said Friday.",
      "In October, a group of Democratic senators defended the regulation in a letter to the Trump administration, calling it a \"common-sense proposal\" that would have held airlines accountable for their mistakes. They noted that delays can place a financial strain on families when they are forced to rebook flights or secure overnight accommodations.",
      "Customers in the U.S. are entitled to refunds for canceled flights, but no similar protections are in place for delays.",
      "The agency on Friday explained its rationale for ditching the measure, saying the move would \"allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.\"",
      "When reached for comment Friday, the Transportation Department told CBS News that the \"Biden-Buttigieg proposal was just that \u2014 a proposal.\"",

      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chairman of the Senate health committee, says \"we're absolutely in communication with the White House\" about a plan to bring down the cost of health care for Americans.",
      "He told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview airing Sunday he's aiming to have a proposal ready for a vote that is set to take place in mid-December.",
      "Tax credits for about 22 million Americans who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace were at the center of the government shutdown that ended Wednesday. A Biden-era expansion of those subsidies is expiring at the end of the year, so unless they're extended, many consumers will likely face far higher insurance premiums.",
      "Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but they eventually settled for the promise of a vote next month on extending the enhanced tax credits.",
      "Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said of any plan to extend the subsidies, \"Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies.\"",
      "Instead, he's asking Republican and Democratic colleagues to collaborate on lowering health insurance premiums and directly giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA.",
      "\"We can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles,\" Cassidy told Brennan. He said he's telling Democrats, \"Let's not be Democrats and Republicans \u2014 let's be Americans, representing all of Americans.\"",
      "President Trump offered a similar idea last weekend, writing on Truth Social the money that's spent on health insurance subsidies should be \"SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE.\"",
      "Brennan pressed Cassidy on extending the expanded tax credits, which were created in 2021 and are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Noting the approximately 293,000 Louisianans currently enrolled in Obamacare, Brennan asked, \"Are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that they should make plans no for higher prices?\"",
      "Cassidy countered that the problem with the plans was that many of them have high deductibles, with some reaching $6,000 in out-of-pocket costs. The lower-premium \"bronze\" plans on the ACA's marketplaces often have high deductibles.",
      "\"Margaret, I'm a doctor,\" Cassidy said. \"I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, 'I can't afford that. My deductible is too high.' That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion.\"",

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "summary": "Some businesses say steeper U.S. tariffs this year give them less financial room to offer holiday savings.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers.",
      "Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales.",
      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:21:13 -0500",
    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\"",

    "story": [
      "Walmart on Friday said CEO Doug McMillon, who started his career with the retailer as an hourly worker and who has led the company since 2014, will retire in January.",
      "McMillon, 59, will step down as CEO on Jan. 31 but remain on the retailer's board of directors until its annual shareholders' meeting. John Furner, who has served as president and CEO of Walmart U.S. since 2019, will take over as chief executive on Feb. 1.",
      "McMillon oversaw an expansion of tech-based initiatives at Walmart, such as investing in e-commerce and artificial intelligence, while also increasing wages and benefits for Walmart's 2.1 million workers. Under his tenure, Walmart's shares surged more than 300%, buoyed by rising sales and profitability.",
      "\"McMillon is very highly regarded by investors and helped the company navigate a volatile retail landscape over the last ~12 years as CEO,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a research note, adding that his retirement is \"somewhat surprising.\"",
      "Since McMillon became CEO in February 2014, Walmart's annual revenue has grown from nearly $486 billion to $681 billion in its latest fiscal year.",
      "\"People thought he would stay on longer given how well the company is performing and his relatively young age,\" Crisafulli noted.",
      "McMillon had told the Wall Street Journal in March 2023 that he pledged to remain in his role for another three years as the company searched for a successor. McMillon has spent his entire career at Walmart, starting in 1984 as an associate who picked orders and unloaded trailers in a warehouse, according to his company bio.",
      "Furner, 51, has proved to be a \"strong leader\" as he managed Walmart's U.S. business, said GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders in a research note. But, he added, McMillon's retirement \"will send a small shockwave through Walmart, simply because he has been an excellent leader and steward of the company, he said.",
      "In a statement, McMillon said he's worked with Furner for more than 20 years. \"His love for our associates and this company runs deep. His curiosity and digital acumen combined with a deep commitment to our people and culture will enable him to take us to the next level,\" McMillon said in the statement.",
      "McMillon will serve as an adviser to Furner through Jan. 31, 2027, Walmart\u00a0said.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An extension of enhanced ACA tax credits appears unlikely, experts say, leaving millions of Americans facing potentially higher health plan costs in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of health care remains in limbo for roughly 22 million Americans after the U.S. government reopened late Wednesday without a deal to extend an expiring federal tax credit that offsets the cost of some Affordable Care Act plans.",
      "The fate of the enhanced premium tax credit had been at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history as Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidy in order to reopen the government.",
      "The Senate\u00a0voted late Sunday\u00a0on a deal to end the shutdown that did not resolve the future of the tax credit \u2014 a central demand of Democrats during the government funding fight. On Wednesday, the House approved the Senate-passed funding package to end the 43-day shutdown. President Trump signed the legislation shortly after.",
      "To secure the Democratic votes needed to reopen the government, Senate Republicans\u00a0agreed to hold a separate vote\u00a0on extending the ACA tax credits by mid-December. But a vote isn't guaranteed to succeed, and even if the legislation makes it out of the Senate, House GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Americans are now choosing their 2026 health plans on the ACA's online marketplaces, and without congressional action, the tax credits will expire Dec. 31.",
      "\"A lot of people are sort of in this limbo state where they have to buy their insurance for next year, but they really don't know how this is going to shake out at the federal level,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at nonprofit health policy site KFF, told CBS News.",
      "What happens without an extension?",
      "The subsidies were introduced in 2021 through the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, and then extended for three more years in the Inflation Reduction Act. Without any action on Congress's part, the enhanced premium tax credits will disappear at the end of 2025.",
      "That means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums more than double next year, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF analysis.",
      "Faced with higher costs for ACA insurance, about 4 million people are likely to drop their health coverage, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "\"Americans are really just seeing how expensive health care is in this country, and it's just completely unaffordable for a lot of people to pay their own entire health insurance premium,\" Wager said.",
      "Currently, the enhanced ACA premium tax credit is available for people who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which sets the upper threshold at $62,000 for an individual, according to KFF. However, some Americans who earn above that 400% benchmark can qualify for the tax credit if their insurance rates exceed 8.5% of their income.",
      "Three-quarters of Americans favor renewing the subsidies, according to recent KFF polling. That includes 94% of Democrats and about half of Republicans.",
      "If Congress renews the subsidies, federal and state marketplaces would need to retool the 2026 plans already available to consumers. It's possible a new plan could be made retroactive to January 2026, even if it's passed later in the year, Wager said.",
      "\"At that point, people are sort of locked in on whatever plan they chose, but they can retroactively receive the tax credit,\" she noted.",
      "Are there other options from Congress?",
      "Congress could pursue other ways to make health coverage more affordable. On Saturday, President Trump called for sending the money saved by not extending the tax subsidies \"directly to the people.\" On his Truth Social platform, he criticized the ACA and said Americans should be able to use the savings to purchase other kinds of insurance.",
      "\"In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare,\" he wrote.",
      "Wager said it remains to be seen if Mr. Trump's plan is feasible, saying \"we haven't seen a concrete enough proposal at this point.\"",
      "Some lawmakers have offered similar proposals, such as Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. In a floor speech last week, he said eligible Americans could be sent \"a pre-funded federal flexible spending account\" to use for health expenses, from dental care to prescription drugs and preventive services.",
      "In the meantime, as 2026 approaches and the future of the enhanced premium tax credit remains unclear, enrollees should consider speaking with a health insurance expert to get advice on their options, Wager advised.",
      "\"The most important thing that you can do is talk to somebody \u2014 an agent, broker or a navigator \u2014 who can help you make sure that you really understand what your options are and that you get the best plan for your financial situation and your health care situation,\" she said.",

At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said.",
      "It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said.

      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to the latest data from Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit 40-year highs following the pandemic.",
      "Although the pace of inflation has declined since 2022, food insecurity is likely rising because food prices remain far above pre-pandemic levels, according to Poonam Gupta, a research associate at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"Even though inflation slowed a lot this year, we're nowhere near the amount that we were spending on food even just a couple of years ago,\" she said.",
      "Gupta also said more Americans could struggle to put food on the table in 2026, with an estimated 2.4 million SNAP recipients potentially losing benefits due to new work requirements in the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law in July by President Trump.",
      "The Purdue researchers define food insecurity as some members of a household at times not being able to afford a balanced meal, as well as occasionally having to skip a meal or eating less for financial reasons.",
      "Purdue's survey has become one of the few remaining national measures of food insecurity, since the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled its annual Household Food Security survey in September, which had been conducted since 2001.",
      "In scrapping the USDA assessment of food insecurity, the Trump administration said\u00a0in September that the survey was \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous.\"",

      "Optimize your online presence",
      "It's easy for recruiters to search for a candidate online and access reams of personal and professional information about them.",
      "This is why one's online presence is increasingly important.",
      "\"Think about what someone who Googles your name sees,\" Pong said. \"Do they even see me if I have a common name? If they do see me, is something coming up that is not just my LinkedIn profile? What's better is if it's that plus other things that demonstrate in the first couple of hits what you stand for, what your value add is and what are you passionate about.\"",
      "That can be achieved by building a personal website highlighting past work, for example.",
      "Indeed, recruiters comb platforms like LinkedIn for candidates whose experience and professional goals align with their own staffing needs.",

    "story": [
      "Money might not buy you love, but the tab for finding romance online is rising.",
      "The increasing cost of dating apps, matchmaking services and, for those looking for an even bigger edge, love coaching can require singles to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars in pursuit of finding a partner \u2014 and that's before the first date.",
      "Although most apps operate on a so-called \"freemium\" model, upgrades and premium features that dating services claim will your boost success rate can greatly increase expenses. Popular dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, The League and others still offer free versions, but charge users for additional features the companies promise will deliver better experiences \u2014 and more desirable romantic prospects \u2014 as the services look to monetize their platforms.",

      "Research from Morgan Stanley found that about 32% of single people in the U.S. use online dating services, and just over a quarter of them pay. The average paying user spends between $18 and $19 a month on either subscriptions or \u00e0 la carte purchases, according to the study.",
      "On Match Group-owned Hinge, for example, upgrading to Hinge+ costs $100 for six months, or $17 a month. That allows users to \"like\" an unlimited number of prospects, see who likes them and be more choosy about prospective matches. Hinge notes that it offers a free membership along with it calls \"cost-effective\" subscriptions.",
      "\"Users are often looking for additional support and efficiency with getting out on dates, and subscriptions empower them with additional tools on their dating journey,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Another dating app called The League costs $400 for three months. For that price, members are shown five prospects daily, can hide their age on their profiles, scout prospects from two cities at once and receive other perks.",
      "Worthwhile upgrade?",
      "Some dating coaches who help people refine what they're looking for in a partner encourage their clients to upgrade to pricier dating app subscriptions.",
      "\"The premium paid services make a lot of sense to me,\" said Natalia Juarez, a dating coach who specializes in breakup recovery and dating strategy.",
      "Although some might scoff at the concept of paying through the nose in affairs of the heart, Juarez compared shelling out on dating apps to paying for premium service from rideshare companies like Lyft and music streaming services like Spotify.",
      "\"People understand the value of upgrading \u2014 it has infiltrated all areas of life. I am not surprised dating apps have done same thing,\" Juarez said.",
      "Relationship coach Amie Leadingham also acknowledged the paradigm shift that has made more people feel comfortable paying up to make a love connection.",
      "\"I do recommend going to the paid sites over the free sites, because the free sites are full of fake profiles and scammers. When you invest you have more intention, and it shows you're being more serious about online dating,\" Leadingham told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "If you don't pay, \"you're not getting dates\"",
      "For their part, some people who pay for premium dating services say the upgrades are worth it, while also wishing the free offerings were improved.",
      "New York-based entrepreneur Bretton Auerbach, a Harvard University graduate and founder of real estate marketplace Triple.com, has been paying for dating apps for years. When he first started using dating apps, including Tinder, roughly a decade ago, he quickly encountered two challenges: First, it was taking up a lot of his time and second, he was bumping up against limits on how many peoples' profiles he could like.",
      "To save time and meet more people, Auerbach signed up for paid versions of a handful of dating apps and found himself spending around $1,000 per month on paid features. That allowed him to view roughly 100 profiles, which he'd whittle down to a date or two.",
      "\"If you're not paying, you're not getting dates,\" Auerbach said. He compared these features such as \"boosts\" that raise your profile's visibility to \"going into a casino where you buy a bunch of chips, throw them in a slot machine where the wheels spin, and you hope you see someone attractive.",
      "Notably, he also conceded that he's spent \"a lot of money\" on dating apps, and ultimately hasn't found them that useful.",
      "\"The best dating experiences I've had have mostly been through meeting people through my social network,\" Auerbach said.",
      "Bianca Kenworthy, founder and CEO of Pomme Creative, a hospitality consultancy, is a former paid dating app user,who met her husband on Hinge. She upgraded for similar reasons to Auerbach.",
      "\"You need the apps because that's how you meet people now. Our time is precious, and the apps allow you to vet in some ways the person you're meeting up with,\" she said.",
      "Kenworthy thinks the prospects she was shown on Hinge's paid service were better suited for her. \"I understood the potential people were more curated for you, based on an algorithm,\" she explained.",
      "As far as the monthly fee, Kenworthy said it was worth it. \"That's like what a pedicure costs. I was looking for a life partner, and I saw it as a monthly investment that could potentially find me that person.\"",

      "Walt Disney Co. executives on Thursday warned that the company's dispute with YouTube could drag on, leaving subscribers to the Google-owned video platform without access to ABC, ESPN, FX and other programming from the entertainment giant.",
      "Disney channels went dark on YouTube TV on Oct. 30 amid a so-called carriage dispute between the two companies. YouTube\u00a0said in a blog post\u00a0last month that Disney had followed through on a threat to pull its networks \"as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers.\"",
      "Asked in a Thursday investor call about the ongoing negotiations, Disney Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said that \"these discussions could go for a little while,\" without providing a timeframe or additional details.",
      "\"[W]e care deeply about our consumer,\" Disney CEO Robert Iger said in the call. \"And our priority has always been to remain on their service without interruption to close a deal on a timely basis so that interruption does not occur. The deal that we have proposed is equal to or better than what other large distributors have already agreed to.\"",
      "What are carriage fees?",
      "Providers of pay-TV services like YouTube TV pay carriage fees to network owners, including Disney, for the right to broadcast their channels. Disputes over the fees are common, with content providers often at loggerheads with TV networks over commercial terms when their deals expire.",
      "The conflicts sometimes result in viewers losing access to a company's channels or content if the negotiations extend beyond the end of a contract.",

      "Starbucks Workers United is calling the strike the \"red cup rebellion,\" since it coincides with the coffee chain's annual Red Cup Day promotion, when it gives away free reusable holiday cups at its retail locations. Starbucks Workers United, which represents more than 9,500 baristas across 550 Starbucks cafes, is asking for better pay, increased staffing and a resolution of labor disputes.",
      "The strike will start with more than 65 stores in over 40 cities across the country, the union said, noting that the labor action has no prescribed end date.",
      "\"There are already stores that have been shut down for the day, and we anticipate there to be dozens more that have to shut down today as well,\" Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen, who has worked as a barista at Starbucks for 15 years, said during a press call Thursday morning.",
      "Workers United said it is prepared to escalate the strike if Starbucks does not deliver a contract and \"resolve unfair labor practice charges.\"",
      "\"If Starbucks keeps stonewalling a fair contract and refusing to end union-busting, they'll see their business grind to a halt,\" Eisen said in a statement. \"No contract, no coffee is more than a tagline \u2014 it's a pledge to interrupt Starbucks operations and profits until a fair union contract and an end to unfair labor practices are won.\"",
      "Starbucks describes strike impact as \"minimal\"",

      "Starbucks said it offers the equivalent of $30 an hour in pay and employee benefits. However, Workers United claims that many workers aren't getting enough hours to qualify for benefits. The union told CBS News that the starting wage for baristas is $15.25 in a majority of states.",
      "\"The reality is I make $17 an hour, and I live paycheck to paycheck,\" said Starbucks barista and Chicago resident Diego Franco. \"I can't sustain myself on that. I can't sustain my mom's medical bills.\"",
      "Starbucks Workers United announced last week that its members had\u00a0voted to authorize a strike, with 92% of members backing a work stoppage.",
      "\"We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table,\" Anderson told CBS News in a statement at the time. \"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "Contract talks between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are non-economic proposals.",
      "Sharon Block, a professor at Harvard Law School, told CBS News the fitful contract negotiations between Starbucks and its organized workforce highlight the weakness of federal labor law in bringing employers to the bargaining table.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:43:55 -0500",
    "summary": "A government funding package signed by President Trump on Wednesday will reopen federal agencies, opening the door for food-stamp recipients to collect their full benefits.",
    "story": [
      "After weeks of uncertainty, millions of Americans will soon start receiving federal nutrition assistance benefits again, after President Trump on Wednesday night signed a bill passed by Congress to end the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0in U.S. history.",
      "The legislation funds Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits through September 2026. It also reimburses the program's contingency reserves to account for expenditures during the government shutdown.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states last month that it would not fund SNAP, also known as food stamps, for November if the shutdown continued. Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits to help pay for groceries.",
      "An agency spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that SNAP recipients in most states will get their benefits \"within 24 hours\" after the government shutdown ends. The Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News they expect the flow of benefits to start relatively quickly once the shutdown ends, but noted that the exact timeline could differ by state.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger, said states that have already attempted to issue the full November payment should be able to move fast, while others may need a few days to deal with administrative issues.",
      "\"States that did not issue full benefits earlier will need to resubmit their files to their EBT vendors for processing, which may take a few additional days,\" she said.",
      "Crystal FitzSimons, president of FRAC, recommended that food-stamp participants check their state family and social services websites for updates on when payments will go out.",
      "SNAP timing differs by state",
      "At least 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, issued full benefits to at least some recipients last week, according to The Associated Press. That funding was distributed in the short window between a Nov. 6 court ruling that required the federal government to make full SNAP payments and a ruling the following day by the Supreme Court that blocked the lower court's order.",
      "In addition, 16 states have loaded the EBT cards used in SNAP with partial benefits, the AP reported.",
      "Although federal agencies could soon be set to reopen, experts said the interruption in nutrition aid has already hurt many Americans who lean on SNAP to put food on the table.",
      "\"You can't eat retroactively when your SNAP was delayed,\" Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, told CBS News. \"Getting your [delayed] benefits is better than never getting them at all, but it doesn't help the harm that you experienced in the past.\"",

    "summary": "One contentious point was whether Shikha Garg suffered pain in her final moments, with Boeing arguing that passengers didn't experience physical pain before impact.",
    "story": [
      "A federal court jury has awarded over $28 million to the family of a United Nations consultant who died in the crash of a Boeing 737 Max jetliner in Ethiopia more than six years ago.",
      "The verdict was reached Wednesday on behalf of the relatives of Shikha Garg after two hours of jury deliberation that capped a weeklong trial in Chicago, where Boeing used to have its headquarters. It was the first civil trial stemming from the March 2019 disaster that killed all 157 people on board Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.",
      "\"We and the family are gratified by the jury's verdict. It provides public accountability for Boeing's wrongful conduct,\" the family's lawyers, Shanin Specter and Elizabeth Crawford, said in a statement after the verdict was read in court.",
      "Boeing will pay an additional $3.45 million to Garg's husband, Soumya Bhattacharya, as part of a deal between him and the company reached outside of court. That, along with a 26% interest charge, brings the total amount Boeing will pay to Garg's family to $35.8 million.",
      "The aircraft maker has negotiated pre-trial settlements in most of the dozens of wrongful death lawsuits filed in connection with the crash and a similar 737 Max disaster five months earlier off the coast of Indonesia, although details of the settlements were confidential and not disclosed. Lawyers say less than a dozen lawsuits remain unresolved.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Boeing apologized to all the victims' families and said it respects their right to pursue their claims in court.",
      "Jurors weren't tasked with weighing the aircraft maker's liability in the crash because Boeing has already accepted responsibility. Instead, they were asked to award damages for matters such as loss of income and grief suffered by Garg's family.",
      "Like a number of the other passengers, Garg, a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme, was on her way to attend a U.N. environmental assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.",
      "At trial, Specter painted a picture for the jury of a young and accomplished PhD candidate who was married just months before she boarded the fatal Ethiopian Airlines flight. A citizen of India, Garg wore on the flight a sari and held flower garlands in line with Indian tradition.",
      "The then-new Boeing Max crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Specter called Garg's death \"senseless\" and \"preventable.\"",
      "Boeing lawyer Dan Webb, a former U.S. attorney, urged jurors to focus on \"fair and reasonable\" compensation for Garg's family. One contentious point was whether Garg suffered pain in her final moments before death, with Boeing arguing that the passengers didn't experience physical injury before impact.",
      "\"There would not have been time for them to feel any physical pain when they hit the ground,\" Webb said.",
      "The payout awarded to Garg's family by the jury includes $10 million for the \"pain and suffering and emotional distress\" she experienced before the crash, according to the family's lawyers.",
      "From nearly the moment pilots flying for Ethiopian Airlines took off in their new Boeing jetliner, they encountered problems with the plane. The pilots were bombarded by alarms for six minutes as they fought to fly the plane before entering a final nosedive at nearly 700 miles per hour.",
      "Days later, all Max jets around the world were grounded. Flights resumed in December 2020, but Indonesia didn't lift its ban on the Max for another year and Ethiopian Airlines didn't resume flying the plane until February 2022.",
      "Amid the trial, a federal judge in Texas approved a Justice Department request to dismiss its long-running criminal case against Boeing in connection with the two 737 Max crashes. In exchange, Boeing says it will pay or invest an additional $1.1 billion toward fines, compensation for victims' families, and internal safety and quality improvements.",
      "U.S. prosecutors had charged the company with conspiracy to commit fraud, accusing it of deceiving government regulators about a flight-control system it developed for the 737 Max. In both crashes, the software had pitched the nose of the planes down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor.",
      "Last year, the Justice Department said Boeing accepted a plea deal stemming from the crashes after the government determined the company violated an agreement that had protected it from prosecution for more than three years.\u00a0 The deal only covers wrongdoing by Boeing involving the two deadly crashes. It does not give Boeing immunity for other incidents, including a\u00a0panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0in January 2024.",
      "A scathing report by the House Transportation Committee released in 2020 found multiple Boeing engineers and test pilots expressed concerns about the system that would ultimately be linked to the two deadly 737 Max crashes \u2014 and yet those problems were never fixed. The plane was deemed compliant by the FAA according to existing standards, but was \"demonstratively unsafe,\" casting doubt on the certification process, according to committee investigators.",
      "\"The FAA failed to ensure the safety of the traveling public,\" the report found.",

    "summary": "The president is hosting some of the nation's top financiers for a White House dinner Wednesday as part of his effort to bring manufacturing back home.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is hosting a private White House dinner Wednesday with some of Wall Street's biggest names, as part of his effort to forge stronger ties with America's business leaders and convince them to invest in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose relationship with the president has had its ups and downs, will be attending, as well as Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick, BlackRock's Larry Fink and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, sources familiar with the event planning said.",
      "Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, helped organize the dinner, according to the sources. Lynn Martin, the president of the NYSE, will also be attending.",
      "Others who plan to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner include Citadel founder Ken Griffin, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, Apollo Global Management's Marc Rowan and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, sources said. NYSE President Lynn Martin will also be in attendance.",
      "Many of those attending have been longtime donors to Mr. Trump, and some, like Son, have announced their companies would make significant investments in the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are on the guest list, too.",
      "Bankers have been pitching the administration on handling the IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which will be a major event on Wall Street. Mr. Trump announced in May that he wanted to take the two mortgage giants public, noting at the time that the two had returned to profitability after the government took them over during the 2008 financial crisis. The two entities buy mortgages from lenders and hold them in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold.",
      "Fannie and Freddie are not the focus of the dinner, sources said. Instead, Mr. Trump and top administration officials want to discuss affordability, an issue that Americans said was their top concern in the elections last week, where Democrats swept the major races. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the focus of the meeting was still unclear to some attendees, a banking industry source said Wednesday.",
      "In September, the president hosted more than a dozen tech industry tycoons at the White House, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. And he's held one-on-one events in the Oval Office with a succession of tech and pharmaceutical executives, often to announce multibillion-dollar manufacturing deals.",
      "Last month, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits \u2014 announced it intends to invest $1.5 trillion over the next decade to support \"industries critical to national economic security and resiliency,\" including critical minerals, defense technology and artificial intelligence. That represents a 50% increase from the $1 trillion in investments it had planned, the company said.",
      "Mr. Trump often uses Wall Street as one barometer for his handling of the economy. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired earlier this month, he touted a recent S&P 500 record.",
      "\"We're doing really well, and everybody knows it,\" he said.",
      "But some in the business community have chafed at the president's policies. Stocks plunged in April when Mr. Trump unveiled hefty tariffs on dozens of countries. Though markets have recovered since then, many economists worry the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "His pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates could also clash with Wall Street's strong preference for an independent Fed, and Mr. Trump has faced pushback from the pro-business Chamber of Commerce over a plan to charge hefty fees for high-skilled worker visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's relationship with Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase since before the 2008 financial crisis, has gone through a couple of rough patches. In 2023, Mr. Trump called Dimon a \"Highly overrated Globalist,\" after he talked up Mr. Trump's GOP primary rival, Nikki Haley. But the following year, Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek he had \"a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"",
      "Dimon cautioned in April that Mr. Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth, but told CNBC three months later that the tariffs had been \"greatly moderated.\" He also supported the tax provisions in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier this year, Dimon told \"60 Minutes\" he understood why Mr. Trump won in 2024, and believed people had \"legitimate concerns\" about issues like immigration. He said that \"people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously.\"",

      "Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands \u2014 or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti \u2014 as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.",
      "The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe\u00a0found\u00a0that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.",
      "That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier\u00a0reported\u00a0on the pasta dispute.",
      "If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.",
      "\"You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves,\" Lempert said. \"So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, \"Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'\"",
      "He added that the antidumping duty is a proposal and that it is not yet final. \"The pasta makers still have several months to continue participating in this review before this preliminary finding becomes finalized,\" he said.",
      "Yet some Italian pasta companies are preparing to pull out of U.S. stores as soon as January because of the threat of the new antidumping duty, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Which pasta brands could be affected?",
      "The antidumping duties \u2014 a type of federal tariff applied to imported products sold in the U.S. for less than their market value \u2014 would impact 13 Italian pasta makers, including La Molisana and Garofalo, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce publication.

    "story": [
      "President Trump said he will no longer support Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\" to the GOP, making a dramatic break with a longtime loyalist who has increasingly criticized the president and her party's leadership in recent weeks.",
      "In an almost 300-word missive on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0Friday night, the president said Greene \"has gone Far Left,\" and wrote that \"all I see 'Wacky' Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\"",
      "\"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day,\" he wrote.",
      "The president said he's withdrawing his endorsement of Greene and will support a primary challenge against her \"if the right person runs\" in her deep-red northern Georgia district.",
      "Greene, on Saturday, said in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0that she never thought that \"fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are.\"",
      "\"And it truly speaks for itself,\" she wrote, in part. \"There needs to be a new way forward. The toxic political industrial complex thrives on ripping us all apart but never delivers anything good for the American people, whom I love.\"",
      "The congresswoman also said later Saturday that she has been receiving threats since Mr. Trump began openly criticizing her.",
      "\"Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now,\" Greene said. \"This time by the President of the United States.\"",
      "In her back-and-forth with Mr. Trump which began Friday, Greene said that she \"will continue to pray this administration will be respectful\" despite the fact that the president \"just attacked me and lied about me.\"",
      "\"I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" she wrote on X. \"But I don't worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump escalated his attacks on Greene on Saturday, saying in a Truth Social post: \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Greene is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\"",
      "\"Lightweight Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Brown (Green grass turns Brown when it begins to ROT!), betrayed the entire Republican Party when she turned Left, performed poorly on the pathetic View, and became the RINO that we all know she always was,\" the president said in part in\u00a0another post on Saturday.",
      "A group of more than two dozen people that identify as Epstein survivors, or family members of survivors, released a joint statement Saturday in support of Greene.",
      "\"Thank you for standing up against the intimidation, silencing, and abuse that Epstein survivors have endured for decades,\" the statement read. \"...You have our full support.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the group added that many of them have gotten death threats, adding it's \"part of the price of speaking out.\"",
      "First arriving in Congress in 2021, Greene aligned herself closely with Mr. Trump for years,\u00a0defending the then-former president\u00a0as he faced a\u00a0slew of criminal investigations.",
      "\"I didn't intentionally style myself after President Trump, but I can see how people draw those similarities,\" the often pugnacious and sharp-elbowed\u00a0congresswoman told\u00a0\"60 Minutes\" in a 2023 interview. \"We both come from the same industry, construction. I also have pretty much a plain speaking style, and so does he.\"",
      "In recent weeks, however, Greene has regularly criticized Republican congressional leaders. She's accused them of not paying enough attention to the cost of living and\u00a0failing to grapple\u00a0with rising\u00a0health insurance premiums\u00a0\u2014 drawing\u00a0rare plaudits from Democrats, who made health care a core part of their message in the government shutdown fight that ended this week.",
      "And she's clashed with Mr. Trump. She was\u00a0one of four\u00a0House Republicans to sign a petition that will force a vote on a bill to release Justice Department records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, helping to\u00a0breathe new life\u00a0into an issue that Mr. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly urged Republicans to drop.",
      "In an interview Friday\u00a0with \"CBS Mornings,\" Greene called the president's opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation,\" arguing he has nothing to hide.",
      "In her\u00a0post on X\u00a0after the president withdrew his support for her, Greene accused Mr. Trump of trying to \"make an example\" out of her and \"scare all the other Republicans\" ahead of a vote on releasing the Epstein records\u00a0that is expected to take place\u00a0next week. She posted a screenshot of a text that she said she sent Mr. Trump earlier Friday, encouraging him to \"lean into\" the Epstein controversy.",
      "She also recently accused the president of spending too much time on foreign policy, leading Mr. Trump\u00a0to say\u00a0Monday that she's \"lost her way.\" In her \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0interview, she responded: \"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only.\"",
      "\"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone,\" she said.",
      "In Friday's Truth Social post breaking with the congresswoman, the president suggested next year's Georgia Senate race might be another sore point between him and Greene.",
      "She\u00a0announced in May\u00a0that she will not run for Senate because the chamber's Republican caucus \"refuses to win.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump claimed that he played a role in discouraging her from joining the fray and trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, in what's expected to be one of the most hotly contested races of the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"It seemed to all begin when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor, she was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement \u2014 which she wasn't about to get!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to dispatch scores of Border Patrol agents to Charlotte and New Orleans to oversee immigration enforcement operations that could involve armored vehicles and special operations teams, according to internal government documents and U.S. officials.",
      "Internal DHS preparations reviewed by CBS News listed Charlotte and New Orleans as the next targets of President Trump's mass deportation campaign. Like in\u00a0Chicago\u00a0and\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 which have seen highly visible and often controversial federal immigration arrests in recent months \u2014 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents are expected to play a lead role in the operations in Charlotte and New Orleans.",
      "The planned Border Patrol operation in Charlotte, where an operations center is being stood up, is expected to start soon, as early as next week, two sources familiar with the plans told CBS News.",
      "Garry McFadden, the sheriff of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, said Thursday he had been \"contacted by two separate federal o\ufb03cials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week.\"",
      "Border Patrol's focus is then expected to shift to New Orleans, where as many as 200 CBP agents could be deployed, according to the sources and internal DHS documents.",
      "Armored vehicles, including so-called \"BearCats,\" have been requested for both Charlotte and New Orleans, alongside special operations agents, the internal documents show. Internally, officials have dubbed the plans \"Charlotte Web\" and \"Catahoula Crunch,\" references to the children's novel and the official state dog of Louisiana, respectively.",
      "Many of the Border Patrol agents deployed to the Chicago region earlier this fall, including outspoken commander Gregory Bovino, are expected to participate in the upcoming operations in Charlotte and New Orleans, two U.S. officials said. CBS News was\u00a0first to report\u00a0last week that Bovino and most Border Patrol agents would be leaving Chicago, and that they could be redirected to locations like Charlotte.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed it is \"surging\" agents to Charlotte.",
      "\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. \"There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens, and President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said, \"Public safety is the top priority for all of us in government \u2014 that means fighting crime, not stoking fear or causing division.\"",
      "\"We should all focus on arresting violent criminals and drug traffickers. Unfortunately, that's not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,\" Stein said, noting that many of those detained there had\u00a0no criminal convictions.",
      "He urged North Carolinians \"to remember our values,\" follow the law and remain peaceful. And he added, \"If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement.\"",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Saturday in a joint statement with other local officials, the expected Border Patrol operations are \"causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community, as\u00a0previous operations in other cities like Chicago\u00a0\"have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.\"",
      "The latest plans illustrate the Trump administration's continued reliance on Border Patrol agents to carry out its sweeping, nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "While Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency charged with enforcing U.S. immigration laws in the interior of the country, the Trump administration has deployed teams of Border Patrol agents to Chicago, Los Angeles and other places far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings plunged to a 55-year low in fiscal year 2025.",
      "In both Chicago and Los Angeles, the operations by Border Patrol agents, in many cases personally led by Bovino, have come under scrutiny, sparking protests and tense confrontations with local residents who have denounced the agency's actions as overly aggressive.",
      "ICE officers and Border Patrol agents are all federal immigration officials with the same legal authority to arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally. But their operations typically differ in style and nature.",
      "While ICE has also aggressively expanded immigration enforcement across the country under Mr. Trump, its arrests continue to be, to a large extent, targeted operations driven by intelligence gathering and prior surveillance that typically target people in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes.",
      "In Chicago and Los Angeles, on the other hand, Border Patrol agents have conducted \"roving\" operations that are more indiscriminate in nature, targeting places like Home Depot parking lots and worksites that they believe are frequented by people who don't have legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The use of force that Border Patrol has employed against protesters has also come under withering criticism, including from a federal judge in Chicago who imposed drastic limits on the ability for agents to deploy tear gas and crowd control tactics. Trump administration officials maintain agents have used the necessary force, citing instances of civilians interfering with operations or turning to violence.",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0last month.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's involvement with prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, and major financial institutions.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump accused Democrats of focusing on what he calls the \"Epstein hoax\" to deflect blame for the government shutdown, which ended Wednesday and was the longest in U.S. history.",
      "\"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" the president wrote. \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi soon said she had asked Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation. Clayton's office covers matters from Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as the counties north of New York City.",
      "\"As with all matters, the Department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people,\" she wrote on X.",
      "The announcement comes four months after the Justice Department and FBI\u00a0said in a July memo\u00a0that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of material related to Epstein and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" They also said there was no \"client list\" or \"credible evidence\" that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement comes as the House is expected to vote next week on a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files from its investigation into Epstein. The president opposes the release of that material and has accused Republicans who backed the effort to force a vote on the proposal of being \"soft and foolish.\" GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday that she believes the president's stance on the Epstein files is a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "When asked about the vote on Saturday, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't care about it released or not.\"",
      "\"What I think you should do if you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.",
      "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into the federal government's handling of its probe into Epstein, released earlier this week more than 20,000 pages of material it obtained from Epstein's estate.",
      "Among the records are emails and messages exchanged with Epstein that mention Mr. Trump. In one email from Epstein to author Michael Wolff in January 2019, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referencing Mr. Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's. It's unclear what Epstein was referring to.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "In another email from Epstein to Maxwell in April 2011, he wrote, \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "The president has not been accused of wrongdoing. While he and Epstein ran in the same social circles in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, from the late 1980s to early 2000s, Mr. Trump has said the two had a falling out around 2004 and had not spoken in the years leading up to Epstein's 2019 death.",
      "He died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility after he was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges.",
      "The latest release from the Oversight Committee also shows that Epstein corresponded regularly with Summers, who was treasury secretary during Clinton's presidency and led the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported in 2023 on Epstein's contacts with Summers. A spokesperson for Summers said at the time that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction.\" Epstein was investigated with federal and state officials between 2005 and 2006. Under a deal reached with federal prosecutors in 2007, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month sentence to avoid federal charges. He served less than 13 months and was released in 2009.",
      "As part of its review, the House Oversight panel issued a subpoena to Clinton in August for testimony because of his past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said in 2019 after Epstein was indicted that the former president took four trips on Epstein's plane in 2002 and 2003, traveling to Europe, Asia and Africa. Angel Ure\u00f1a, the spokesperson, said the trips included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation, and staff, foundation supporters and Clinton's Secret Service detail were on every leg of every trip. Clinton also had a meeting with Epstein in 2002 and made \"one brief visit\" to Epstein's apartment with a staff member and his security detail, Ure\u00f1a said.",
      "In a post on X late Friday, Ure\u00f1a wrote: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing.\"",
      "Trish Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorganChase, said Friday that the federal government \"had damaging information\" about Epstein's crimes and failed to share it with JPMorganChase or other financial institutions.",
      "\"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts,\" she said. \"We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by an unnamed victim of Epstein's on behalf of herself and others that alleged the bank overlooked his sex trafficking and abuse in order to profit from its financial relationship with him. JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to the victims as part of the settlement.",
      "Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn and a major Democratic donor, said in 2019 after Epstein's arrest that he had some interactions with Epstein and regretted participating in fundraising activity with him, according to Axios. Hoffman said in an email to the news outlet that his last interaction with Epstein had been in 2015.",
      "Still, during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October, Bondi attacked Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, for accepting political contributions from Hoffman, who she claimed was \"one of Epstein's closest confidants.\"",
      "In the Justice Department and FBI's\u00a0July memo\u00a0on their review of the Epstein case, they said that while they worked to provide the public with \"maximum information\" about Epstein, they determined \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "The conclusions from the Trump administration sparked immense backlash against Mr. Trump and Bondi from some of the president's supporters, many of whom were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there was nothing further to be released.",
      "Meanwhile, the Oversight Committee has continued to release records as part of its investigation, including court filings, flight records, videos and messages. In September, the panel made public pages from a book compiled by Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, which includes a letter allegedly signed by Mr. Trump and a drawing that appears to be the outline of a woman's body. The president has denied penning the message.",
      "Documents released by the committee show Mr. Trump and Clinton's names are listed under the \"friends\" subheading in the book's table of contents. Clinton appears to have written a handwritten note that reads, in part, \"It's reassuring isn't it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing \u2026 and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friends.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has issued a second pardon to a January 6 defendant who remained imprisoned on separate gun offenses, leading to his release on Friday.",
      "Dan Wilson was one of the supporters of Mr. Trump who breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Justice Department said in a 2024 news release that Wilson was a militia member who entered the building in a gas mask.",
      "He pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer in May 2024 and was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "He was pardoned on that charge in January 2025 when Mr. Trump granted clemency for about 1,500 January 6 defendants.",
      "Despite the pardon, Wilson remained incarcerated. Authorities had searched his home in June 2022 as part of their investigation into his presence at the Capitol.",
      "They recovered \"numerous firearms and ammunition,\" the Justice Department said, which he was forbidden from possessing because of previous felony convictions.",
      "Wilson pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was set to remain in prison until 2028.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump was pardoning Wilson because the home search that led to the discovery of the firearms was part of the investigation into Wilson's January 6 charges.",
      "Wilson's pardon, reviewed by CBS News, was dated to Friday. He was released from prison on Friday evening, his lawyer George Pallas told the Associated Press.",
      "\"For too long, my client has been held as a political prisoner by a government that criminalized dissent,\" Pallas said in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump's pardon rights this wrong and sends a clear message that peaceful Americans will not be persecuted for their beliefs. Mr. Wilson is innocent, he has always been innocent, and this pardon proves it.\"",
      "A sprawling legal battle",
      "Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Mr. Trump's pardon of January 6-related crimes applied to other offenses discovered in investigations related to those charges. Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of the attack and referred to those jailed in connection with it as \"hostages.\"",
      "Wilson planned to participate in the riot at the Capitol for weeks, according to the Justice Department's 2024 news release, and occasionally discussed bringing firearms. He ultimately arrived unarmed.",
      "Throughout the day, he provided information in messaging channels about where people needed support as they worked to enter the Capitol, the Justice Department said. He also spoke to other members of far-right groups, including the Oath Keepers.",
      "The Justice Department initially argued that Trump's pardons did not extend to Wilson's gun charges, but later changed its position, saying that it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who oversaw Wilson's case and was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term, criticized the move and called efforts to extend the pardon to cover offenses discovered in the course of the investigations \"extraordinary,\" according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump also pardoned Suzanne Kaye, a Florida woman who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for threatening to shoot FBI agents. Kaye was questioned by FBI agents after saying online that she had been at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to CBS Miami. When contacted by agents, Kaye denied she had been there, but still agreed to speak with them at her home.",
      "In her video, posted to multiple platforms after that conversation but before her interview, Kaye said she would not talk to the FBI without a lawyer and that she would \"my second amendment right to shoot your f------ ass if you come here,\" according to CBIS Miami. A White House official described Kaye's comments as \"voicing her displeasure with the FBI using curt language,\" and said that it was \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\"",

    "story": [
      "The BBC has issued an apology to President Trump over\u00a0editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021, that aired in its documentary \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" Mr. Trump had threatened to sue the British broadcaster for $1 billion over the program about the Capitol riot, and the BBC noted in a statement Thursday that it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim.",
      "BBC lawyers wrote to Mr. Trump's legal team in response to a letter they received Sunday, the BBC Press Office said. In that letter, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the Oct. 28, 2024, episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of the speech made by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in its statement Thursday. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the press office added.",
      "The White House did not immediately comment on the BBC's apology. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \"We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5 billion, probably sometime next week.\"",
      "The BBC's response to Mr. Trump's legal team laid out five main arguments why the organization believes there is no legitimate case against it, BBC News reported. CBS News has not seen the letter sent by the BBC in reply to Mr. Trump's legal team.",
      "According to BBC News' report, those arguments include that the episode in question did not air in the U.S.; that it did not cause Mr. Trump harm, as he won the election a week later; and that the edits made were intended to shorten a long speech rather than to mislead. It also said that the clip was not meant to be taken in isolation, and that matters of public concern and political speech are protected under U.S. law.",
      "An expert on international media law told CBS News that the BBC's response appears to be \"careful and considered.\"",
      "\"President Trump was clearly owed a fulsome apology and he's had that,\" U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News. \"I don't think he was entitled to damages, and so as a consequence, they've rightly hung tough on that particular issue. But, of course, this has been a massive PR victory for the president. He can now call the BBC 'fake news' ... pointing to some credible background for that.\"",
      "The letter over the weekend from Mr. Trump's lawyers claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law. It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. ET, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"",
      "Stephens told CBS News that while it would be possible for Mr. Trump to pursue a lawsuit against the BBC in the U.S., \"it's got a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true. And they can point to all sorts of previous judicial findings which have said that there was some measure of incitement in which the president was involved.\"",
      "The head of the BBC and its CEO of news resigned in the wake of the criticism of the broadcaster's editing of the speech. The BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness both announced their resignations on Sunday.",
      "In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years \"is entirely my decision.\"",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said, adding that he was \"working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.\"",
      "Turness said that the controversy about the Trump documentary \"has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",
      "\"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\" she added.",

      "President Trump's administration on Friday appealed a ruling from a federal judge in Oregon that barred it from deploying the National Guard to Portland.",
      "The ruling last week from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. The city and state filed the lawsuit in September to block the deployment.",
      "In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to \"great deference\" in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.",

      "Immergut issued two temporary restraining orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump exempted foods like beef, coffee and bananas from his sweeping country-by-country tariffs on Friday, as his administration grapples with cost-of-living frustrations and\u00a0quickly rising prices for some types of food.",
      "The new exemption covers a range of tropical products that are often imported to the United States, including coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, coconuts, pineapples, cocoa and spices such as nutmeg, according to an executive order. It also covers beef, oranges and tomatoes.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump decided to exempt the products on Friday because he's made \"substantial progress\" in negotiating trade deals with other countries. A day earlier, Mr. Trump announced trade frameworks with four Latin American countries \u2014 Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador \u2014 that included relief for food that isn't widely produced in the U.S.",
      "The food products will no longer be covered by the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on most U.S. trading partners, which range from 10% to 40% or more. Some types of food could still be impacted by other forms of tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday the tariff exemptions should cause prices to go down, and they mostly applied to food that is \"not competitive in this country,\" like bananas.",
      "\"We don't make them in this country, so there's no protection of our industries or our food products,\" he said aboard Air Force One.",
      "The moves come as polls show that voters remain nervous about inflation and wary of Mr. Trump's approach to the issue, which helped propel him back to the White House last year.",
      "Food prices rose 3.1% in the yearlong period ending in September, well below its peak of 11.4% in 2022, according to federal data. But certain types of food have surged: Beef prices were up 12.9% year-over-year in September, banana prices were up 6.9% and roasted coffee 18.9%.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted\u00a0costs are actually down since he took over from former President Joe Biden, and has long denied that higher tariffs could push up consumer prices \u2014 a persistent fear raised by economists.",
      "But rising beef prices have alarmed Mr. Trump, who accused foreign-owned meat packing companies earlier this month of \"driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.\"",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said he's considering importing more beef from Argentina to help get prices down. It's a delicate issue, though, because boosting beef imports could upset U.S.-based ranchers, who are typically supportive of the president. Trade groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association publicly criticized the idea.",
      "Mr. Trump responded on Truth Social that ranchers \"have to get their prices down.\"",
      "\"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" he wrote. \"If it weren't for me, they would be doing just as they've done for the past 20 years \u2014 Terrible!\"",

      "A photographer captured images on Friday that show a demolition site in place of the White House's East Wing, which was torn down last month and is set to be replaced by a 90,000-square-foot ballroom championed by President Trump.",
      "The photos \u2014 taken by Andrew Leyden at the top of the Washington Monument, which recently reopened after the government shutdown ended \u2014 show the site that once housed the East Wing is now mostly clear of debris, which was hauled away starting last month.",
      "The East Wing was first built in 1902 and renovated in 1942. Its sudden demolition has drawn controversy, with critics arguing it was done without enough public input and questioning the design plans for the $300 million, donor-funded ballroom. Mr. Trump had initially said the ballroom project \"won't interfere with the current building.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the move and called the criticism \"manufactured outrage,\" pointing out that other presidents have modified the White House complex and arguing that the ballroom will be a useful addition to a building with few large event spaces.",
      "A White House official said last month\u00a0that the administration will submit plans for the ballroom to the National Capital Planning Commission, a board that oversees federal construction in the D.C. area. But the official noted the commission usually isn't involved in demolitions.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chairman of the Senate health committee, says \"we're absolutely in communication with the White House\" about a plan to bring down the cost of health care for Americans.",
      "He told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview airing Sunday he's aiming to have a proposal ready for a vote that is set to take place in mid-December.",
      "Tax credits for about 22 million Americans who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace were at the center of the government shutdown that ended Wednesday. A Biden-era expansion of those subsidies is expiring at the end of the year, so unless they're extended, many consumers will likely face far higher insurance premiums.",
      "Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but they eventually settled for the promise of a vote next month on extending the enhanced tax credits.",
      "Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said of any plan to extend the subsidies, \"Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies.\"",
      "Instead, he's asking Republican and Democratic colleagues to collaborate on lowering health insurance premiums and directly giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA.",
      "\"We can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles,\" Cassidy told Brennan. He said he's telling Democrats, \"Let's not be Democrats and Republicans \u2014 let's be Americans, representing all of Americans.\"",
      "President Trump offered a similar idea last weekend, writing on Truth Social the money that's spent on health insurance subsidies should be \"SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE.\"",
      "Brennan pressed Cassidy on extending the expanded tax credits, which were created in 2021 and are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Noting the approximately 293,000 Louisianans currently enrolled in Obamacare, Brennan asked, \"Are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that they should make plans no for higher prices?\"",
      "Cassidy countered that the problem with the plans was that many of them have high deductibles, with some reaching $6,000 in out-of-pocket costs. The lower-premium \"bronze\" plans on the ACA's marketplaces often have high deductibles.",
      "\"Margaret, I'm a doctor,\" Cassidy said. \"I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, 'I can't afford that. My deductible is too high.' That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion.\"",

    "summary": "Lawyers for James Comey and Letitia James argued their indictments should be dismissed because the appointment of the interim U.S. attorney in Virginia was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Alexandria, Va. \u2014 Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James faced off against the Justice Department Thursday before a federal judge, arguing the indictments against them should be dismissed because the appointment of the interim U.S. attorney who brought both cases is unlawful.",
      "Soon after James' arraignment, the court decided to consolidate the arguments for dismissal. Legal teams for both Comey and James argued that Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid and unconstitutional.",
      "The hearing before U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie lasted more than an hour, and the judge said she planned to issue an order before Thanksgiving. Comey was present for the proceeding.",
      "Henry Whitaker, a Justice Department lawyer, told the court that questions about whether Halligan was properly appointed are an effort by Comey and James to \"elevate at best what is a paperwork error,\" and shouldn't doom the indictments against them. He said that under a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies, the attorney general has the power to appoint a person to fill that role temporarily for 120 days, and each new appointment triggers its own 120-day clock.",
      "But Ephraim McDowell, who argued on behalf of Comey, said that Halligan's role in the indictment against his client is a \"fundamental defect,\" and he argued that the Senate's advise-and-consent function in approving a president's nominees for U.S. attorney posts around the country \"would be eviscerated\" if Currie sides with the Justice Department. The Trump administration, he said, is attempting an \"end run\" around the Senate's confirmation process.",
      "McDowell noted that Halligan was the sole prosecutor who presented the cases against both Comey and James to grand juries, and only Halligan's signature is on both indictments. He argued that the charges against Comey must be dismissed if Currie finds Halligan's appointment was invalid, and allowing the case to continue poses a threat to the \"fundamental integrity\" of the grand-jury process.",
      "Dismissing the case, and not allowing the Justice Department to file new criminal charges, would \"deter and not reward\" the government for violating the Constitution's Appointments Clause and federal law.",
      "After a review of grand jury proceedings in both cases, Currie said that \"all the evidence\" in her review of the case \"is that Ms. Halligan acted alone\" in securing the indictments.",
      "Currie also questioned the government about what she said was a missing portion of the transcript from the grand jury proceedings and suggested that Attorney General Pam Bondi could not have reviewed the grand-jury proceedings as the attorney general said she had. Currie said that part covers 4:28 p.m. to when the indictment was returned on Sept. 25. It is not clear exactly how long that time period was, but brief proceedings before a U.S. magistrate judge that followed the grand jury's vote to indict Comey began at 6:47 p.m. according to a transcript obtained by CBS News.",
      "The judge said it appears no court reporter was present during that part of Halligan's presentation, so Bondi \"couldn't have\" reviewed all of the material. If a court reporter was in the room, she didn't transcribe that portion, Currie said.",
      "How could the attorney general have ratified Halligan's actions before the grand jury and say she looked at the materials \"when they didn't exist\" in the Justice Department's records, the judge asked.",
      "Whitaker told Currie that Bondi had reviewed the \"material facts.\"",
      "Halligan said in a declaration filed with the court Friday that the missing portion of the transcript raised by Currie reflects the period when the grand jury was deliberating, which must be done without any other person in the room, including a court reporter.",
      "\"There are no missing minutes, contrary to the suggestion raised by the court,\" she said.",
      "Halligan laid out the timeline of proceedings, telling the court that the process of presenting the indictment took place from roughly 2:18 p.m. to 4:28 p.m. Roughly two hours later, her then-deputy notified her that the grand jury had voted to indict Comey on two counts, and rejected a third, according to Halligan.",
      "\"During the intermediary time, between concluding my presentation and being notified of the grand jury's return, I had no interaction whatsoever with any members of the grand jury. This time represents the grand jury's private deliberation which was done in secret with no one but the members of the grand jury present, consistent with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure,\" Halligan wrote. \"I was never present in front of the grand jury alone. At every moment I was in front of the grand jury, the court reporter was also present.\"",
      "The criminal cases against Comey and James",
      "Halligan was named to the post days after Erik Siebert resigned as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia amid pressure from President Trump to bring prosecutions against his political foes. Just before Siebert's resignation, sources had told CBS News that prosecutors from the district were concerned he could be removed for not prosecuting James.",
      "Halligan, a former Trump defense lawyer who later joined him in his second administration, was tapped as interim U.S. attorney in September after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump in the White House. Halligan, who was previously an insurance lawyer, took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria with no prosecutorial experience. Mr. Trump nominated her for U.S. attorney in late September.",
      "Comey was indicted in September on one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave five years ago. Comey pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "James was indicted last month on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution and pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department alleges James bought a house in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020 with a mortgage that required her to use it as a second home, but instead ultimately rented it to a family and used it as an investment property. The department accuses James of misrepresenting how the house would be used, so she could obtain a lower interest rate.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Halligan presented evidence to the Comey and James grand juries alone, rather than with the line prosecutors who had worked on the cases. She was also the only attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to sign the indictments. After Halligan became that district's interim U.S. attorney, several prosecutors left the office or were fired.",
      "Since the indictments, lawyers from U.S. Attorneys' Offices in North Carolina and Missouri have joined Halligan in working on the cases involving Comey and James, respectively.",
      "Bondi has used a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies to appoint Halligan and several others around the country as the top federal prosecutors in their respective offices. The law limits the term for an interim U.S. attorney to 120 days, after which the district court in that area can either extend that official's term or appoint a new U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "In the case of the Eastern District of Virginia, Bondi tapped Siebert as interim U.S. attorney in January and ahead of the 120-day deadline in May, judges of that region voted to keep Siebert in the post. Siebert had also been nominated for the permanent position.",
      "He left the position in September, and though Siebert said he resigned, Mr. Trump wrote on social media, in a Sept. 20 post directed at Bondi, that he had ousted Siebert and praised Halligan as a \"really good lawyer.\" Halligan was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney days later.",
      "Halligan and the 120-day term for interim U.S. attorneys",
      "At the heart of the argument was the 120-day term for interim U.S. attorneys appointed by the attorney general. Comey's lawyers said the clock for a temporary U.S. attorney in Virginia has already wound down, and they assert that the law sets a total 120-day time limit that is tied to the attorney general's initial appointment of an interim U.S. attorney \u2014 which would be Bondi's selection of Siebert in January.",
      "\"The period does not start anew once the 120-day period expires or if a substitute interim U.S. Attorney is appointed before the 120-day period expires,\" they wrote in filings.",
      "Allowing the attorney general to make back-to-back sequential appointments would effectively allow the president to circumvent Senate confirmation and the district court's role, Comey's lawyers wrote in court papers.",
      "Halligan \"was defectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney,\" they said. Arguing that \"no properly appointed\" official from the executive branch had obtained the indictment against Comey, his lawyers said \"the indictment is equally a nullity\" and should be dismissed.",
      "Comey's legal team cited in court papers a 2024 decision from a federal judge in South Florida dismissing criminal charges against Mr. Trump that were brought by then-special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was overseeing the case against the president, ruled that the appointment of Smith violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause, and said dismissal of the indictment was the \"only appropriate solution.\"",
      "Mr. Trump faced 40 charges stemming from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House at the end of his first term. The case ended after he won a second presidential term in November 2024.",
      "In their filing, Comey's lawyers wrote that in the case against Mr. Trump, the court dismissed the indictment \"on Appointments Clause grounds because of a defect in the appointment of the prosecutor who secured the charges.\"",
      "\"Here, the court should dismiss the indictment because of Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment,\" they wrote. \"When Ms. Halligan secured and signed the indictment in this case, she was exercising power that she 'did not lawfully possess.'\"",
      "James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, is seeking a court order that would block Halligan from supervising the prosecution of James' case and from exercising any other duties as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Halligan, he wrote, \"had no authority to litigate this case on behalf of the United States.\"",
      "\"[B]ecause this indictment would not have been sought or obtained absent Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment \u2026 the indictment's flaws cannot be brushed aside as harmless error,\" Lowell wrote. \"This Court must reject the Executive Branch's brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\"",
      "The Justice Department's arguments",
      "The Justice Department responded to the motions from Comey and James by arguing that Mr. Trump and Bondi have the authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney after a previous interim pick has already served the 120-day maximum.",
      "The department said that even if the judge overseeing the challenges sides with Comey and James, Bondi has retroactively appointed Halligan as special attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, which would allow her to conduct criminal and civil proceedings in the district.",
      "The Justice Department submitted to the court an order from Bondi, dated Oct. 31, in which she says she is ratifying Halligan's actions before the grand juries and her signature on indictments returned by the grand jury in both cases, and appoints Halligan special attorney for the Justice Department as of Sept. 22.",
      "\"Even were Ms. Halligan's appointment invalid, the motions to dismiss should be denied,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote. \"While Defendants challenge Ms. Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. Attorney, the actions they challenge do not hinge on her validly holding that particular office.\" The Justice Department also argued that \"any government attorney can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment.\"",
      "\"At minimum, any dismissal should be without prejudice to permit the government to seek new indictments now that the Attorney General has cured any arguable flaw in Ms. Halligan's authority to prosecute,\" the Justice Department continued.",
      "They also argued that each appointment to interim U.S. attorney triggers its own 120-day term.",
      "But Lowell argued that if Currie accepts the Justice Department's arguments that Bondi is able to retroactively ratify indictments pursued by lawyers named special attorneys after-the-fact, \"even a person like Steve Bannon or Elon Musk could have brought the indictment and then the attorney general could ratify after.\"",
      "How courts have ruled so far on legality of other temporary U.S. attorney appointments in Trump's second term",
      "The Trump administration has run into issues in other courts that have considered the legality of temporary U.S. attorney appointments during Mr. Trump's second term. In cases involving Alina Habba, the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, and Sigal Chattah, Nevada's acting U.S. attorney, two judges each ruled they are serving unlawfully. A federal judge in California also issued a similar ruling for the acting U.S. attorney in the Central District of California, Bill Essayli.",
      "In the challenge to Habba's appointment, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann wrote that under federal law, the attorney general can make appointments of different people to serve as interim U.S. attorneys, \"but for an aggregate term of 120 days.\"",
      "The Justice Department has appealed the decisions involving Habba and Chattah.",
      "Federal judge from South Carolina presides over arguments",
      "Currie, from South Carolina, presided over Thursday's arguments. She was brought into the case because all of the federal judges in the Eastern District of Virginia have a conflict of interest in hearing the arguments because of Halligan's role as head of the prosecutor's office in the district.",
      "Currie was appointed to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton in 1994.",
      "Earlier this month, Currie said in an order that a transcript she requested from prosecutors from Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey was incomplete, and \"fails to include remarks made by the indictment signer both before and after the testimony of the sole witness, which remarks were referenced by the indictment signer during the witness's testimony.\"",
      "After the grand jury indictment was returned, a federal magistrate judge expressed confusion and surprise after she received two versions of the indictment.",
      "A majority of the grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court. He was indicted on two other counts \u2014 making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding \u2014 after 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor of them, the foreperson told the judge.",
      "But two versions of the indictment were published on the case docket: one with the dropped third count, and one without. The transcript reveals why this occurred.",
      "\"So this has never happened before. I've been handed two documents that are in the Mr. Comey case that are inconsistent with one another,\" the magistrate judge said to Halligan. \"There seems to be a discrepancy. They're both signed by the (grand jury) foreperson.\"",

      "Maurene Comey is suing the Justice Department, alleging that her sudden firing in July was illegal and \"politically motivated\" given her father James Comey's longstanding criticism of President Trump, who fired the older Comey as FBI director in 2017.",
      "On Thursday, a lawyer from the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of New York informed a federal judge she would represent the Justice Department in the lawsuit, according to a court document \u2014 marking the first formal appearance by an attorney for the government since the case was filed in September.",
      "The lawyer, Karen Folster Lesperance, explained in a letter that the Northern District \u2014 located in Albany \u2014 agreed to take on the case last month because of the Manhattan-based Southern District's recusal. She asked for an extension of next week's deadline to respond to the case, which she said Maurene Comey's attorneys had agreed to.",
      "\"While we are working diligently to familiarize ourselves with this matter and prepare the government's response, additional time is needed to draft an anticipated motion to dismiss and consult with Department officials as necessary,\" Lesperance wrote..",
      "She also said most members of her office's civil division were furloughed due to the government shutdown and didn't return to the office until Thursday.",
      "The letter doesn't specify why the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York recused itself. But Maurene Comey had served as a prosecutor in that office for years, working on the high-profile prosecutions of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father also led the office in the early 2000s.",
      "Maurene Comey was let go in July. She said in a note to colleagues obtained by CBS News that she was \"summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination.\"",
      "Two months later, she sued the government over the termination, calling it illegal and arguing she was unconstitutionally punished because her father has clashed with Mr. Trump for years. She asked a federal judge to declare her firing unlawful and order the Justice Department to let her return to her job with back pay.",
      "Separately, her father, James Comey, was criminally charged in September for allegedly lying to Congress. His lawyers have pushed for the charges to be dropped, calling them vindictive and driven by Mr. Trump's \"personal animus.\"",

    "summary": "Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has referred California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell to the Justice Department, sources told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Trump administration official has referred California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell to the Justice Department over alleged tax and mortgage fraud, sources told CBS News.",
      "The official, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, has leveled similar accusations against several other officials, including Democrats New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Sen. Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.",
      "James was indicted on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution last month and pleaded not guilty. James' attorneys have argued the case is politically motivated, saying the administration is targeting her for her role in bringing civil fraud charges against President Trump in New York.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August after Pulte accused her of making misrepresentations on mortgage documents. But Cook filed a lawsuit arguing her removal was unlawful, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments in January on whether Mr. Trump can fire her from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "The allegations against Swalwell are connected to a property in Washington, D.C., the sources said. The Justice Department had no comment. NBC News first reported the referral.",
      "In a statement, Swalwell delivered an appeal to President Trump to \"do better. Be better.\"",
      "\"As the most vocal critic of Donald Trump over the last decade and as the only person who still has a surviving lawsuit against him, the only thing I am surprised about is that it took him this long to come after me,\" he said in a statement. \"Like James Comey and John Bolton, Adam Schiff and Lisa Cook, Letitia James and the dozens more to come \u2014 I refuse to live in fear in what was once the freest country in the world.\"",
      "Swalwell filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump in March 2021 over his actions relating to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. In the suit, the California Democrat accuses the president of inciting the violence at the Capitol with his tweets and speech outside the White House on the morning of Jan. 6, in violation of federal civil rights laws and D.C. law. The case has continued to move forward in the federal district court in Washington.",
      "Swalwell said in his statement that he would not end his lawsuit against the president.",
      "\"And I will not stop speaking out against the president and speaking up for Californians,\" he continued.",
      "Swalwell has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump and served as an impeachment manager during Mr. Trump's second impeachment trial, which stemmed from the Jan. 6 attack. He confirmed to CBS News in June that he took out a liability insurance policy to protect himself due to concerns of potential legal risk during Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries defended Swalwell as a \"principled legislator\" and called the referral \"laughable.\"",
      "\"Bill Pulte is nothing more than a malignant hack who is abdicating his responsibility to help everyday Americans afford a home, and is instead wasting taxpayer dollars on baseless investigations into Donald Trump's perceived political enemies,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"Pulte knows what he is doing is lawless, which is why he fired the Acting Inspector General and Fannie Mae ethics officers who were investigating whether he was inappropriately accessing the mortgage details of Democratic officials.\"",

    "summary": "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene an\u00a0ally during the shutdown for joining Democrats in demanding that Congress address high health care costs.",
    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

Marjorie Taylor Greene said Friday that President Trump's opposition to releasing files from the federal investigation into convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein is a \"huge miscalculation.\" In an exclusive interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" Greene said she doesn't believe the president has anything to hide, noting that some of Epstein's victims have said Mr. Trump \"has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Greene, of Georgia, was among the four House Republicans who joined all Democrats in signing on to a discharge petition that forces a vote in the House on a measure compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to its probe into Epstein. The vote is expected next week.",
      "Mr. Trump has slammed the focus on Epstein as a \"hoax\" pushed by Democrats to deflect the blame for the government shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history and ended Wednesday.",
      "\"Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,\" he wrote on Truth Social on Friday. \"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem! Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Sommers about Epstein, they know all about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"",
      "A few hours later, he posted again, calling for the Justice Department and FBI to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "But Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" she doesn't understand Mr. Trump's opposition to releasing the material related to Epstein.",
      "\"I think it's a huge miscalculation, and I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she said.",
      "Greene said she has spoken with many of Epstein's victims, and the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "\"I believe the women and the women have said over and over again that Donald Trump did nothing wrong,\" she said. \"Even Virginia Giuffre said it under oath and she wrote it in her book. And so if we listen to the women, they say Donald Trump has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Giuffre, the most high-profile of Epstein's accusers, died by suicide in April. She said she was approached by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell and hired to give Epstein massages in 2000, just before she turned 17. At the time, Giuffre was\u00a0working at the spa at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre wrote in her memoir that she met Mr. Trump once at Mar-a-Lago, and said he \"couldn't have been friendlier.\"",
      "Separate from the effort to push the Justice Department to release its files on Epstein, the GOP-led House Oversight and Reform Committee has been investigating the federal government's handling of the investigation into Epstein and\u00a0Maxwell.",
      "This week the panel released more than 20,000 pages of records it received from Epstein's estate, which include text and email exchanges with the disgraced financier that reference Mr. Trump.",
      "In one email from Epstein to author Michael Wolff in January 2019, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referencing Mr. Trump.",
      "In another email from Epstein to Maxwell in April 2011, he wrote, \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "The emails and text messages released by the Oversight panel, on which Greene sits, provide a look into Epstein's contacts with high-profile people. Among them are Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump; Kathryn Ruemmler, a top executive at Goldman Sachs who served as White House counsel to former President Barack Obama; and an array of figures in business, entertainment and academia.",
      "Green said the documents offer the public a \"very interesting view into a world that most of us have never seen.\"",
      "\"It's kind of like a web of global affairs, business connections, very high and powerful people, foreign leaders,\" she said. \"And it's just an interesting world. And even the Intel community.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004.",
      "State and federal authorities investigated Epstein between 2005 and 2006. In late 2007, federal prosecutors reached a deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid federal charges in exchange for pleading guilty to two state prostitution charges and serving an 18-month prison sentence. He ended up serving less than 13 months and was released in 2009.",

      "The leader of the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia says that he will step in to replace Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in the Georgia election interference case against President Trump and others.",
      "PAC Executive Director Peter J. Skandalakis made the announcement on Friday, which was the deadline set\u00a0by the judge overseeing the case to find Willis's replacement.",
      "In his announcement, Skandalakis said that he will take up the case after his organization was unable to find another prosecutor by Friday.",
      "\"Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment,\" he wrote. \"Out of respect for their privacy and professional discretion, I will not identify those prosecutors or disclose.\"",
      "Skandalakis said that he chose to lead the prosecution due to his familiarity with some of the immense case file, which he described as more than 100 banker boxes of documents and an 8-terabyte hard drive. Though he attempted to examine the evidence and interviews in the time the judge allotted him, he said he was not able to complete a full review.",
      "\"With Judge McAfee's deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case,\" Skandalakis wrote. \"This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed.\"",
      "With Skandalakis as the prosecutor, he now has the choice whether to continue the path Willis had taken, pursue only some charges, or dismiss the case entirely.",
      "While it is unlikely that any action against Mr. Trump could proceed while he is the sitting president, there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, attorney Steve Sadow, who is representing Mr. Trump in the case, said that the \"politically charged prosecution has come to an end.\"",
      "\"We remain confident that a fair and impartial review will lead to a dismissal of the case against President Trump,\" Sadow said.",
      "How Georgia's Trump election case began",
      "Willis announced the indictment against Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using Georgia's anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow 2020 election loss to Joe Biden in Georgia.",
      "The alleged plot included Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, urging him to \"find\" enough votes to reverse the outcome. Four defendants: attorneys Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro, and bail bondsman Scott Hall have pleaded guilty.",
      "Willis was disqualified from prosecuting the case after revelations that she had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to lead the investigation.",
      "Defense attorneys alleged that Willis and Wade benefited from their relationship, saying Wade used his earnings from the case to pay for trips they took together. Willis and Wade acknowledged the relationship but said it began after he was hired.",
      "In March 2024, Judge McAfee rebuked Willis for a \"tremendous lapse in judgment\" but said there was no conflict of interest that would disqualify her. He ruled she could stay on the case if Wade resigned, which he did hours later.",
      "The defense attorneys appealed, and in December, the Georgia Court of Appeals removed Willis from the case, citing an \"appearance of impropriety.\" The state's high court declined to hear Willis' appeal in September, placing the case in the hands of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council.",
      "While Trump\u00a0announced pardons\u00a0for people accused of backing his efforts to overturn the results of that election earlier this week \u2014 including those charged in Georgia \u2014 that doesn't affect state charges.",

      "Jeffrey Epstein's private emails and text messages, among the more than 20,000 documents released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee, provide a glimpse into his relationships with people who formed part of his inner circle during his final years. And they repeatedly touched on President Trump.",
      "Epstein increasingly turned to close Trump ally Steve Bannon, journalist Michael Wolff and lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler as his reputation cratered and his status among the world's most powerful shrank in the years before his 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell. Ruemmler at the time was a partner at the law firm Latham & Watkins and had served as White House counsel during the Obama administration. She is now the chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs.",
      "The emails show they often talked with Epstein about Mr. Trump, an old friend from New York and Florida, who has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years earlier. Mr. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing. Epstein, in return, often sought advice or sounding boards for some of his most important personal projects, ranging from deals in the Middle East to his goal of reviving his shattered reputation through a documentary with Bannon.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a post on his social media site, raged against Congressional Democrats who on Wednesday seized upon a 2019 email in which Epstein wrote Mr. Trump \"knew about the girls\" \u2014 an allegation that Mr. Trump has forcefully and consistently denied for years.",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the federal government shutdown that ended Wednesday.",
      "Epstein and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon",
      "There were hundreds of texts and emails between Bannon and Epstein covering a wide range of topics, including the Middle East, possible business deals and several conversations on how Epstein should portray himself in the media.",
      "Several of their interactions include disparaging remarks about Mr. Trump, with one text saying the president is the \"worst negotiator in human history.\"",
      "In one exchange from June 28, 2019 \u2014 just a week before Epstein's arrest \u2014 he wrote to Bannon, \"Now you can understand why Trump wakes up in the middle of the night sweating when he hears you and I are friends.\"",
      "Bannon was a key player in Epstein's longshot effort to rehabilitate his reputation. Bannon filmed hours of interviews with Epstein as part of a planned documentary, saying in a 2018 text, \"I'd like to do a documentary on the real story.\" Epstein answered, \"yes, great idea.\" A source who was close to Epstein told CBS News he planned a public relations campaign aimed at portraying himself in a redemptive light.",
      "Several media projects focused on Epstein were in development at the time, and emails show Bannon and Epstein discussing filmmakers for their documentary after learning Netflix was making a competitor film. The existence of the film about Epstein, called \"Filthy Rich,\" by director Joe Berlinger, was brought to their attention by well-known publicist Peggy Siegal.",
      "In one exchange, Bannon said the film Epstein had in mind sounds like a \"potential hagiography,\" referring to works that chronicle the lives of saintly figures.",
      "They then considered other possible directors to enlist for the project, which was never released.",
      "The last exchange between Bannon and Epstein was on July 6, 2019, the day Epstein was arrested at Teterboro airport on sex trafficking charges by federal agents. Epstein and Bannon started texting early that morning, making plans for filming their future documentary. At one point, Bannon texted Epstein,\"If we can arrange it can we film on the island?\" Epstein responded \"yes.\" Hours later, Epstein texted Bannon, \"Can we do late morning, say 11. Am?\"",
      "\"You r not coming in?\" Bannon wrote to Epstein at 4:37 p.m. that day. There was no reply.",
      "About two hours later, Epstein was arrested.",
      "Epstein and author Michael Wolff",
      "Wolff, a prolific profiler of the rich and powerful who had penned several bestselling books about Mr. Trump and his administration, provided a nexus between Epstein, the president and other powerful people.",
      "One day in November 2018, Wolff wrote to Epstein that he planned to meet with Bannon the next afternoon while working on a forthcoming project.",
      "\"I was thinking of opening with you and Bannon talking about Trump,\" Wolff wrote. \"Would let you sound smart and offer what I think would be a crowd-pleasing perspective, and make you seem like a credible player--former friend of Trump, advisor to world leaders, sought after person, etc--without having too much rehash of old stuff.\"",
      "The duo frequently discussed Mr. Trump, with Epstein shooting the journalist emails that included one asking why reporters hadn't interviewed the president's former classmates at the Wharton School of Business.",
      "He then referred to a lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump challenging a congressional subpoena of his banking records. Epstein described the records as \"very bery bad.\"",
      "Epstein also forwarded an email to Wolff that he had originally sent to Kathryn Ruemmler describing his view of the way Mr. Trump set up his business deals. Epstein wrote, \"Donald doesn't really own very much, he rents out his name.\"",
      "Epstein sought out and cultivated relationships with powerful and famous people for decades, portraying himself as a bridge to connect the world's elite. In 2018, he introduced Wolff to former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who had led investigations against Bill and Hillary Clinton and had also been part of Epstein's legal team.",
      "Starr, who two years earlier resigned as chancellor of Baylor University amid criticism of the school's handling of student sexual assault claims, responded to Epstein's introductory email, thanking him and telling Wolff he was \"delighted\" to be in his \"orbit.\" Starr died in 2022.",
      "Wolff's outreach to Starr came as he was working on a book about Mr. Trump's legal troubles. Epstein had thoughts on that, too, forwarding in January 2019 an email he had sent to Ruemmler alleging financial schemes tied to Trump properties.",
      "In an appearance Wednesday night on a Daily Beast podcast, Wolff said Epstein and Trump had a \"deep relationship\" and shared an obsession with \"women, girls, models.\"",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement that Wolff \"routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.\"",
      "Epstein and attorney Kathryn Ruemmler",
      "Ruemmler, now a Goldman Sachs executive, was a partner at the law firm Latham & Watkins during the last years of Epstein's life. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs told CBS News in October that Ruemmler's cultivation of Epstein was related to her work for the law firm.",
      "\"As we've said before, and has been repeatedly reported, Ms. Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Mr. Epstein when she was the global chair of the white collar defense and investigations practice at Latham & Watkins,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, he sent a text to Bannon describing a pitch for a news article that would support Epstein's reputation effort. Epstein referred to the pitch as a \"Ruemmler proposal,\" and the idea for the article was to address criticism of a 2008 agreement in which Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state charge of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18 \u2014 and a federal case was closed.",
      "\"Far from\u2026receiving a sweetheart deal, Mr. Epstein was subject to a lengthy, aggressive and highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local offenses of sexual solicitation,\" Epstein wrote, describing the \"proposal.\"",
      "In Epstein's communications with Ruemmler, he also dropped hints that he had dirt on the president. One email chain, discussing a 2018 New York Times opinion column on impeachment, included a tantalizing Epstein quip.",
      "\"You see, I know how dirty Donald is,\" Epstein wrote.",
      "\"My guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. what it means to have your fixer flip,\" he continued \u2014 a reference to Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" who ended up cooperating with investigations into his ex-boss.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday released emails exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "Among the documents is a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted. In another email in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"",
      "Maxwell\u00a0was convicted of conspiring in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Wolff has written several books about Mr. Trump.",
      "House Democrats said the emails were turned over by Epstein's estate, which they said released more than 23,000 documents that lawmakers are now reviewing. The full Oversight Committee also released more than 20,000 pages of records from Epstein's estate Wednesday and claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the material \"to generate clickbait.\" The latest batch includes emails, records from court proceedings, transcripts from depositions, press clippings and other material.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. She said the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17,\u00a0while working at the spa\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April,\u00a0had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"",
      "CBS has not independently verified the emails.",
      "In one of the messages from Epstein to Maxwell, dated April 2, 2011, the late financier wrote, \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. [Victim 1] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "Maxwell then replies, \"I have been thinking about that\u2026\"",
      "In a second email that appears to be from Epstein to Wolff, dated Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein references a victim, whose name is redacted, and mentions Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida resort.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" the message from Epstein reads.",
      "In the third exchange released by House Democrats, which appears to be between Epstein and Wolff, Wolff writes on Dec. 15, 2015, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you\u2013either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"",
      "According to the email exchange, Epstein then replies, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Wolff responds, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his first run for the White House in June 2015 and would have been on the campaign trail when the emails between Wolff and Epstein were exchanged.",
      "Wolff authored a book about the first few months of Mr. Trump's first term in office, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" that was released in 2018.",
      "In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Wolff acknowledged there were email exchanges between him and Epstein, and said \"perhaps we're getting close to the smoking gun\" between Epstein and Mr. Trump.",
      "Wolff also spoke on the Daily Beast podcast about his correspondence with Epstein, saying there were recorded conversations between them. \"I've discussed many, many places, there are hours and hours, upwards of 100 hours of Jeffrey Epstein talking about many things, but many hours of him talking about Donald Trump and his relationship to Donald Trump,\" Wolff said.",
      "White House spokesperson Steven Cheung on Thursday said Wolff \"routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein were friends for years and ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004, more than a decade before Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.",
      "Epstein had separately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2008, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "Epstein died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",
      "Congress to vote on release of more Epstein files",
      "The new release comes amid a push for more transparency on the Epstein files in Congress.",
      "The newest House member, Democrat Adelita Grijalva, was sworn in Wednesday after a 7-week delay, becoming the final signature needed on a discharge petition to circumvent House GOP leaders and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files from its investigation into Epstein. Speaker Mike Johnson said it would be brought to a vote on the House floor next week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0on social media Wednesday that the \"Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects. Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.\"",
      "\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\" the president wrote.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department in a statement Wednesday to make the Epstein files public \"immediately,\" pledging that the panel \"will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\"",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia said. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"",
      "Several tranches of records have been turned over to congressional investigators, including from Epstein's estate. The House Oversight Committee has also sought information from a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Lawmakers have also questioned Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in South Florida when prosecutors investigated Epstein in the 2000s and reached the nonprosecution agreement with him.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as Labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of Epstein's case.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 18:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton of Arkansas told CBS News the threat is \"severe and growing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Unauthorized drone flights over U.S. military installations, border facilities and mass public events are climbing to unprecedented levels, prompting warnings from top lawmakers that the country faces an escalating aerial security risk while it remains hamstrung by a patchwork of airspace protection capabilities.",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said in an interview with CBS News this week that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing.\" He cited evidence of persistent drone incursions and gaps in law enforcement authorities, many of which lapsed for weeks during the record-long government shutdown.",
      "There were more than 350 unauthorized drone flights over about 100 military installations in 2024, according to the Defense Department, and government data shows there were more than 27,000 drones detected within 500 meters of the U.S. southern border in the last half of that year.",
      "And while the number of stadium incursions waned slightly last year, the overall trend is continuing to move upward, according to NFL data, with drone incursions almost doubling, from 1,300 to 2,300, between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Some of the incursions may be the fault of hobbyists or unwitting individuals, Cotton said, but inexpensive drone technologies have also proliferated across criminal organizations and non-state actors, raising the risks of mass-casualty attacks.",
      "\"It could be\u2026unwittingly probing to see what the responses are \u2013 and responses have not been particularly strong, given these legal limitations,\" he said of some drone overflights of sensitive U.S. military installations. Citing classification concerns, Cotton, who also sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, declined to comment on how many overflights may have a connection to a foreign government, or which foreign governments may be involved.",
      "U.S. security officials have previously issued public warnings that drone incursions near military bases, energy facilities and other critical infrastructure pose surveillance risks. Many of them may be traced to foreign-made or unidentified systems capable of collecting imagery or signals intelligence. The threat underscores legal holes in detection and authority as drone activity increasingly probes sensitive American airspace \u2013 potentially, some officials have warned, in preparation for kinetic attacks.",
      "The coordinated drone strikes by Ukraine deep inside Russian territory on June 1 - known as Operation Spider's Web \u2014 showed in dramatic fashion how relatively inexpensive unmanned systems can reach far-flung military targets. The operation reportedly deployed 117 drones to strike more than 40 Russian aircraft and caused approximately $7 billion in damage.",
      "This example has been widely cited in U.S. security policy circles as a harbinger of how drone overflights or strikes might one day be carried out against U.S. or allied installations if defenses are not modernized, and authorities are not made more coherent.",
      "Defense officials say many U.S. military bases, for example, aren't authorized under current law to deploy defensive counter-drone systems. In February, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of both U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, testified that only about half of U.S. military installations qualify as \"covered\" sites, which are authorized to intercept drones that pose security threats.",
      "And while a handful of federal entities \u2014 including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Energy and Justice \u2014 are currently authorized to detect, track, or disable drones, state and local agencies remain largely powerless even when drones threaten civilian sites, including airports or stadiums.",
      "Cotton pointed to the rise in drone activity over major sporting venues as evidence of the broader vulnerability of civilian targets, with heightened risks expected around the Olympics and World Cup \u2013 both set to be hosted by the U.S. next year.",
      "A sports industry security official confirmed in a phone interview with CBS News that the threat to civilian targets at mass gatherings from drone overflights is \"real and it's increasing.\"",
      "\"The vast majority are the clueless or the careless,\" the official said, referring to drone operators who ignore or misunderstand temporary flight restrictions over stadiums and arenas. \"But there are also cases where the drone operator has acted very aggressively and evaded detection,\" the official said, estimating there are about \"a dozen\" such cases each year.",
      "\"Thankfully, just by luck, we haven't had something bad happen \u2014 whether an accident where somebody crashes their drone into fans, or whether they weaponize a drone and drop something dangerous into a stadium,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security considerations.",
      "While no mass-casualty or payload-delivery plot targeting a U.S. sporting event has ever been publicly confirmed, security officials say that the volume and frequency of incursions make it more plausible.",
      "Cotton, along with bipartisan co-sponsors, is backing two measures aimed at closing enforcement gaps. The first, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada, is the DEFENSE Act, which would allow trained state and local law enforcement officers to detect, track and disable hostile drones at large public gatherings. The second measure, the COUNTER Act, is co-sponsored by New York Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand and expands the definition of a covered site to allow more American bases to track and neutralize drones.",
      "If Congress does not act urgently to match its laws to the evolving threat, Cotton warned, the U.S. may find it's reacting after a catastrophic event, rather than being prepared before one occurs. And while the federal government is now funded through January 30, the next major funding showdown is already looming.",
      "That means critical airspace protection authorities \"remain in place until the end of January \u2013 a week before the Super Bowl is going to be played,\" Cotton said.\u00a0 \"I think we should try to make those authorities permanent, not just so it's not hostage to government funding anymore, but so DHS, working with other federal agencies, can be more certain in what it can plan for and train for.\"",

    "summary": "With the government shutdown finally in the rearview mirror, the focus in the Senate is turning to an upcoming fight over health care.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 With the government shutdown finally in the rearview mirror, the focus in the Senate is turning to an upcoming fight over health care, with Democrats hoping to regroup after splintering in the final stages of the showdown.",
      "Eight Senate Democrats broke ranks to reach a deal with Republicans to end the shutdown, dashing the party's effort to win an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits in return for their vote to reopen the government. Now, Democrats face a quick timeline to shift their strategy.",
      "As part of the deal, Democrats secured a promise to hold a vote next month on the tax credits, which help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges. And while Democrats have pledged to continue the fight, exactly what that looks like, and whether it could find enough support to pass, remains to be seen.",
      "\"What we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters earlier this week. \"So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "Reaching consensus on health care",
      "Senate Democrats must now weigh their approach. With the promise of a vote on legislation of their choosing, they have an opportunity to try to chart a bipartisan path forward, with the option of forcing Republicans to take a politically perilous vote if a deal fails to materialize.",
      "In recent days, Democrats have said they see signs of bipartisan interest in addressing health care costs. A handful of moderate Republicans have expressed openness to a tax-credit extension, albeit with some reforms. Any bill would need 60 votes to pass in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, said on Monday that she's \"talked to so many of my Republican colleagues who want to do something here \u2014 who want to keep health care costs down for their constituents.\" But when Baldwin sought to amend the funding package to include a one-year extension of the ACA tax credits, the vote didn't pick up GOP support. Days earlier, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits, Republicans likewise rejected the offer.",
      "But with the shutdown behind them, Republicans have expressed willingness to negotiate on the health care issue. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters this week that he sees a bipartisan path forward, noting that any extension of the tax credits \"obviously \u2026 can't be without reforms.\"",
      "\"But my expectation is at some point, the president is going to be very inclined to want to do something to make health care more affordable in this country,\" Thune said. \"So if there is a willingness on the part of Democrats to work with Republicans to deal with the unaffordability of Obamacare in its current form, then there might be an opportunity to do something bipartisan.\"",
      "Thune has said that a number of Republicans are already engaged in conversations on the health care issue or have a high level of interest. He pointed to Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, a physician, as someone with expertise on the issue, along with Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Rick Scott of Florida, who lead the relevant committees.",
      "\"So there are a number of them that have already started to work on some things, and there are already some discussions going on with folks on the other side of the aisle about what might be a path forward,\" Thune said. \"We'll see where it lands.\"",
      "Similarly, Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said she supports an extension of the ACA tax credits, \"but they need reform,\" she said, citing specifically a need for caps on the income of those who are eligible for them.",
      "Collins said there are other ideas that have been raised by Republicans on reforming the ACA to make health insurance more affordable, pointing to pledges from Crapo and Cassidy to hold hearings on the issue and Thune's commitment to bring up a vote.",
      "But other parts of the conference seem to be eyeing a different approach.",
      "A Republican split",
      "The efforts to find bipartisan consensus on the tax credits were complicated by President Trump's criticism of the Affordable Care Act in recent days. He urged Republicans to take bolder action by overhauling Obamacare and redirect funds from insurance companies straight to the American people.",
      "Republicans have heavily criticized the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But last weekend, following a flurry of posts from the president on Truth Social, a number of GOP senators spent hours railing against the Affordable Care Act on the Senate floor, while some expressed support for broader changes to the health insurance industry.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of the president, touted Mr. Trump's call to overhaul Obamacare over the weekend, congratulating the president for getting \"into the game,\" saying \"he's given us a pathway forward. I am going to heed his advice and counsel.\"",
      "Graham said Mr. Trump would \"like to sit down and see if we can come up with a better solution.\"",
      "Democrats pledge to continue the fight",
      "Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House, where a compromise would likely face stronger headwinds.",
      "And some Senate Democrats have appeared less positive about a bipartisan solution, though they pledged to continue the fight to lower health care costs.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington criticized Republicans for refusing an offer from Democrats for a one-year extension of the ACA tax credits on Monday, saying it's \"truly the most straightforward and common-sense thing we can do for people facing gigantic premium hikes this year.\"",
      "\"Republicans have gone from saying nothing about health care costs all year long to saying 'later, later, later,' even after we are over a week into open enrollment, and wasting every bit of time we had for real negotiations,\" Murray said. \"Then, incredibly, Republicans started saying, let's scrap the Affordable Care Act altogether.\"",
      "Still, she insisted that \"this fight is not over \u2014 far from it \u2014 because I and many of us have no intention of letting Republicans off the hook.\"",
      "\"The reality is, there is a point where it will be too late to make a meaningful difference,\" Murray said. \"But until we reach that point of no return, we do have to fight tooth and nail to force Republicans to actually work with us on that issue.\"",
      "Schumer likewise pledged to keep up the fight on health care, saying it \"will and must continue.\"",
      "\"We will not give up this fight,\" Schumer said. \"We will deliver for the American people.\"",
      "Jaala  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-birth-control-study-science/",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "summary": "Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, plans to challenge SpaceX with the powerful, partially reusable New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket Thursday, putting two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The centerpiece of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos' space ambitions, the towering 321-foot-tall New Glenn rocket's seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust.",
      "The launch came three days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space, where a powerful solar storm buffeted Earth's atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.",
      "The storm had abated by launch time Wednesday, and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast.",
      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother, Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

      "By day, a row of plain-looking sheds in sleepy Rockwood, Texas, looks like nothing more than a place to store farm tools and feed. But when the sun dips below the horizon, their roofs peel back in unison to reveal a hidden network of hundreds of telescopes.",

      "The night sky has gotten harder to see due to a 10% yearly increase in light pollution over the past decade, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Science.",
      "Starfront's customers live all over the world, including Europe, Asia and the Middle East, Falls said.",
      "Chuck Ayoub in suburban Detroit has a garage full of telescopes, but he hardly uses them anymore after shipping one out to Texas.",
      "\"The big difference are the dark skies. I am 20 minutes from downtown Detroit, and that light pollution is a killer,\" Ayoub said.",
      "Most nights, Ayoub livestreams his telescope feed to his large social media following. There's also a small camera at the base so he can see his telescope in action.",
      "From the Starfront property, Falls and others are identifying celestial objects no one has ever seen before, such as a photo he calls the \"Crown of Thorns\" nebula. The discoveries are furthering our understanding of space, even as our ability to see it is fading.",

    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",
      "Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights\u00a0being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:31:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",

      "It's become nearly impossible for people to tell the difference between music generated by artificial intelligence and that created by humans, according to a survey released Wednesday.",
      "The polling firm Ipsos asked 9,000 people to listen to two clips of AI-generated music and one of human-made music in a survey conducted for France-based streaming platform Deezer.",
      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",
      "The survey was conducted between October 6 and 10 in eight countries: Brazil, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States.",
      "Deezer said more than half of the respondents felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.",
      "Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51 percent saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it will lead to a loss of creativity.",
      "\"The survey results clearly show that people care about music and want to know if they're listening to AI or human made tracks or not,\" Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a statement.",
      "Deezer said there's not only been a surge in AI-generated content being uploaded to its platform, but it's attracting listeners as well.",
      "In January, one in 10 of the tracks streamed each day were completely AI-generated. Ten months later, that percentage has climbed to over one in three, or nearly 40,000 per day.",
      "Eighty percent of survey respondents wanted fully AI-generated music clearly labelled for listeners.",
      "Deezer is the only major music-streaming platform that systematically labels completely AI-generated content for users.",
      "The issue gained prominence in June when a band called The Velvet Sundown suddenly went viral on Spotify and only confirmed the following month that it was in fact AI-generated content.",
      "The AI group's most popular song has been streamed more than three million times.",

    "summary": "Google said the fake messages are part of a massive criminal network called \"Lighthouse\" that has stolen information through phishing and smishing scams.",
    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to dispatch scores of Border Patrol agents to Charlotte and New Orleans to oversee immigration enforcement operations that could involve armored vehicles and special operations teams, according to internal government documents and U.S. officials.",
      "Internal DHS preparations reviewed by CBS News listed Charlotte and New Orleans as the next targets of President Trump's mass deportation campaign. Like in\u00a0Chicago\u00a0and\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 which have seen highly visible and often controversial federal immigration arrests in recent months \u2014 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents are expected to play a lead role in the operations in Charlotte and New Orleans.",
      "The planned Border Patrol operation in Charlotte, where an operations center is being stood up, is expected to start soon, as early as next week, two sources familiar with the plans told CBS News.",
      "Garry McFadden, the sheriff of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, said Thursday he had been \"contacted by two separate federal o\ufb03cials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week.\"",
      "Border Patrol's focus is then expected to shift to New Orleans, where as many as 200 CBP agents could be deployed, according to the sources and internal DHS documents.",
      "Armored vehicles, including so-called \"BearCats,\" have been requested for both Charlotte and New Orleans, alongside special operations agents, the internal documents show. Internally, officials have dubbed the plans \"Charlotte Web\" and \"Catahoula Crunch,\" references to the children's novel and the official state dog of Louisiana, respectively.",
      "Many of the Border Patrol agents deployed to the Chicago region earlier this fall, including outspoken commander Gregory Bovino, are expected to participate in the upcoming operations in Charlotte and New Orleans, two U.S. officials said. CBS News was\u00a0first to report\u00a0last week that Bovino and most Border Patrol agents would be leaving Chicago, and that they could be redirected to locations like Charlotte.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed it is \"surging\" agents to Charlotte.",
      "\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. \"There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens, and President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said, \"Public safety is the top priority for all of us in government \u2014 that means fighting crime, not stoking fear or causing division.\"",
      "\"We should all focus on arresting violent criminals and drug traffickers. Unfortunately, that's not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,\" Stein said, noting that many of those detained there had\u00a0no criminal convictions.",
      "He urged North Carolinians \"to remember our values,\" follow the law and remain peaceful. And he added, \"If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement.\"",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Saturday in a joint statement with other local officials, the expected Border Patrol operations are \"causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community, as\u00a0previous operations in other cities like Chicago\u00a0\"have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.\"",
      "The latest plans illustrate the Trump administration's continued reliance on Border Patrol agents to carry out its sweeping, nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "While Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency charged with enforcing U.S. immigration laws in the interior of the country, the Trump administration has deployed teams of Border Patrol agents to Chicago, Los Angeles and other places far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings plunged to a 55-year low in fiscal year 2025.",
      "In both Chicago and Los Angeles, the operations by Border Patrol agents, in many cases personally led by Bovino, have come under scrutiny, sparking protests and tense confrontations with local residents who have denounced the agency's actions as overly aggressive.",
      "ICE officers and Border Patrol agents are all federal immigration officials with the same legal authority to arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally. But their operations typically differ in style and nature.",
      "While ICE has also aggressively expanded immigration enforcement across the country under Mr. Trump, its arrests continue to be, to a large extent, targeted operations driven by intelligence gathering and prior surveillance that typically target people in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes.",
      "In Chicago and Los Angeles, on the other hand, Border Patrol agents have conducted \"roving\" operations that are more indiscriminate in nature, targeting places like Home Depot parking lots and worksites that they believe are frequented by people who don't have legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The use of force that Border Patrol has employed against protesters has also come under withering criticism, including from a federal judge in Chicago who imposed drastic limits on the ability for agents to deploy tear gas and crowd control tactics. Trump administration officials maintain agents have used the necessary force, citing instances of civilians interfering with operations or turning to violence.",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0last month.",

      "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody early Saturday on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
      "\"The Miami Beach Police Department remains steadfast in its commitment to maintain public safety and order throughout the city\u2014regardless of celebrity status,\" the agency said. \"The Department will continue to take proactive enforcement action against behavior that endangers residents, visitors, or officers and will hold all individuals accountable under the law.\"",
      "According to his bio on Delka Talents, his talent agency, Doherty has over 3.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 500 million YouTube views. Doherty is best known for filming \"daredevil\" stunts and pranks, and his most-watched video has over 18 million views as of March 2018, his bio said.",
      "CBS News Miami has reached out to Doherty's representatives for comment on his arrest.",
      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

    "summary": "President Trump accused Democrats of using what he calls the \"Epstein hoax\" to defect blame for the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's involvement with prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, and major financial institutions.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump accused Democrats of focusing on what he calls the \"Epstein hoax\" to deflect blame for the government shutdown, which ended Wednesday and was the longest in U.S. history.",
      "\"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" the president wrote. \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi soon said she had asked Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation. Clayton's office covers matters from Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as the counties north of New York City.",
      "\"As with all matters, the Department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people,\" she wrote on X.",
      "The announcement comes four months after the Justice Department and FBI\u00a0said in a July memo\u00a0that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of material related to Epstein and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" They also said there was no \"client list\" or \"credible evidence\" that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement comes as the House is expected to vote next week on a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files from its investigation into Epstein. The president opposes the release of that material and has accused Republicans who backed the effort to force a vote on the proposal of being \"soft and foolish.\" GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday that she believes the president's stance on the Epstein files is a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "When asked about the vote on Saturday, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't care about it released or not.\"",
      "\"What I think you should do if you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.",
      "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into the federal government's handling of its probe into Epstein, released earlier this week more than 20,000 pages of material it obtained from Epstein's estate.",
      "Among the records are emails and messages exchanged with Epstein that mention Mr. Trump. In one email from Epstein to author Michael Wolff in January 2019, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referencing Mr. Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's. It's unclear what Epstein was referring to.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "In another email from Epstein to Maxwell in April 2011, he wrote, \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "The president has not been accused of wrongdoing. While he and Epstein ran in the same social circles in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, from the late 1980s to early 2000s, Mr. Trump has said the two had a falling out around 2004 and had not spoken in the years leading up to Epstein's 2019 death.",
      "He died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility after he was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges.",
      "The latest release from the Oversight Committee also shows that Epstein corresponded regularly with Summers, who was treasury secretary during Clinton's presidency and led the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported in 2023 on Epstein's contacts with Summers. A spokesperson for Summers said at the time that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction.\" Epstein was investigated with federal and state officials between 2005 and 2006. Under a deal reached with federal prosecutors in 2007, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month sentence to avoid federal charges. He served less than 13 months and was released in 2009.",
      "As part of its review, the House Oversight panel issued a subpoena to Clinton in August for testimony because of his past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said in 2019 after Epstein was indicted that the former president took four trips on Epstein's plane in 2002 and 2003, traveling to Europe, Asia and Africa. Angel Ure\u00f1a, the spokesperson, said the trips included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation, and staff, foundation supporters and Clinton's Secret Service detail were on every leg of every trip. Clinton also had a meeting with Epstein in 2002 and made \"one brief visit\" to Epstein's apartment with a staff member and his security detail, Ure\u00f1a said.",
      "In a post on X late Friday, Ure\u00f1a wrote: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing.\"",
      "Trish Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorganChase, said Friday that the federal government \"had damaging information\" about Epstein's crimes and failed to share it with JPMorganChase or other financial institutions.",
      "\"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts,\" she said. \"We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by an unnamed victim of Epstein's on behalf of herself and others that alleged the bank overlooked his sex trafficking and abuse in order to profit from its financial relationship with him. JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to the victims as part of the settlement.",
      "Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn and a major Democratic donor, said in 2019 after Epstein's arrest that he had some interactions with Epstein and regretted participating in fundraising activity with him, according to Axios. Hoffman said in an email to the news outlet that his last interaction with Epstein had been in 2015.",
      "Still, during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October, Bondi attacked Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, for accepting political contributions from Hoffman, who she claimed was \"one of Epstein's closest confidants.\"",
      "In the Justice Department and FBI's\u00a0July memo\u00a0on their review of the Epstein case, they said that while they worked to provide the public with \"maximum information\" about Epstein, they determined \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "The conclusions from the Trump administration sparked immense backlash against Mr. Trump and Bondi from some of the president's supporters, many of whom were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there was nothing further to be released.",
      "Meanwhile, the Oversight Committee has continued to release records as part of its investigation, including court filings, flight records, videos and messages. In September, the panel made public pages from a book compiled by Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, which includes a letter allegedly signed by Mr. Trump and a drawing that appears to be the outline of a woman's body. The president has denied penning the message.",
      "Documents released by the committee show Mr. Trump and Clinton's names are listed under the \"friends\" subheading in the book's table of contents. Clinton appears to have written a handwritten note that reads, in part, \"It's reassuring isn't it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing \u2026 and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friends.\"",

      "President Trump has issued a second pardon to a January 6 defendant who remained imprisoned on separate gun offenses, leading to his release on Friday.",
      "Dan Wilson was one of the supporters of Mr. Trump who breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Justice Department said in a 2024 news release that Wilson was a militia member who entered the building in a gas mask.",
      "He pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer in May 2024 and was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "He was pardoned on that charge in January 2025 when Mr. Trump granted clemency for about 1,500 January 6 defendants.",
      "Despite the pardon, Wilson remained incarcerated. Authorities had searched his home in June 2022 as part of their investigation into his presence at the Capitol.",
      "They recovered \"numerous firearms and ammunition,\" the Justice Department said, which he was forbidden from possessing because of previous felony convictions.",
      "Wilson pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was set to remain in prison until 2028.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump was pardoning Wilson because the home search that led to the discovery of the firearms was part of the investigation into Wilson's January 6 charges.",
      "Wilson's pardon, reviewed by CBS News, was dated to Friday. He was released from prison on Friday evening, his lawyer George Pallas told the Associated Press.",
      "\"For too long, my client has been held as a political prisoner by a government that criminalized dissent,\" Pallas said in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump's pardon rights this wrong and sends a clear message that peaceful Americans will not be persecuted for their beliefs. Mr. Wilson is innocent, he has always been innocent, and this pardon proves it.\"",
      "A sprawling legal battle",
      "Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Mr. Trump's pardon of January 6-related crimes applied to other offenses discovered in investigations related to those charges. Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of the attack and referred to those jailed in connection with it as \"hostages.\"",
      "Wilson planned to participate in the riot at the Capitol for weeks, according to the Justice Department's 2024 news release, and occasionally discussed bringing firearms. He ultimately arrived unarmed.",
      "Throughout the day, he provided information in messaging channels about where people needed support as they worked to enter the Capitol, the Justice Department said. He also spoke to other members of far-right groups, including the Oath Keepers.",
      "The Justice Department initially argued that Trump's pardons did not extend to Wilson's gun charges, but later changed its position, saying that it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who oversaw Wilson's case and was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term, criticized the move and called efforts to extend the pardon to cover offenses discovered in the course of the investigations \"extraordinary,\" according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump also pardoned Suzanne Kaye, a Florida woman who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for threatening to shoot FBI agents. Kaye was questioned by FBI agents after saying online that she had been at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to CBS Miami. When contacted by agents, Kaye denied she had been there, but still agreed to speak with them at her home.",
      "In her video, posted to multiple platforms after that conversation but before her interview, Kaye said she would not talk to the FBI without a lawyer and that she would \"my second amendment right to shoot your f------ ass if you come here,\" according to CBIS Miami. A White House official described Kaye's comments as \"voicing her displeasure with the FBI using curt language,\" and said that it was \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\"",

    "summary": "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday, ending a blackout for customers that dragged on for about two weeks.",
      "\"As part of the new deal, Disney's full suite of networks and stations \u2013 including ESPN and ABC \u2013 have already begun to be restored to YouTube TV subscribers,\" The Walt Disney Co. said in a statement. \"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football.\"",
      "Disney content had gone dark on YouTube TV the night of Oct. 30, after the two sides failed to reach a new licensing deal. In the days that followed, YouTube TV subscribers were left without Disney channels on the platform \u2014 notably disrupting coverage of top U.S. college football matchups and professional sports games, among other news and entertainment offerings.",
      "Beyond ESPN and ABC, other Disney-owned content removed from YouTube TV during the impasse included channels like NatGeo, FX, Freeform, SEC Network, ACC Network and more.",
      "At the time the carriage dispute reached its boiling point, YouTube TV said that Disney was proposing terms that would be too costly, resulting in higher prices and fewer choices for its subscribers. And the platform accused Disney of using the blackout \"as a negotiating tactic\" \u2014 claiming that the move also benefited Disney's own streaming products like Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.",
      "Disney, meanwhile, said that YouTube TV had refused to pay fair rates for its channels. The California entertainment giant also accused Google of \"using its market dominance to eliminate competition.\" And executives blasted the platform for pulling content \"prior to the midnight expiration\" of their deal last month.",
      "On Nov. 3, Disney also asked YouTube TV to restore ABC programming for Election Day on Nov. 4 to put \"the public interest first.\" But YouTube TV said this temporary reprieve would confuse customers \u2014 and instead proposed that the entertainment giant agree to restore both its ABC and ESPN channels while the two sides continued negotiations.",
      "The blackout marked the latest in a growing list of licensing disputes in today's streaming world. And consumers often pay the price.",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years, as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But amid growing competition, renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations \u2014 and at times service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV and Disney have been down this road before. In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers also briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform after a similar contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, YouTube TV has removed other networks from its platform after expired agreements. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision has been unavailable on YouTube TV since Sept. 30, for example. At the time, its parent company TelevisaUnivision decried Google's move \u2014 noting it would strip \"millions of Hispanic viewers of the Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment they rely on every day\" and called on the platform to reverse course.",
      "YouTube TV's base subscription plan costs $82.99 per month \u2014 which, beyond Disney content, currently includes live TV offerings from networks like NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS and more. The platform previously said it would give subscribers a $20 credit if its dispute with Disney lasted \"an extended period of time\" \u2014 which it reportedly allowed customers to start claiming on Nov. 9.",
      "Disney also doles out live TV through both traditional broadcasting and its own lineup of streaming platforms. ESPN launched its own streamer earlier this year, starting at $29.99 a month. And other Disney content can be found on platforms like Hulu, Disney+ and Fubo. Disney currently allows people to bundle ESPN along with Hulu and Disney+ for $35.99 a month \u2014 or $29.99 a month for the first year.",

      "The altercation on the bus happened after dismissal the day the images were reported, the statement said.",
      "While investigating that incident, \"juvenile detectives and school resource officers discovered A.I. generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults,\" according to the sheriff and superintendent.",
      "One male student was charged a few weeks after the incident for 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence, the sheriff's office said. Additional arrests or charges were possible, the office said.",
      "The male student was never expelled or suspended, but instead transferred to a different school after the incident took place, according to the family's attorney.",
      "\"In investigations involving school incidents, criminal charges can, but do not necessarily, play a factor in disciplinary actions,\" the district said.",
      "The girl was allowed to return to school last week, but she remains on probation until at least January, preventing her from participating in school dances, sports or other extracurricular activities.",
      "Daniels said the expulsion has had a toll on his daughter.",

      "President Trump's administration on Friday appealed a ruling from a federal judge in Oregon that barred it from deploying the National Guard to Portland.",

The city and state filed the lawsuit in September to block the deployment.",
      "In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to \"great deference\" in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.",
      "The administration criticized the decision and said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump has described as \"war ravaged.\"",

      "Immergut issued two temporary restraining orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.",

      "The Trump administration is\u00a0scrapping a proposed Biden-era rule\u00a0that would have made airlines pay customers for long waits when their flights were delayed, according to a document from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "The Transportation Department on Friday\u00a0published a notice that it is officially withdrawing the proposed rule, introduced in 2024 under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The regulation would have required airlines to pay passengers $200 to $300 for domestic delays lasting at least three hours, and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "The agency, which announced in September that it planned to abandon the proposal, said the notice will be published in the Federal Register on Monday. The passenger protection measure would have created \"unnecessary regulatory burdens,\" the Transportation Department said Friday.",
      "In October, a group of Democratic senators defended the regulation in a letter to the Trump administration, calling it a \"common-sense proposal\" that would have held airlines accountable for their mistakes. They noted that delays can place a financial strain on families when they are forced to rebook flights or secure overnight accommodations.",
      "Customers in the U.S. are entitled to refunds for canceled flights, but no similar protections are in place for delays.",
      "The agency on Friday explained its rationale for ditching the measure, saying the move would \"allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.\"",
      "When reached for comment Friday, the Transportation Department told CBS News that the \"Biden-Buttigieg proposal was just that \u2014 a proposal.\"",
      "\"It was dropped after the election in the waning days of the administration. It was never enacted, and does not reflect the compensation consumers are currently entitled to with respect to delays and cancellations,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the hate crime convictions of the three men who chased Ahmaud Arbery through their Georgia subdivision with pickup trucks before one of them killed him with a shotgun. Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, had been jogging in the neighborhood.",
      "A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals took well over a year to rule after attorneys for the defendants urged the judges in March 2024 to overturn the case, arguing the men's history of racist text messages and social media posts failed to prove they targeted Arbery because of his race.",
      "Federal prosecutors used those posts and messages in 2022 to persuade a jury that Arbery's killing was motivated by \"pent-up racial anger.\"",
      "Even if the appeals judges had thrown out their hate crime convictions, the trio faced no immediate reprieve from prison. That's because they're also serving life terms for murder after being convicted in a Georgia state court.",
      "Father and son Greg and Travis McMichael armed themselves and used a pickup truck to pursue 25-year-old Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. A neighbor, William \"Roddie\" Bryan, joined the chase and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range.",
      "More than two months passed without arrests, until Bryan's graphic video of the killing leaked online. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police as outrage over Arbery's death became part of a national outcry over racial injustice. Charges soon followed.",
      "In a November 2021 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, said the guilty verdicts were a \"big victory,\" adding: \"I don't think without that video we would have had any arrests, nevertheless a trial.\"",
      "All three men were convicted of murder by a state court in late 2021. After a second trial in U.S. District Court in early 2022, a jury found the trio guilty of hate crimes and attempted kidnapping.",
      "In her 2021 interview, Cooper-Jones had a message to the three men: \"We finally got justice for Ahmaud. I'm so sorry that your bad decisions made all of my family suffer to this extreme, but it was your decisions that got us here.\"",
      "She noted that his death was the impetus behind a\u00a0hate crime law\u00a0enacted in the state in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers.",
      "Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales.",
      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

    "summary": "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene an\u00a0ally during the shutdown for joining Democrats in demanding that Congress address high health care costs.",
    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said Friday that President Trump's opposition to releasing files from the federal investigation into convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein is a \"huge miscalculation.\" In an exclusive interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" Greene said she doesn't believe the president has anything to hide, noting that some of Epstein's victims have said Mr. Trump \"has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Greene, of Georgia, was among the four House Republicans who joined all Democrats in signing on to a discharge petition that forces a vote in the House on a measure compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to its probe into Epstein. The vote is expected next week.",
      "Mr. Trump has slammed the focus on Epstein as a \"hoax\" pushed by Democrats to deflect the blame for the government shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history and ended Wednesday.",
      "\"Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,\" he wrote on Truth Social on Friday. \"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem! Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Sommers about Epstein, they know all about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"",
      "A few hours later, he posted again, calling for the Justice Department and FBI to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "But Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" she doesn't understand Mr. Trump's opposition to releasing the material related to Epstein.",
      "\"I think it's a huge miscalculation, and I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she said.",
      "Greene said she has spoken with many of Epstein's victims, and the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "\"I believe the women and the women have said over and over again that Donald Trump did nothing wrong,\" she said. \"Even Virginia Giuffre said it under oath and she wrote it in her book. And so if we listen to the women, they say Donald Trump has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Giuffre, the most high-profile of Epstein's accusers, died by suicide in April. She said she was approached by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell and hired to give Epstein massages in 2000, just before she turned 17. At the time, Giuffre was\u00a0working at the spa at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre wrote in her memoir that she met Mr. Trump once at Mar-a-Lago, and said he \"couldn't have been friendlier.\"",
      "Separate from the effort to push the Justice Department to release its files on Epstein, the GOP-led House Oversight and Reform Committee has been investigating the federal government's handling of the investigation into Epstein and\u00a0Maxwell.",
      "This week the panel released more than 20,000 pages of records it received from Epstein's estate, which include text and email exchanges with the disgraced financier that reference Mr. Trump.",
      "In one email from Epstein to author Michael Wolff in January 2019, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referencing Mr. Trump.",
      "In another email from Epstein to Maxwell in April 2011, he wrote, \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "The emails and text messages released by the Oversight panel, on which Greene sits, provide a look into Epstein's contacts with high-profile people. Among them are Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump; Kathryn Ruemmler, a top executive at Goldman Sachs who served as White House counsel to former President Barack Obama; and an array of figures in business, entertainment and academia.",
      "Green said the documents offer the public a \"very interesting view into a world that most of us have never seen.\"",
      "\"It's kind of like a web of global affairs, business connections, very high and powerful people, foreign leaders,\" she said. \"And it's just an interesting world. And even the Intel community.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004.",
      "State and federal authorities investigated Epstein between 2005 and 2006. In late 2007, federal prosecutors reached a deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid federal charges in exchange for pleading guilty to two state prostitution charges and serving an 18-month prison sentence. He ended up serving less than 13 months and was released in 2009.",
      "Epstein was later indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2019 on sex trafficking charges. He died by suicide in a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An extension of enhanced ACA tax credits appears unlikely, experts say, leaving millions of Americans facing potentially higher health plan costs in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of health care remains in limbo for roughly 22 million Americans after the U.S. government reopened late Wednesday without a deal to extend an expiring federal tax credit that offsets the cost of some Affordable Care Act plans.",
      "The fate of the enhanced premium tax credit had been at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history as Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidy in order to reopen the government.",
      "The Senate\u00a0voted late Sunday\u00a0on a deal to end the shutdown that did not resolve the future of the tax credit \u2014 a central demand of Democrats during the government funding fight. On Wednesday, the House approved the Senate-passed funding package to end the 43-day shutdown. President Trump signed the legislation shortly after.",
      "To secure the Democratic votes needed to reopen the government, Senate Republicans\u00a0agreed to hold a separate vote\u00a0on extending the ACA tax credits by mid-December. But a vote isn't guaranteed to succeed, and even if the legislation makes it out of the Senate, House GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Americans are now choosing their 2026 health plans on the ACA's online marketplaces, and without congressional action, the tax credits will expire Dec. 31.",
      "\"A lot of people are sort of in this limbo state where they have to buy their insurance for next year, but they really don't know how this is going to shake out at the federal level,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at nonprofit health policy site KFF, told CBS News.",
      "What happens without an extension?",
      "The subsidies were introduced in 2021 through the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, and then extended for three more years in the Inflation Reduction Act. Without any action on Congress's part, the enhanced premium tax credits will disappear at the end of 2025.",
      "That means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums more than double next year, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF analysis.",
      "Faced with higher costs for ACA insurance, about 4 million people are likely to drop their health coverage, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "\"Americans are really just seeing how expensive health care is in this country, and it's just completely unaffordable for a lot of people to pay their own entire health insurance premium,\" Wager said.",
      "Currently, the enhanced ACA premium tax credit is available for people who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which sets the upper threshold at $62,000 for an individual, according to KFF. However, some Americans who earn above that 400% benchmark can qualify for the tax credit if their insurance rates exceed 8.5% of their income.",
      "Three-quarters of Americans favor renewing the subsidies, according to recent KFF polling. That includes 94% of Democrats and about half of Republicans.",
      "If Congress renews the subsidies, federal and state marketplaces would need to retool the 2026 plans already available to consumers. It's possible a new plan could be made retroactive to January 2026, even if it's passed later in the year, Wager said.",
      "\"At that point, people are sort of locked in on whatever plan they chose, but they can retroactively receive the tax credit,\" she noted.",
      "Are there other options from Congress?",
      "Congress could pursue other ways to make health coverage more affordable. On Saturday, President Trump called for sending the money saved by not extending the tax subsidies \"directly to the people.\" On his Truth Social platform, he criticized the ACA and said Americans should be able to use the savings to purchase other kinds of insurance.",
      "\"In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare,\" he wrote.",
      "Wager said it remains to be seen if Mr. Trump's plan is feasible, saying \"we haven't seen a concrete enough proposal at this point.\"",
      "Some lawmakers have offered similar proposals, such as Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. In a floor speech last week, he said eligible Americans could be sent \"a pre-funded federal flexible spending account\" to use for health expenses, from dental care to prescription drugs and preventive services.",
      "In the meantime, as 2026 approaches and the future of the enhanced premium tax credit remains unclear, enrollees should consider speaking with a health insurance expert to get advice on their options, Wager advised.",
      "\"The most important thing that you can do is talk to somebody \u2014 an agent, broker or a navigator \u2014 who can help you make sure that you really understand what your options are and that you get the best plan for your financial situation and your health care situation,\" she said.",

      "\"I've just got to figure out how to keep living. And the hard part with that is not knowing why,\" Edwards said of his wife's death.",
      "Despite local, state, and federal safety campaigns, such as the global Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, such deaths are up 20% in the U.S. from a decade ago, from 32,744 in 2014 to an estimated 39,345 in 2024, according to data from the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Although traffic deaths have declined since peaking at 43,230 in 2021, the number of deaths remains higher than a decade ago.",

      "\"Every day, 20 people go out for a walk, and they don't return home,\" said Adam Snider, a spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state road safety offices.",
      "American roads have become more dangerous than violent crimes in some cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston are among the major cities that now report more traffic fatalities than homicides. In 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department reported an estimated 268 homicides and 302 traffic deaths, the second consecutive year that the number of people killed in collisions exceeded the number of homicide victims, according to Crosstown LA, a nonprofit community news outlet.",

Even before Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the alliance appealed to the president-elect in a letter to support consumer choice.",

      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

Global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024, the\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed.",
      "Many of the protesters reveled in the freedom to demonstrate more openly than at recent climate talks\u00a0held in more authoritarian countries, including Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Thousands of people joined in a procession that sprawled across most of the march's route.",

      "Japan raised objections Saturday after China advised its citizens to avoid visiting Japan, as a feud over the new Japanese leader's remarks on Taiwan showed no signs of dying down.",
      "The government in Tokyo lodged a protest and its top spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, urged China to take \"appropriate measures,\" Japan's Kyodo News Service reported.",
      "China advised its citizens Friday to refrain from traveling to Japan in the near future. It cited earlier attacks against Chinese in Japan and what it called Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 's \"erroneous remarks\" on Taiwan, which it said undermined the atmosphere for China-Japan\u00a0exchange.",
      "Kihara told reporters that it is precisely because of the differences between the two governments that multilayered communication is essential, a Kyodo report said.",
      "China has repeatedly recommended its nationals take security precautions when in Japan over the past year, but the latest announcement appeared to be stronger in advising against travel, according to notices posted on the website of its embassy in Tokyo.",
      "Japan is an immensely popular destination for Chinese tourists, providing a much-needed economic boost but also sparking an anti-China and anti-foreigner backlash from some. It's unclear what impact the advisory will have on the willingness of Chinese to visit Japan, but several Chinese airlines\u00a0offered no-penalty refunds on previously sold tickets to Japan following the government's announcement.",
      "The dispute suggests that Japan's already fragile relations with China could turn rocky under Takaichi, who supports building up the military to counter potential threats from Beijing and its claims to contested territory in nearby waters in the western Pacific.",
      "Takaichi, who became prime minister last month, said in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute \"an existential threat\" to Japan, requiring the use of force by its military.",
      "The remark prompted strong objections from China, including a social media post from its consul general in Osaka last weekend saying \"we have no choice but to cut off that dirty neck that has been lunged at us.\"",
      "His comment, which was later taken down, sparked a Japanese diplomatic protest that was followed by a back-and-forth that continued all week.",
      "China claims Taiwan, a self-governing island off its coast, as its territory and has staged threatening military drills in the surrounding waters in recent years.",
      "Neither the United States nor Japan has official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but the U.S. is the main supplier of defense equipment to the island's military and opposes resolution of the China-Taiwan situation by force.",

    "summary": "The Vatican has returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada.",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada as part of the Catholic Church's reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas.",
      "Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops during an audience. According to a joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church, the pieces were a gift and a \"concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\"",
      "The items were part of the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens. The Vatican insists the items were \"gifts\" to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church's global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government's\u00a0forced assimilation policy\u00a0of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \"cultural genocide.\"",
      "Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections.",
      "Negotiations accelerate on returning items",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in running Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including an Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \"In the case where you can return things, where it's necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\"",
      "The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome.",
      "\"This is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\" said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church.",
      "It added that the Canadian Catholic hierarchy committed to ensuring that the artifacts are \"properly safeguarded, respected and preserved.\" Officials had previously said the Canadian bishops would receive the artifacts with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities themselves.",
      "The items are expected to be taken first to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. There, experts and Indigenous groups will try to identify where the items originated, down to the specific community, and what should be done with them, officials said previously.",
      "A process of reckoning with abuses",
      "The Canadian ambassador to the Holy See, Joyce Napier, said the return had been a key priority for the Canadian government, something the embassy has been working on for years with the Holy See, Canadian church and Indigenous communities.",
      "\"This is historic, something Indigenous communities have been asking for,\" she told The Associated Press. \"Today's announcement is a significant step towards reconciliation.\"",
      "As part of its broader reckoning with the Catholic Church's colonial past, the Vatican in 2023 formally repudiated the \"Doctrine of Discovery,\" the theories backed by 15th-century \"papal bulls\" that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands that form the basis of some property laws today.",
      "The statement marked a historic recognition of the Vatican's own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers, even though it didn't address Indigenous demands that the Vatican formally rescind the papal bulls themselves.",
      "The Vatican on Saturday cited the 2023 repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery in its statement, saying Leo's return of the artifacts concludes the \"journey\" initiated by Francis.",

      "A report by the official Irna news agency carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard that said the tanker was taken to Iranian waters. It did not elaborate on the \"illegal consignment,\" the crew or say where the ship was now heading.",
      "It said the seizure came following a court order and the operation was aimed at \"protecting Iran's national interests and resources.\" It identified the oil tanker as the Talara and said it was carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemical products.",
      "The seizure happened on Friday. Tehran has been increasingly warning it could strike back after a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "It said the ship had been en route to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats.",
      "A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday, observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed.",
      "The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible \"state activity\" forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters.",
      "Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement later said in a statement that it had \"lost contact\" with the tanker, which was carrying high sulphur gasoil. It did not immediately provide any update on Saturday.",
      "Iran has been blamed for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after U.S. President Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "In 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and held them until November of that year. Iran seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.",

    "summary": "A cache of confiscated explosives detonated inside the station, according to police. The region's police director-general said the incident was an accident.",
    "story": [
      "A cache of confiscated explosives detonated inside a police station in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing at least nine people and injuring 32 others, police said on Saturday.",
      "The blast occurred in the Nowgam area of Srinagar, the region's main city, late Friday when a team of forensic experts and police were examining the explosive material, said Nalin Prabhat, the region's police director-general. He ruled out any foul play, saying it was an accident.",
      "The dead included six police and forensic officials, two civil administrators and one civilian, authorities said. Some of the injured were in critical condition.",
      "The huge blast ripped through the police station, setting it and multiple vehicles on fire. According to the news agency Press Trust of India, small successive explosions prevented immediate rescue operations.",
      "The police station blast came days after Monday's deadly car explosion in New Delhi, which killed at least eight people near the city's historic Red Fort. Indian officials called it a \"heinous terror incident\" carried out by \"anti-national forces.\" The car blast happened hours after police in Kashmir said they had dismantled a suspected militant cell operating from the disputed region, arresting at least seven people, including two doctors from Indian cities, and seizing a large quantity of bomb-making material in the city of Faridabad, near New Delhi.",
      "Indian security agencies have since carried out a series of raids in Kashmir as part of their investigation into the car blast, questioning hundreds while detaining scores others.",
      "Indian police said Saturday they used DNA to identify the car's driver and that he was a Kashmiri doctor. Government forces blew up his family home in the southern district of Pulwama on Thursday night, officials said.",
      "In the past, troops have demolished homes of suspects they accuse of being tied to militants fighting against Indian administration in Kashmir as a punishment.",
      "Police had brought the explosive material seized in Faridabad to Kashmir as part of their investigation and were \"kept securely in an open area\" at the police station, where the investigation that led to the suspected militant cell began last month, according to Prabhat, the top officer.",
      "Prabhat said a team of experts was taking samples for forensic investigation when the blast occurred, calling it an \"accidental explosion.\"",
      "\"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" he said.",
      "The blast could be heard from miles away in Srinagar, locals said. Some of the victims' body parts were recovered from nearby houses, over 300 feet away from the police station. Multiple houses also suffered damage.",
      "\"The explosion produced a deafening roar that rattled houses and flung open windows closed tight,\" Bashir Ahmed, a resident, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nearly a dozen relatives of Mohammad Shafi Parray, killed in the blast, assembled at his home in Nowgam and marched in protest to the police station, chanting: \"We want justice.\"",
      "One of Parry's relatives, who didn't give her name, said the deceased, a tailor by profession, was summoned by the police Friday night. \"Why did (the police) take him?\" she shouted.",
      "A local police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said the tailor had been called to the station to stitch bags for storing explosive material samples.",
      "India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety.",
      "Militants in the Indian-administered portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's administration since 1989. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle.",

    "summary": "President Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
    "story": [
      "The BBC has issued an apology to President Trump over\u00a0editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021, that aired in its documentary \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" Mr. Trump had threatened to sue the British broadcaster for $1 billion over the program about the Capitol riot, and the BBC noted in a statement Thursday that it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim.",
      "BBC lawyers wrote to Mr. Trump's legal team in response to a letter they received Sunday, the BBC Press Office said. In that letter, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the Oct. 28, 2024, episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of the speech made by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in its statement Thursday. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the press office added.",
      "The White House did not immediately comment on the BBC's apology. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \"We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5 billion, probably sometime next week.\"",
      "The BBC's response to Mr. Trump's legal team laid out five main arguments why the organization believes there is no legitimate case against it, BBC News reported. CBS News has not seen the letter sent by the BBC in reply to Mr. Trump's legal team.",
      "According to BBC News' report, those arguments include that the episode in question did not air in the U.S.; that it did not cause Mr. Trump harm, as he won the election a week later; and that the edits made were intended to shorten a long speech rather than to mislead. It also said that the clip was not meant to be taken in isolation, and that matters of public concern and political speech are protected under U.S. law.",
      "An expert on international media law told CBS News that the BBC's response appears to be \"careful and considered.\"",
      "\"President Trump was clearly owed a fulsome apology and he's had that,\" U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News. \"I don't think he was entitled to damages, and so as a consequence, they've rightly hung tough on that particular issue. But, of course, this has been a massive PR victory for the president. He can now call the BBC 'fake news' ... pointing to some credible background for that.\"",
      "The letter over the weekend from Mr. Trump's lawyers claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law. It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. ET, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"",
      "Stephens told CBS News that while it would be possible for Mr. Trump to pursue a lawsuit against the BBC in the U.S., \"it's got a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true. And they can point to all sorts of previous judicial findings which have said that there was some measure of incitement in which the president was involved.\"",
      "The head of the BBC and its CEO of news resigned in the wake of the criticism of the broadcaster's editing of the speech. The BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness both announced their resignations on Sunday.",
      "In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years \"is entirely my decision.\"",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said, adding that he was \"working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.\"",
      "Turness said that the controversy about the Trump documentary \"has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",
      "\"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\" she added.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",

      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

      "Luis Rubiales was pelted by eggs thrown by his own uncle when the former head of Spain's soccer federation was presenting a memoir late Thursday relating his downfall after kissing a player at the 2023 Women's World Cup.",
      "Rubiales was seated on a stool on a low stage when he jumped up and spun quickly trying to avoid three eggs hurled his way. One impacted on the back of his dark jacket, and another splattered against a screen behind him as he charged into the small audience.",
      "\"A man entered who I later saw was my uncle, who is a troubled man, and always has been,\" Rubiales told reporters. \"He had some eggs and threw some at me, but I didn't know what he had in his hands, and when I first saw him I thought he might be carrying a weapon.\"",
      "Spanish media reported that the uncle was Luis Rub\u00e9n Rubiales, an actor who has appeared in several domestic television shows.",
      "Spanish police told The Associated Press they arrested the egg thrower. No motive was immediately given for the incident. A video shows a group of men in the audience grabbing the uncle immediately after he launched the eggs and escorting him away.",
      "Rubiales also had a falling out with another uncle, Juan Rubiales, several years ago when Juan was working for him at the federation.",
      "His book \"Matar a Rubiales\" (Killing Rubiales) is a 500-page version of his professional demise after kissing Spain forward Jenni Hermoso during the 2023 Women's World Cup awards ceremony. It was the first time Spain's women's team took home the title. \u00a0According to its publisher, Rubiales says he was the victim of a \"conspiracy of different powers of Spanish public life\" including the government and \"the profitable world of feminism.\"",
      "Rubiales has always denied he kissed Hermoso without her consent. After initially clinging to power amid a national uproar, he stepped down under immense pressure from the government, soccer officials, women players and fans.",
      "Earlier this year he was found guilty of sexual assault for the unsolicited kiss by a Spanish court. He was fined over $11,000 and ordered not to come within 650 feet of Hermoso or contact her for a year. Prosecutors had pushed for him to spend over two years in prison. Rubiales was acquitted of a separate charge that alleged he and other officials pressued Hermoso to support him in the aftermath of the kiss.",
      "Hermoso testified in court that Rubiales' actions \"tarnished\" what should have been \"one of the happiest days\" of her life.",
      "\"I'd spent years fighting to win titles for my team, like the World Cup,\" she said. \"But all that's happened to me means that I just haven't been able to enjoy any of it from the moment I set foot back in Madrid.

    "summary": "The State Department said U.S. citizens in Japan should exercise increased caution amid a sharp rise in deadly bear attacks.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. State Department is warning Americans in Japan to be alert as bear attacks and sightings rise in parts of the country.",
      "Americans should avoid areas where bears are sighted, especially if walking alone, and be aware of their surroundings, the State Department said in a \"wildlife alert\" Wednesday. Anyone who spots a bear should report it to local authorities.",
      "Bears have killed at least 13 people in Japan since April, more than double the five people killed in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, AFP reported. It's the largest number of people killed by bears in Japan since the country began keeping such records in 2006. More than 100 other people have sustained injuries since April, according to Environment Ministry statistics from the end of October.",
      "Most of the attacks have occurred in northern Japan. In its alert, the State Department called out the Hokkaido and Akita Prefectures, as well as Sapporo City, where officials closed a park next to the U.S. Consulate General after a bear was sighted there.",
      "Troops were recently deployed to Akita to contain the animals there. Some police have been authorized to shoot the animals, AFP reported.",
      "U.S. citizens should register for the Smart-Traveler Enrollment Program, which makes it easier to receive security messages from the State Department and allows Americans to be located more easily in case of an emergency, the State Department said.",
      "The State Department regularly issues warnings, and every country in the world has been given a designated travel advisory. Japan's\u00a0travel advisory level remains at 1, meaning travelers should \"exercise normal precautions.\" But it's rare for U.S. officials to warn about wildlife in a foreign country. The State Department did not immediately respond to a query asking how many such warnings have been issued.",
      "Bears have been spotted near schools, in supermarkets and even near Iwate Hanamaki Airport. Experts say the country's\u00a0aging and declining rural population\u00a0has contributed to the problem. As Japan's population shrinks, humans leave rural areas and bears move in.",
      "\"Then that area recovered to the forest, so bears have a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Older local hunters are also not used to bear hunting, and few preventative measures have been taken in recent years. Climate change has also\u00a0affected the bears' hibernation schedules and impacted foods the animals depend on.",
      "Japan has two types of bear: Asian black bears found throughout the country's mainland \u2014 also known as moon bears \u2014 and the bigger brown bears that live on the main northern island of Hokkaido. Brown bears can weigh over 1,100 pounds and outrun humans. Asian black bears are climbers and are smaller, weighing around 440 pounds at most, according to the\u00a0International Association for Bear Research and Management. Thousands of the bears are culled in Japan each year.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers behind the \"Hitler's DNA\" documentary say the Nazi dictator likely had Kallmann Syndrome, a rare genetic condition which can cause undescended testicles and a micropenis.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Adolf Hitler most likely suffered from a rare genetic condition called Kallmann Syndrome, researchers and documentary makers said Thursday, following DNA testing of the Nazi dictator's blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the syndrome can \"disrupt the process that drives puberty\" and manifest in symptoms that include undescended testicles and a micropenis.",
      "The research also quashes the suggestion that Hitler had Jewish ancestry, the researcher say.",
      "Popular World War II songs often mocked Hitler's anatomy but lacked any scientific basis. The findings by an international team of scientists and historians now appear to confirm longstanding suspicions around his sexual development.",
      "\"No one has ever really been able to explain why Hitler was so uncomfortable around women throughout his life, or why he probably never entered into intimate relations with women,\" said Alex Kay of the University of Potsdam. \"But now we know that he had Kallmann Syndrome, this could be the answer we've been looking for.\"",
      "The research findings are featured in a new documentary, \"Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,\" due to be broadcast on Saturday.",
      "The testing was made possible after researchers obtained a sample of Hitler's blood from a piece of material taken from the sofa on which he shot himself.",
      "The testing found a \"high likelihood\" that Hitler had Kallmann Syndrome, though Britain's Guardian newspaper said in a Thursday article critical of the upcoming documentary that, \"in their attempt to authenticate the blood,\" the research team \"failed to get a fresh DNA sample from any of Hitler's surviving relatives in Austria and the U.S., who are all understandably reluctant about media exposure.\"",
      "The testing of Hitler's DNA showed \"very high\" scores \u2014   in the top one percent \u2014   for a predisposition to autism, schizophrenia and biopolar disorder, program makers Blink Films said.",
      "The Guardian article, however, said that many scientists aren't comfortable using the kind of genetic testing cited by the researchers, known as \"polygenic risk scores,\" to indicate an individual's likelihood of developing such disorders.",
      "\"Polygenic risk scores tell you something about population at large, not about individuals,\" honorary professor David Curtis, at University College London's Genetics Institute, told the Guardian. \"If a test shows you to be in the upper percentile of polygenic risk, the actual risk of acquiring a condition may still be very low, even for conditions that are strongly influenced by genetic factors.\"",
      "The research team stressed that such conditions, even if Hitler did have them, also could not explain or excuse the Nazi leader's warmongering or racist policies.",
      "Over 50 million people are estimated to have died in World War II, including six million Jews were who were systematically murdered.",
      "Geneticist Turi King, known for identifying the remains of medieval king Richard III and who also worked on the project, said Hitler's genes put him in a category of people who were often sent to the gas chambers by the Nazis.",
      "\"Hitler's policies are completely around eugenics,\" said the expert in ancient and forensic DNA at the University of Bath in western England.",
      "\"If he had been able to look at his own DNA ... he almost certainly would have sent himself,\" she said.",
      "Analysis \"debunks this myth\" that Hitler had a Jewish grandfather",
      "The DNA results additionally rule out the possibility that Hitler had a Jewish grandfather via his grandmother, who was rumored to have gotten pregnant by an employer in whose home she worked.",
      "\"Analysis of the DNA debunks this myth by showing that the Y chromosome data matches the DNA of Hitler's male line relative. If he had Jewish ancestry (through an outside relationship), that match wouldn't be there,\" the production company added.",
      "Russia's top diplomat, long-time Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, cited the unsubstantiated theory of Hitler's Jewish lineage in 2022 as he defended Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin baselessly claimed was intended to \"denazify\" the neighboring country, led by Jewish President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",

      "Namewee, whose birth name is Wee Meng Chee, was released until Nov. 26 pending the results of an autopsy of Iris Hsieh, also known as Hsieh Yu-hsin or \"nurse goddess\" to fans, Kuala Lumpur police chief Fadil Marsus said in a statement.",

      "Hsieh, a 31-year-old influencer, was found dead on Oct. 22 in a bathtub at a high-end hotel in the Malaysian capital. She was in Malaysia to discuss a commercial video Namewee had agreed to direct, her social media manager previously\u00a0told the BBC.",

      "Known for his trademark beanie, which on occasion he pairs with sunglasses, Namewee was blacklisted by Beijing in 2021 after he penned a Mandarin song mocking Chinese nationalists \u2014 that amassed more than 30 million views on YouTube.",
      "Namewee is no stranger to controversy, however, sparking widespread criticism in his home country over the 2007 release of \"Negarakuku,\" a parody of the Malaysian national anthem.",
      "He was also detained in Malaysia in 2016 for several days after he allegedly insulted Islam in a video partly filmed inside a mosque in the Muslim-majority country. Namewee insisted the video for the song \"Oh My God\" was intended to promote religious harmony, the BBC reported at the time.",
      "Just two years later, he was arrested again for insulting Islam with a Lunar New Year video that featured dancers wearing dog masks and performing suggestive moves.",
      "Malaysian media reported Namewee contacted emergency services shortly after midnight on Oct. 22 after he found Hsieh unresponsive in the bathroom.",
      "Police arrested Namewee that same day, after they found nine blue pills believed to be ecstasy in the hotel room, the BBC reported. Namewee denied he had used drugs but tested positive for several illicit substances, including amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine and THC, police said, according to the BBC.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to the drug charges, the BBC reported.",

      "Venezuela announced Tuesday that it was launching a massive military exercise across the country, reportedly involving some 200,000 forces, in response to the increasing presence of U.S. military assets in the region. The announcement by Venezuela's military came as the U.S. Department of Defense confirmed the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Gerald Ford had entered the Southern Command's area of responsibility \u2014 which includes the Caribbean.",
      "The Venezuelan Ministry of Defense said the exercise launched Tuesday involved the deployment of land, air and sea assets.",

      "\"They are murdering defenseless people, whether or not they are drug traffickers, executing them without due process,\" Padrino was quoted as saying, referring to U.S. military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific that began in September.",
      "Since then, U.S. forces have targeted around 20 vessels in international waters, killing at least 76 people. The Trump administration says the operations \u2014\u00a0the details of which remain murky\u00a0\u2014 are part of an anti-drug offensive.",

    "summary": "Israel's president says Trump sent him a letter asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he received a letter from President Trump on Wednesday asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing court cases, with no ruling yet delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.",
      "In a speech to the Israeli parliament in October, Mr. Trump urged Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, telling the gathered lawmakers: \"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right over here [Netanyahu], and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "\"This morning, President Isaac Herzog received the attached letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, calling on him to consider granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Herzog's office said in a statement, adding that the president could not initiate a pardon based on the American leader's request alone.",
      "In his letter, Mr. Trump said he was writing to Herzog at a \"historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years.\"",
      "\"I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister,\" it added. \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System ... I believe that this 'case' against Bibi ... is political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "Netanyahu has long been known by the nickname Bibi.",
      "Mr. Trump also framed his request for Netanyahu's pardon as something his Israeli counterpart deserved for working with the White House to reach the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, saying: \"Now that we have achieved these unprecedented successes, and are keeping Hamas in check, it is time to let Bibi unite Israel by pardoning him, and ending that lawfare once and for all.\"",
      "He and his wife Sara are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods including cigars, jewelry and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favors. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favorable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.",
      "In a statement posted later Wednesday to X, Netanyahu thanked Mr. Trump for his \"incredible support,\" adding: \"As usual, you get right to the point and call it like it is. I look forward to continuing our partnership to bolster security and expand peace.\"",
      "The statement from Herzog's office said the Israeli president holds Mr. Trump \"in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciations for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Alongside and not withstanding this ... anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,\" it added.",
      "During his current term, which started in late 2022, Netanyahu proposed far-reaching judicial reforms that critics say sought to weaken the courts. Those prompted massive protests that were only curtailed after the onset of the Gaza war in October 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused his political opponents of using the Justice Department to target him during his time out of office, and since he returned to the White House, the department, now run by his appointees, has pushed for Biden-era justice officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.",
      "In September, he\u00a0pushed\u00a0Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Comey and James have since been indicted on criminal charges.",

      "\"In his haste to flee Waterloo, where his armies had been overwhelmed by the combined forces of the British and Prussian armies, Napoleon had to abandon some of his carriages when they got stuck in a muddy road a few miles away from the battlefield \u2014 including the carriage containing those precious belongings,\" it said.",
      "The sale price vastly outstripped the high end of the pre-sale estimate of 200,000 francs. The hammer price was 2.85 million francs, excluding fees and other charges that were included in the final aggregate price.",
      "Sotheby's did not disclose the identity of the seller, and said that the buyer was a \"private collector.\"",
      "The brooch and a few other items were offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III as battle trophies in 1815 three days after the Battle of Waterloo, according to Sotheby's. It remained among heirlooms of the Prussian Royal House of Hohenzollern for centuries and over the last few years was part of a different private collection.",
      "Among dozens of lots on the auction block was a green beryl weighing over 132 carats, which Napoleon was said to have worn at his 1804 coronation. The jewel sold for a hammer price of 838,000 francs, or more than 17 times the high-end pre-sale estimate.",
      "One diamond expert said the sale took on added allure in the wake of the robbery of Napoleonic jewels from the Louvre museum in Paris last month. The thieves made off with eight pieces in broad daylight  and dropped one as they made their escape.",
      "\"Given the recent Louvre heist and the provenance of arguably the most famous French figure in history, I'm not surprised the jewel achieved a majestic 3.5 million francs,\" said Tobias Kormind, managing director of online jeweler 77 Diamonds. \"The brooch arrives at a moment of renewed global fascination with Napoleonic jewels, and its story is irresistible.\"",

    "summary": "Google said the fake messages are part of a massive criminal network called \"Lighthouse\" that has stolen information through phishing and smishing scams.",
    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",
      "\"Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,\" do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. \"We can change. But we must do it together.\"",
      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States.

      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon.

      "\"Metformin is the most widely used glucose-lowering medication used around the world,\" said Steven Malin, lead study author and a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health at Rutgers' School of Arts and Sciences.",
      "\"However, it is not clear that taking both of these treatments together is best,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"If they are not, people could notice that energy levels may be low and/or their health is not getting better. This could lead to 'psychological defeat,' so to speak, and impact overall wellness and quality of life.\"",

      "The 16-week, double-blind trial followed 72 adults at risk for metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar and excess body fat that increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Participants were split into four groups, with two performing high- or low-intensity exercise with a placebo and two performing the same workouts on 2,000 milligrams of metformin daily.",
      "Participants also saw less reduction in inflammation and fasting glucose levels.",
      "At the end of the study, those who exercised without the drug showed clear improvements in vascular insulin sensitivity, meaning their blood vessels responded better to insulin and allowed more oxygen and nutrients to reach muscles. But when metformin was added, those gains shrank. Participants also saw less reduction in inflammation and fasting glucose levels.",

      "Malin said it may relate to blood vessel health. \"Improved blood vessel function is key for delivering nutrients to tissues, like sugar,\" he explained. \"If the sugar cannot be delivered to the tissue, this might explain why muscles cannot use the sugar for energy as well in response to insulin.\"",

      "Colon cancer patients could live longer if they take GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, a new study suggests. (iStock)",
      "\"The central message is that GLP-1 medications were associated with substantially lower five-year mortality among patients with colon cancer, and that this signal was most pronounced in those with severe obesity, with BMI at or above 35,\" lead study author Raphael Cuomo, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, told Fox News Digital.",

      "The researcher said the findings, which were published in the journal Cancer Investigation on Nov. 11, were surprising.",
      "\"I expected some benefit in patients with severe obesity, because GLP-1 therapies directly target the metabolic and inflammatory milieu that drives worse colon cancer outcomes, but the absolute difference in five-year mortality was larger than many clinicians might anticipate,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Only about 15% of GLP-1 users died within five years compared with 37% of non-users. (iStock)",
      "One potential reason for the effect is that GLP-1s are known to reduce inflammation, lower insulin levels and promote weight loss, which could also slow down cancer growth, the release stated.",

      "Dr. Marc Siegel, a Fox News senior medical analyst who was not involved in the research, noted that the study is observational, so it can\u2019t prove causation, but it is \"very exciting, because it fits in with what is becoming clearer and clearer about these drugs.\"",
      "\"Namely, they are systemic anti-inflammatory agents that overcome insulin resistance and improve metabolic function,\" he went on. \"It is disarray of metabolism, especially when accompanied by inflammatory chemicals that can form the precursors of cancer, including colon cancer.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, primarily that it could not prove that GLP-1s caused the extended survival, but only established an association.",
      "\"One caveat: It may not be for all people,\" Siegel cautioned. \"Delayed gastric emptying, which accompanies these drugs, could be a carcinogenic factor with some patients, perhaps those with inflammatory bowel disease.\"",
      "The survival benefit was seen even after accounting for factors like age, cancer severity and other medical issues. (iStock)",

      "\"Patients should not interpret these findings as evidence that GLP-1 medications are proven cancer drugs,\" said Cuomo. \"For now, the appropriate way to act on this work is to ensure that people with colon cancer who also have obesity or diabetes are offered guideline-supported metabolic therapies, including GLP-1 agents when clinically indicated, as part of comprehensive care.\"",

      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary makes an announcement about his agency\u2019s intent to remove the \"black box\" warnings from hormone replacement therapy for menopause.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is initiating the removal of \"black box\" warning labels from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products used to ease menopause symptoms, a move Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said is backed by decades of research on the therapy\u2019s benefits and clinical trials that do not support earlier fears linking it to higher breast cancer mortality.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at a press conference alongside Makary on Monday that the so-called \"black box\" labels, the strongest warnings for prescription drugs the agency can require, were designed to \"frighten women and to silence doctors.\"",
      "\"It warned of diseases and dangers that the data simply did not support. Bureaucrats at the FDA reacted out of fear, not gold standard science. And instead of correcting the record, the medical establishment doubled down in groupthink,\" said Kennedy. \"The consequences have been devastating.\"",

    "story": [
      "Could the Klein Vision AirCar redefine the future of travel? Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses.",
      "Pennsylvania may soon join the few states ready to welcome flying cars. State Sen. Marty Flynn from the 22nd District has reintroduced Senate Bill 1077, also known as the Jetsons Act, during the 2025-2026 Regular Session.",
      "The proposal amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating a new legal category for roadable aircraft. These vehicles would have the unique ability to operate both on public roads as motor vehicles and in the air as aircraft.",
      "The legislation was referred to the Senate Transportation Committee Nov. 5, 2025. Although a similar version failed to pass last session, Flynn remains committed to positioning Pennsylvania as a leader in advanced transportation technology. He believes that laying the groundwork now will allow the state to adapt quickly when these vehicles become commercially viable.",

      "Lawmakers hope clear rules today will make tomorrow\u2019s skyways as safe as the highways below. (Rachel Wisniewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why this bill matters",
      "Technology is advancing faster than most laws can keep up. The rise of advanced air mobility is blurring the line between cars and aircraft.",
      "Several companies, including\u00a0Alef Aeronautics,\u00a0Samson Sky and\u00a0CycloTech are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.",
      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",
      "Sen. Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",
      "CHINESE AUTO GIANT WANTS TO MAKE FLYING CARS YOUR NEXT COMMUTE OPTION",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s Jetsons Act aims to prepare the state for the future of flying cars before they take off. (CycloTech)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sen. Flynn's Jetsons Act might sound futuristic, but it reflects a growing reality in transportation. As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.",

The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software.

      "Conduent, which manages critical public services across the United States, says hackers infiltrated its systems for nearly three months. The cyberattack exposed personal information linked to more than 10 million people.",
      "All about the Conduent breach and its scale",
      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",
      "Conduent manages technology and payment systems for dozens of U.S. state governments, processing roughly $85 billion in annual disbursements and handling over 2 billion customer service interactions every year. According to its own estimates, it supports around 100 million residents through various government health and welfare programs.",

      "The company reported that at least 400,000 people in Texas were affected, with compromised data including Social Security numbers, medical records and health insurance details. Other affected states include Washington, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts and California.

      "How the Conduent breach unfolded",
      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",
      "HACKERS TARGET ONLINE STORES WITH NEW ATTACK",
      "We reached out to Conduent for a comment, and a rep for the company provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"As previously disclosed in its April 2025 Form 8-K filing with the SEC, in January 2025, Conduent discovered that it was the victim of a cybersecurity incident.\u00a0 With respect to that incident, Conduent has agreed to send notification letters, on behalf of its customers, to individuals whose personal information may have been affected by this incident.\u00a0 In addition, a dedicated call center has been set up to address consumer inquiries. At this time, Conduent has no evidence of any attempted or actual misuse of any information potentially affected by this incident.",
      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process. Conduent takes this matter seriously and regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\"",

      "Even though Conduent claims the stolen data hasn't surfaced online, that doesn't mean it's safe. Data exfiltration on this scale has long-term implications, from identity theft to potential fraud within public benefit systems. The real test will be how both Conduent and its government partners adapt their cybersecurity oversight to prevent similar breaches. Because at this point, the question isn't whether these systems will be targeted again, but whether they'll be any better prepared when it happens.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 07:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas startup Janta Power raises $5.5M for innovative vertical solar towers that generate 50% more energy than traditional panels while using just one-third the land.",
    "story": [
      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

    "story": [
      "CyberGuy explains how to make safe and secure passwords on your iPhone.",
      "Your Mac holds a lot more than just files. It carries your personal information, payment data, messages and every online account you access. Keeping that information safe starts with how you sign in. For years, passwords have been the standard way to protect accounts, but they are also one of the weakest links in digital security. They can be guessed, stolen or reused across multiple sites.",
      "Apple's introduction of passkeys marks a major step forward. Instead of relying on something you need to remember, passkeys rely on something you have (your trusted Apple device) and something you are, like your fingerprint or face. Together with iCloud Keychain and two-factor authentication, passkeys create a seamless and much safer way to secure your Mac and your digital life.",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They use public key cryptography to let you sign in without ever creating or typing a password. When you register for an account using a passkey, your Mac creates two unique keys. One is public and stored by the website or app, and the other is private and stays securely on your device.",
      "The public key is not sensitive information. The private key, on the other hand, never leaves your Mac and is protected behind your device's security features. When you sign in, Touch ID or Face ID confirms your identity before your Mac uses the private key to authenticate you. This process prevents phishing and password leaks because no shared secret is ever transmitted to the website.",

      "HOW TO USE PASSKEYS TO KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SAFE",
      "A passkey on your Mac replaces passwords with a faster, more secure way to sign in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Apple keeps passkeys secure",
      "Passkeys are stored and synced across your devices through iCloud Keychain, which is protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that not even Apple can access your passkeys or passwords. iCloud Keychain also has built-in protection against brute force attacks, even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to Apple's servers.",
      "If you lose your devices, you can still recover your passkeys through iCloud Keychain recovery. To do this, you must sign in with your Apple ID and password, verify your identity with a code sent to your trusted number and confirm using your device passcode. The system limits the number of attempts, and if too many failed attempts occur, the recovery record is locked or destroyed to prevent misuse.",
      "You can also set an account recovery contact to make sure you never lose access, even if you forget your Apple ID password or device passcode. This multi-layered design ensures that your data remains secure even in extreme scenarios, such as a compromised Apple account or cloud breach.",
      "How to set up passkeys on your Mac",
      "Setting up passkeys is simple and requires iCloud Keychain to be enabled.",

They may send fake emails or messages pretending to be from Apple or other trusted companies, urging you to click links or provide login details. Always double-check the sender's address and avoid clicking on links that seem suspicious. Instead, visit the website directly by typing the address into your browser.",
      "While macOS has strong built-in defenses such as Gatekeeper and XProtect, installing strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection against malware, adware and potentially unwanted programs. Strong antivirus software continuously monitors your system for suspicious behavior and can alert you to threats before they cause damage. It is especially useful if you download files from outside the App Store or connect external drives frequently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Apple regularly releases software updates that include important security patches. Cybercriminals often target outdated systems because they contain known vulnerabilities.

      "Kids are spending more time online than ever, and that early exposure is opening the door to a new kind of danger.",
      "Artificial intelligence has supercharged online scams, creating personalized and convincing traps that even adults can fall for. The latest Bitwarden \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2025\" poll shows that while parents know these risks exist, most still haven't had a serious talk with their children about them.",
      "This growing communication gap is leaving the youngest internet users vulnerable at a time when online safety depends more than ever on education and oversight.",
      "Young children face real risks online",
      "Children as young as preschool age are now part of the connected world, yet few truly understand how to stay safe. The Bitwarden survey found that 42% of parents with children between 3 and 5 years old said their child had accidentally shared personal information online.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "5 PHONE SAFETY TIPS EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW",
      "AI-powered scams are finding new ways to reach kids who go online earlier than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Nearly 80% of kids between the ages of 3 and 12 already have their own tablet or another connected device. Many parents assume supervision software or family settings are enough, but that assumption breaks down when kids explore apps, games and chat spaces designed to hold their attention. Device access has become nearly universal by early elementary school, but meaningful supervision and honest safety conversations are lagging behind.",
      "The AI threat and the parental disconnect",
      "Artificial intelligence has changed the nature of online scams by making them sound familiar, personal and hard to recognize. Bitwarden's data shows that 78% of parents worry their child could fall for an AI-enhanced threat, such as a voice-cloned message or a fake chat with a friend. Despite that fear, almost half of those same parents haven't talked with their kids about what an AI-powered scam might look like. The disconnect is even stronger among Gen Z parents.",
      "About 80% of them say they are afraid their child will fall victim to an AI-based scheme, yet 37% allow their kids full or nearly full autonomy online. In those households, problems are more common. Malware infections, unauthorized in-app purchases and phishing attempts appear at the highest rates among families who worry the most but monitor the least. The paradox is clear. Parents recognize the threat but fail to translate awareness into consistent action.",
      "Why parents haven't had the talk",
      "There are many reasons this important talk keeps getting delayed. Some parents simply feel unprepared to explain AI, while others assume their existing safety tools will protect their children. Only 17% of parents in the United States actively seek information about AI technologies, according to related research by Barna Group. That leaves a large majority relying on partial knowledge or outdated advice.",
      "Many parents also juggle multiple devices at home, making it difficult to track every app or game their child uses. Some overestimate how safe their own habits are, even though they admit to reusing passwords or skipping security updates. Without firsthand understanding or personal discipline, it becomes even harder to teach those lessons to children. As a result, many kids face the internet with curiosity but without proper guidance.",
      "Smart ways to protect your child online",
      "The Bitwarden findings make one thing clear: kids are getting connected younger, and scams powered by artificial intelligence are already targeting them. The good news is that parents can take practical steps right now to reduce those risks and build lasting online safety habits.",
      "Set up tablets, laptops and gaming consoles in shared family areas rather than bedrooms. When screens stay visible, you naturally become part of your child's online world. This not only encourages open conversation but also helps spot suspicious messages, fake friend requests or scam links before they cause trouble.",
      "Staying involved in your child\u2019s digital life is the best defense against today\u2019s AI threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Most devices have strong tools you can activate in minutes. Apple's Screen Time and Google Family Link let you limit screen time, approve new app installs and monitor how long your child spends on specific apps. These controls are especially useful for younger kids who, according to the Bitwarden poll, often have little supervision despite heavy device use.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Before your child installs a new game or app, take a moment to check it together. Read the reviews, look at what data it collects and confirm the developer's name. Explain why some games or \"free\" apps might ask for camera or contact access they don't need. This kind of shared review teaches healthy skepticism and helps children recognize red flags later on.",
      "AI scams thrive on weak or reused passwords. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins for each account.\u00a0Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible so that even if a password is stolen, the account stays protected.\u00a0Let your kids see how you use these tools so they learn that security isn't complicated, it's just a habit.",
      "Many parents delay important online safety talks because they feel unprepared to explain AI, leaving kids curious but without the guidance they need to stay safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the best defenses is simple: encourage your child to pause and talk before reacting to anything unusual online. Whether it's a pop-up claiming a prize, a strange link in a chat or a voice message that sounds familiar, remind them it's always okay to ask you first. Quick conversations like these can prevent costly mistakes and turn learning moments into trust-building ones.",
      "Outdated software can leave gaps that scammers exploit. Regularly update operating systems, browsers and apps to close those holes. Add strong antivirus software. Explain to your child that updates and scans keep their favorite games and videos running safely, not just their parents happy.",
      "The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't save these conversations for when something goes wrong. Bring them up casually during family time or when watching YouTube or gaming together. Treat digital safety like any other life skill, something practiced daily and improved with time. The more normal it feels, the more confident your child becomes when facing online risks.",
      "Talking about online safety early helps build trust and awareness before trouble starts.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a parent, guardian or anyone helping a child use technology, this issue deserves your attention. Start talking early, even before your child begins exploring the web on their own. Teach them simple concepts like asking before clicking or sharing. Instead of relying only on parental controls, have ongoing conversations that help them recognize suspicious links, messages or pop-ups. Show them that cybersecurity isn't about fear but about awareness. Model strong digital habits at home by using unique passwords and turning on\u00a0two-factor authentication. Explain why those steps matter. When your child understands the reasoning behind the rules, they are more likely to follow them. Make technology part of your family routine rather than a private space your child navigates alone. Regularly check the apps they use and the people they interact with. Set clear expectations and age-appropriate boundaries that can grow with your child's experience. Staying engaged is the most powerful protection you can offer.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The numbers from Bitwarden show a clear warning sign. Concern among parents is high, yet actual conversations about AI-powered scams remain rare. That silence gives scammers the upper hand. Children who learn about online safety early are more confident, more cautious and better equipped to handle unexpected messages or fake alerts. It only takes a few minutes of honest conversation to create awareness that lasts for years. By taking action now, you can close the gap between fear and understanding, protecting your family in a digital world that changes every day.",

      "The dream of personal flight has always felt just out of reach, until now. A company called AltoVolo has unveiled something that might make it real: the world's first eVTOL configurator.",
      "That might sound technical, but it's actually simple. \"eVTOL\" stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Think of a small, quiet aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter but flies forward like a plane, all powered by electric or hybrid engines instead of noisy fuel-burning ones.",
      "And a configurator? It's a tool that lets you design your own version online, choosing colors, materials and other personal details. Put the two together, and you've got something quite remarkable: the ability to design your own flying vehicle from your laptop.",

      "With AltoVolo\u2019s world-first online configurator, you can design every detail of your Sigma eVTOL. (AltoVolo)",
      "A new kind of personal aircraft",
      "AltoVolo's aircraft is called the Sigma, and it's unlike anything on the market. It's a three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle that combines quiet operation with long range. The Sigma can fly about 500 miles, reach speeds over 220 mph and is more than 80% quieter than a helicopter.",
      "That quietness isn't just about comfort; it's what makes urban air travel possible. Imagine small aircraft quietly taking off from rooftops or open fields, connecting cities and towns without the noise pollution we associate with helicopters today.",
      "Safety is built in, too. The Sigma can keep flying even if one of its small electric jet engines fails, and it carries a ballistic parachute for emergencies. It's compact and light, just under 16 feet wide and weighing a little over 2,100 pounds, making it easier to operate and store than you might expect.",
      "The Sigma is over 80% quieter than a helicopter combining sleek hybrid-electric power with quiet performance. (AltoVolo)",
      "From concept to customization",
      "The idea of customizing your own aircraft might sound futuristic, but AltoVolo's online configurator makes it surprisingly accessible.",
      "Like building your own car online, you can choose colors, seat materials, interior details and even the stitching on your seatbelts. Founder and CEO Will\u00a0Wood says the company's goal isn't to compete on price but on experience and technology.",
      "\"Much like you'd expect from a supercar brand, we're focused on performance and refinement,\" he explained.",
      "The first 100 Sigma models will be limited editions, offering special finishes and materials that won't appear on later production units.",
      "NASA'S 'QUIET' SUPERSONIC JET COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT IN POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL",
      "Taking flight before you take off",
      "AltoVolo isn't stopping at online design. They've built a high-fidelity flight simulator that mirrors the Sigma's cockpit exactly, right down to its carbon fiber and soft leather interior.",
      "Customers can train in the simulator and even use those hours toward a pilot's license. The simulator gives them a chance to \"fly\" their customized Sigma before ever leaving the ground.",
      "And for everyone else? The company is sharing flight footage from its simulator on YouTube, so people can see how the Sigma handles in the air.",
      "\"For AltoVolo, opening our order book is a major milestone in bringing the Sigma to life,\" Wood tells CyberGuy. \"Having early customers make an initial financial commitment shows us real demand. In turn, we are able to raise capital to finalise the product, progress certification and prepare for production. Presenting the flight simulator has been a useful catalyst. Allowing customers to fly in a simulated environment really helps them realise how easy this type of aircraft will be to fly.\"",
      "An exclusive community for early Sigma owners shapes the future of personal air travel and sustainable innovation. (AltoVolo)",
      "Innovation you can feel",
      "One of the most interesting details about the Sigma is something you can't see: the sound inside the cabin. AltoVolo's engineers are working to reduce vibration and interior noise, creating a calm, smooth flight experience.",
      "At the same time, they're experimenting with a synthesized soundscape, a gentle background tone that changes with the aircraft's power use. It helps pilots sense how the vehicle is performing and adds a cinematic touch to the flying experience.",
      "It's part science, part art and a hint at how human-centered this design really is.",
      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots. Certification is also underway in Europe and the UK, which could make global operations possible in the next few years.",
      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AltoVolo's Sigma may not replace your car anytime soon, but it gives us a glimpse of what's coming: a world where flight is cleaner, quieter and designed around the individual. It's a preview of how the future of travel might not be on the road at all, but instead in the air.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:36:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",
      "POWER ON THE MOVE: IS PILOT PROGRAM THE FUTURE OF EV CHARGING?",

      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

      "This\u00a0PLOS Climate study reinforces that after the first two years, EVs deliver real and lasting climate benefits. As the U.S. grid shifts toward cleaner energy, its impact grows even stronger. The authors note that the analysis does not include emissions from recycling or charging infrastructure, yet it remains one of the most thorough long-term views of EV adoption and its effects on the economy and environment.",

      "On Oct. 15, the Student Government Association (SGA) Senate at Loyola barred a Turning Point chapter from becoming an officially recognized organization on campus, sparking a national outcry. Now, two law students have stepped in to help the conservative group draft and file an appeal with the SGA.",

      "\"Reviewing the SGA grievance of why they denied the charter, it was fabricated through equity and not through law,\" Estis said. \"Most of it was subjective reasoning. They didn't really root it in any of the laws or rules and regulations that they're supposed to follow, and it was purely subjective. And that was our basis in attack in the written appeal that we did.\"",

      "Estis noted that one of the reasons the chapter was officially denied is because, according to the SGA, Turning Point is too similar to other Christian organizations on campus. But as Estis pointed out, Turning Point isn't even an explicitly Christian group, and advocates for conservative principles like free markets and limited government.",

      "\"They were very, very grateful for [the help]. They told me their story. I wrote out exactly what I thought [the appeal] should look like,\" Estis said. \"They made some edits and changes, as did I. But they didn't have a lot of guidance from the get-go of where to go.\"",

      "Tymur Mindich, who was once Zelenskyy's business partner, was identified by Ukraine's anti-corruption watchdogs as being the orchestrator of a scheme involving top officials and Ukraine's state nuclear power company. Prior to the scandal, some feared Mindich's growing influence over Ukraine's lucrative industries that he had access to because of his ties to Zelenskyy.",
      "Mindich allegedly exerted control over loyalists who then pressured contractors for Energoatom, Ukraine's state-owned nuclear power company, demanding kickbacks to bypass bureaucratic obstacles. The requested kickbacks were reportedly as high as 15%.",

      "The original batch of documents released online is divided into seven large files roughly centered around the main Nazi criminals covered in them. There are multiple documents related to Adolf Eichmann, the engineer of the \"Final Solution,\" the plan for the extermination of European Jewry. He lived under the name Ricardo Klement around Buenos Aires until being captured by Mossad agents on Argentine soil and taken in a secret operation to stand trial in Jerusalem in 1960.",

      "\"There are numerous questions that these documents can bring light to, as to why a sophisticated society, far from the plagues of European antisemitism such as Argentina\u2019s, agreed to hide Nazi criminals and their secrets for so long. What happened to the U-boats loaded with Nazi gold brought to the country and given to the authorities?\" he asked.",
      "\"On the one hand, it is shameful that Argentina kept these documents a secret for so long, but on the other hand, we also need to acknowledge the enormous efforts being made by this government to make these documents public.

Upon inspection, the crates revealed documents intercepted by Argentine customs in 1941, sent from the German Third Reich Embassy in Tokyo, Japan, to Argentina\u2019s capital, Buenos Aires, aboard the Japanese steamer Nan-a-Maru.",
      "The documents had been sent as personal effects of embassy personnel but were intercepted under orders of the country\u2019s minister for foreign affairs in order not to undermine Argentina\u2019s neutral position in the war. The shipment became the subject of a probe by a commission investigating \"anti-Argentine activities,\" which led to the seizure and possession of the crates by the country's supreme court, where they remained for nearly 84 years.",

It was later proven that the lead was incorrect and that Flegal was not Borman. Earlier this year, Argentina President Javier Milei declassified and released over 1,850 documents detailing Argentina's efforts to track and verify the whereabouts of thousands of Nazi war criminals. (General Archives of the Government of Argentina)",
      "After opening the boxes along with prominent members of the country's Jewish community, the court issued a statement saying that \"given the historical relevance of the find and the potential crucial information it could contain to clarify events related to the Holocaust,\" an exhaustive survey of all the material was ordered.",

      "\"Jews after World War II lived a golden age of about 80 years where antisemitism had subsided, at least apparently, and they could be productive and contributing members of society. This has now ended \u2014 partially because of the genocide committed against Israelis by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, with world opinion projecting on Israelis and Jews the false role of perpetrators of genocide in the war in Gaza, but also by bringing back the same old antisemitic views that had been alive in Germany and before then,\" Lippman says.",

      "\"The humanitarian toll is catastrophic,\" he added. \"Over 30% of Venezuela\u2019s population has been forcibly displaced. Starvation has been weaponized as a tool of social control, amounting to a war crime under international law. Despite the enormity of these crimes, many United Nations member states continue to recognize and engage with this illegitimate regime, thereby perpetuating its impunity. The failure to confront this crisis decisively enables a coalition of adversaries, state and non-state actors alike, to project power dangerously close to U.S. territory.\"",
      "For now, Washington\u2019s sanctions campaign still constrains Venezuela\u2019s oil lifelines. In March 2025, Reuters reported that U.S. threats to impose tariffs on nations buying Venezuelan crude caused a temporary disruption in shipments to China. Beijing dismissed the measures as \"illegal extraterritorial actions\" and vowed to continue cooperation \u2014 but has not disclosed how it will enforce the new tariff-free pact.",

    "story": [
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chairman of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security, says \"standing with Israel is in our strategic interest.\"",
      "Critics once called it isolationist. But national security experts now say Donald Trump\u2019s \"America First\" strategy is proving to be something else entirely \u2014 a hard-nosed policy of deterrence built on strong alliances, especially with Israel.",
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chair of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security and former chief of staff at the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital that \"The America First approach to U.S. national security means a strong national security policy, a decisive president, keeping our nation out of unnecessary wars, having members of alliances carry their own weight, but it also means standing strongly with Israel and fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "He said supporting Israel is not about sentiment. \"Standing with Israel is in our strategic interest,\" he said. \"Israel is dealing with enemies in the region that the U.S. would have to deal with if it were not there. So it\u2019s in our strategic interest.\"",

      "Mike Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), said Israel effectively absorbs threats that would otherwise demand U.S. military action. \"Historically, there are about three reasons why we have interests in the region,\" he said. \"One is Israel. Two is oil. And three is Islamic extremism \u2014 terrorism, Shia and Sunni.\"",
      "Makovsky said it is ironic that the America First debate has resurfaced \"only a few months after Israel smoked America\u2019s Mideast enemies.\" He pointed to Iran\u2019s nuclear advances and the role of its proxies. \"They\u2019re building ballistic missiles\u2026 They could reach the eastern seaboard of the United States,\" he said. \"You marry missiles with nukes that could hit the U.S. \u2014 you\u2019ve got the North Koreans on the West Coast; do you really want Iran that could hit the East Coast?\"",
      "According to Makovsky, Israel\u2019s campaign against those threats shows the alliance\u2019s strategic value. \"What did the Israelis just do? They took care of it. The United States came in with the B-2 at the very end\u2026 but it was Israel that did all that work,\" he said.",
      "He added that Israel \"pretty much finished off Hamas,\" weakened Hezbollah \u2014 \"which has hundreds of American soldiers\u2019 blood on their hands\" \u2014 and continues to confront the Houthis to \"ensure freedom of navigation.\" That, he argued, is deterrence in action: \"As long as we support Israel, we give them some help, we give them the weapons they need, they\u2019re really doing our work.\"",
      "Fleitz called Iran \"the biggest threat,\" encompassing \"Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies in the region. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah in Syria, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and then Iran itself, with its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror.\"",
      "He said Israel\u2019s actions have \"destroyed Hamas proxies and significantly weakened Iran,\" adding that \"we joined Israel in June in taking on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was a threat to global security.\"",
      "Both analysts framed Iran as part of a wider axis of power alongside Russia and China, each exploiting Middle East instability to undermine U.S. influence \u2014 by fueling proxy wars, spiking energy prices, and threatening trade routes through the Gulf and the Red Sea. Fleitz said Trump\u2019s willingness to act decisively \"to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program\" exemplified using strength to prevent costlier wars later.",

      "Both agree that energy policy is where America First becomes measurable. Fleitz said that \"energy independence is a very important part of President Trump\u2019s America First policy to free Americans from high energy bills.\" At the same time, he noted, energy diplomacy abroad reinforces economic security at home. \"By pushing the Saudis \u2014 and the Saudis, I think, are happy to help us with this \u2014 to produce more oil, it may actually help us end the war in Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Makovsky made a similar case for regional stability: \"The biggest threat to the Gulf Arab oil exporters \u2026 is Iran,\" he said. Without Israel\u2019s containment of Tehran, \"Iran would have taken over the Middle East, most likely. And if you care about oil prices, that\u2019s not too good.\"",

But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do these things when it is in U.S. strategic interests.\"",

      "\"That\u2019s because everybody in the Mideast, everyone in Asia, knows that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship is one of the closest in the world,\" Makovsky said. \"If we don\u2019t help Israel, it undercuts our credibility. The Chinese and the Russians and the North Koreans know that if we\u2019re not going to support Israel, we\u2019re not going to help other allies \u2026 and it would make us more vulnerable to the Chinese without a doubt.\"",

      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that if somebody agrees with you on policy, but thinks that you don\u2019t understand them, their culture, what they\u2019re going through and where they come from, then they\u2019re still not going to want to support you,\u201d he added.",
      "One place that young male voters found a sense of community and culture, Democrats say, is in the loose collection of podcasts often dubbed the \u201cmanosphere.\u201d",
      "These podcasts \u2014 hosted by comedians such as Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Tim Dillon and Andrew Schulz \u2014 often make \"you feel like you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Litman said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, often very funny. It\u2019s a little subversive or often very subversive. It feels intimate. You get to know the hosts over the course of hours and hours of conversation: their lives and their, their personalities and their quirks, and I think that is really special. Like, the parasocial relationship can be very powerful,\u201d she added.",
      "Litman\u2019s conclusions about the power of these podcasts are backed up by a Priorities USA research project called Warbler, which works to understand voters\u2019 online habits and media consumption.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I think that we were struck by in the research that we did is, people are looking for long-form [content], by and large,\u201d said Jeff Horwitt from Hart Research, a Democratic polling firm that partnered with Priorities USA on some of the research. (Horwitt and his firm also partner with a Republican polling outfit on the NBC News poll.) \u201cThey want a conversational back and forth. They want to learn something new rather than be told something old.\u201d",
      "Butterfield added that media consumption behavior among young voters is \u201cfundamentally different\u201d than even a decade ago.",
      "\u201cWe were teaching our candidates to, like, \u2018Get in and get out,\u2019 \u2018Say what you need to say, and let that voter move on,\u2019 because their attention spans are like goldfish,\u201d she said.",
      "Now, Butterfield added, \u201cthat\u2019s actually not the case. If you can get their attention, you\u2019ll have their attention, right? It\u2019s not about a lack of, a lack of eyeballs.\u201d",
      "A Priorities poll of 5,000 voters conducted in September found that while a majority \u2014 66% \u2014 of voters who reported listening to or watching certain \"manosphere\" podcasts in the past month voted for Trump in 2024, there was still a bright spot for Democrats in the research: an emerging break with Trump among this cohort.",
      "Of those \"manosphere\" Trump voters, 8% said they now disapproved of his performance as president, while 7% said they would vote for a Democrat on a generic congressional ballot.",
      "Meanwhile, some \"manosphere\" podcasters have broken with Trump on issues such as deportations, Israel's war in Gaza and the Jeffrey Epstein files in recent months.",
      "Still, Butterfield warned, Democrats can\u2019t take these cracks in Trump\u2019s coalition as an automatic sign of support for Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to just earn back all of these voters right away just because of their opposition to Trump. We\u2019re going to have to make sure we are offering an alternative point of view, alternative policies that solve their economic anxieties, visions for the future, etc.,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be the difference between an okay midterm and a really amazing midterm,\u201d Butterfield continued, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to just get by on people hating Trump alone. We\u2019ll get far-ish, but not as far as we need to go.\u201d",
      "In last week's New Jersey and Virginia elections, for example, Democratic Govs.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger won by larger-than-expected margins and made gains among young men in both states, exit polls show. But those margins among young men were still in line with their overall margins of victory, among an age group in which Democrats for years ran up the score compared to the overall electorate.",
      "\u2018Message, messenger and medium\u2019 are the keys",
      "In some ways, Democratic strategists and candidates say, the solution to their party\u2019s concerns about its performance among young men \u2014 or at least the start of it \u2014 is as easy as just appearing on these podcasts and in other male-friendly spaces.",
      "It\u2019s something several potential 2028 presidential candidates have already dabbled in. In April, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg sat for a nearly three-hour-long interview with the hosts of \u201cFlagrant.\u201d In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, participated in a four-hour-long podcast taping of the \u201cShawn Ryan Show.\u201d Both these podcasts hosted Trump in 2024.",
      "The problem with this strategy, Litman pointed out, is that not all Democratic leaders are comfortable with appearing on such programs.",
      "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t force it, but for the leaders who are capable of having those kinds of conversations, I think they should absolutely go into those environments and be a little bit risk averse or a little bit risk tolerant, rather,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s both message, messenger and medium \u2014 it\u2019s all of the above,\u201d Litman added later.",
      "One 2025 election winner who embraced this strategy was New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who gained popularity on TikTok, appeared on popular social media shows like \"Subway Takes,\" and joined the \"manosphere\" podcast \"Flagrant.\"",
      "Allred cited these \u201cmanosphere\u201d podcasts as one place more Democrats should be going, but said there are local spaces with the same informal, intimate environment \u2014 like high school football games \u2014 that many of his fellow Democrats should feel comfortable in but don\u2019t.",
      "\u201cI think that in the Democratic Party, there\u2019s almost been a reluctance to engage in things like football, and I don\u2019t really get that. I don\u2019t think you have to be the biggest fan of it to know that this is a place where the community is gathering and people are having, at least for me, these are some of the realest conversations I have in the entire week,\u201d he said.",
      "Appearing in these spaces would go a long way \u201cin terms of people seeing us, not as, kind of, elite ivory tower policy wonks,\u201d Allred added. \u201cAt a football game, you can have the same conversation about policy. It might be a little bit less wonkish, but it\u2019ll be more authentic \u2026 I think it\u2019s what most people are looking for in their leaders.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead to 2026 and 2028, Butterfield said that a priority \u201cis making sure that we\u2019re not sticking out like sore thumbs in these kind of \u2018entertainment-first\u2019 spaces.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that your ability to authentically communicate in these spaces should be a requirement to be a good candidate in today\u2019s world, right?\u201d she added. \u201cWe need to be holding our candidates to a high standard of electability, such that if you can\u2019t come across as yourself on social media, maybe we need to pick a different candidate.\u201d"

      "This much is known: \u201cWalk My Walk,\u201d a song by an artist called Breaking Rust, entered its second week Wednesday as the top song on Billboard\u2019s country music digital sales chart.",
      "After that, everything about Breaking Rust \u2014 the artist\u2019s identity, whether Breaking Rust\u2019s songs were created by artificial intelligence and whether the songs\u2019 popularity has been artificially inflated \u2014 quickly devolves into uncertainty. Is the song entirely AI? Partially AI? Maybe even a song meant to sound like AI? And who is behind Breaking Rust?",
      "There are few definitive answers. A request for comment sent by NBC News to the Instagram account of Breaking Rust went unanswered. The artist has virtually no other footprint outside of its Instagram, Spotify and YouTube pages.",
      "The mystery has caused a stir in a music industry already wrestling with its future, as some artists openly embrace AI and others vehemently oppose it. Last week, Billboard reported that at least one AI artist has debuted in each of its past six chart weeks \u2014 and acknowledged the figure could be even higher since \u201cit\u2019s become increasingly difficult to tell who or what is powered by AI \u2014 and to what extent.\u201d Although Billboard has described Breaking Rust and a similar-sounding artist, Cain Walker, as AI, neither of their Instagram or Spotify pages indicate that is so. Walker did not respond to a request for comment made through the artist\u2019s Instagram account.",
      "Still, their emergence has drawn criticism from some in the country music community.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the ultimate shortcut to stardom: no late nights in smoky bars, no raw vulnerability poured into lyrics, just algorithms crunching data to mimic the twang of authenticity,\u201d Leslie Fram, founder of FEMco, a Nashville-based creative consulting group, said in an email.",
      "Breaking Rust adds to a growing list of artists either found to be or suspected to be fueled by generative AI, which has evolved rapidly in recent years including in its ability to create realistic if generic music.",
      "This year, Masters of Prophecy, an AI-backed power pop-metal artist, became one of YouTube\u2019s fastest-growing accounts and today tallies 35.9 million subscribers. Unlike Breaking Rust or Cain Walker, its creator, James Baker, an engineer and father living in Ohio, has openly discussed his project and how it has gained a following.",
      "\u201cFor every critic, there\u2019s 20 positive comments,\u201d Baker told NBC News. \u201cThere was definitely a wave of AI music hate that was tough psychologically to make it through. But for the most part people have started adapting to it.\u201d",
      "Breaking Rust\u2019s most popular song on YouTube, \u201cLivin\u2019 on Borrowed Time,\u201d now has 4.6 million views. Commenters there seem unbothered \u2014 or unaware \u2014 of its AI nature.",
      "\u201cThis guy is SOOOOOOO underrated bro i love your music please release MOREEEE,\u201d the top comment reads.",
      "And in July, an indie band called The Velvet Sundown suddenly drew hundreds of thousands of listeners on Spotify amid similar speculation that the band was an AI creation.",
      "Along with speculation around the origin of Breaking Rust is some skepticism over whether its popularity is similarly inorganic. While no concrete evidence has yet emerged showing Breaking Rust\u2019s listening totals have been artificially inflated, on Wednesday, French-owned music streaming site Deezer reported the problem has become widespread among fully AI-generated tracks.",
      "This summer, Michael Lewan, the head of the Music Fights Fraud Alliance, a pro-artist group, called artificial streaming \u2014 that is, \u201cfake\u201d or bot-powered listens, which often tend to accompany AI-generated music \u2014 a bigger threat to music\u2019s integrity than AI itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s imperative for the industry to take a more serious approach to addressing some of the incentives that go behind music consumption, and shoring up vulnerabilities,\u201d Lewan told NBC News. He added: \u201cA system that is not protecting organic engagement and authentic listenership will be more prone to attacks by people making a quick buck off of the royalty pool.\u201d",
      "The success of Breaking Rust and Cain Walker does have its limitations. According to Luminate, which compiles sales data for Billboard, it only took about 2,500 digital downloads for \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d to debut at the top country digital sales chart. The broader Billboard Hot Country chart remains dominated by human artists, namely superstar Morgan Wallen, who occupies the top four slots.",
      "On his blog SavingCountryMusic.com, Kyle Coroneos wrote that however they ended up on Billboard\u2019s sales charts, the ability of artists like Breaking Rust to land on a Billboard chart represents a harbinger not only for country music, but also for an entire industry that increasingly seems to struggle to break new artists \u2014 and may be leaning into AI to resolve the issue.",
      "\u201cWhy are no artists breaking out? One reason is likely because many record labels are heavily investing in AI themselves as opposed to spending that effort and capital to break actual, human artists,\u201d Coroneos said."

      "Some medical centers are taking a dramatic step to save mothers and babies after studies have shown too many doctors fail to follow guidelines for preventing pre-eclampsia, a potentially deadly pregnancy complication.",
      "These hospitals now recommend that all of their pregnant patients take low-dose aspirin. Studies show the drug is safe and can help prevent pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure, and other pregnancy dangers.",
      "Last week, the March of Dimes, a nonprofit research and advocacy group focused on maternal and infant health, essentially blessed this approach, saying it may be \u201cmedically reasonable\u201d for some medical practices to offer all of their pregnant patients the drug.",
      "The move could pave the way for more doctors to recommend low-dose aspirin to all of their pregnant patients, much as they do already with prenatal vitamins.",
      "Pre-eclampsia, a leading cause of death among mothers and babies, affects about 1 in every 25 pregnancies in the U.S. Black mothers and women with high blood pressure or diabetes, or who are 35 or older, among other factors, are at increased risk.",
      "Rates of the disease have climbed 25% in the last two decades in the United States, according to the Preeclampsia Foundation.",
      "The March of Dimes report says that in clinical trials, low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by 15%, and also preterm birth by 20% and perinatal mortality \u2014 death of a fetus late in pregnancy or a baby in the first week of life \u2014 by 20%.",
      "More than a decade ago, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that pregnant women at increased risk for pre-eclampsia take low-dose aspirin, optimally from between 12 and 16 weeks of pregnancy until delivery,  to prevent the complication. The American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians has issued similar guidance \u2014 but studies show many doctors still don\u2019t follow it.",
      "The new March of Dimes guidelines say that if most pregnant patients in a practice are at increased risk of pre-eclampsia, it\u2019s reasonable to recommend low-dose aspirin to all of its pregnant patients.",
      "Some obstetricians applauded the new March of Dimes report, which is co-authored by the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, saying it could decrease the rates of pre-eclampsia.",
      "\u201cA statement by such well-respected, science-backed organizations could really move the needle,\u201d said Dr. Adam Lewkowitz, a pre-eclampsia expert and an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.",
      "\u2018Nobody ever mentioned\u2019 low-dose aspirin",
      "About five weeks before her due date, Angela Jones suddenly started speaking in gibberish and her vision blurred. On her way to the hospital, she had seizures and doesn\u2019t remember delivering her baby by emergency C-section.",
      "If Jones\u2019 doctors had followed guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, they would have recognized that because Jones was at increased risk for pre-eclampsia, she should have been taking low-dose aspirin during her pregnancy.",
      "\u201cNobody ever mentioned anything about low-dose aspirin to me,\u201d said Jones, who lives in Downey, California, and shared her story with the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could have seizures. I didn\u2019t know you could have a stroke, or even die from preeclampsia.\u201d",
      "The groups offer a screening tool so doctors can determine which of their patients should take the drug, and Jones fit several criteria: she\u2019s Black, obese, and this was her first baby in more than 10 years.",
      "A complicated, time-consuming formula",
      "Many obstetricians say women like Jones get missed because doctor\u2019s appointments, which are often just 15 minutes long, are too jam-packed to fit in a complex assessment of a patient\u2019s risk factors.",
      "A 2022 study from the Duke University School of Medicine looked at babies born in the U.S. in 2019, and found that 85.7% of the mothers were eligible for low-dose aspirin during their pregnancies, but according to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, less than half of pregnant patients who should be taking the drug are taking it.",
      "Low-dose aspirin can prevent pre-eclampsia by improving blood flow to the uterus, according to the March of Dimes. While some studies have shown an increased risk of bleeding for the mother, the March of Dimes said a review of 21 randomized controlled trials showed no increased risk of bleeding, and the group says there\u2019s no evidence of harm to mother or baby.",
      "Because the formula to determine which pregnant women should get low-dose aspirin can be complicated and time-consuming, a growing number of major hospitals have begun recommending it to all of their pregnant patients.",
      "Dr. David Hackney, the division chief of maternal-fetal medicine at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, said the current guidelines are onerous. \u201cIt can all look good on paper, but then there\u2019s the way things work out in the real world,\u201d Hackney said.",
      "Because of that, University Hospitals began recommending low-dose aspirin to all pregnant women a few months ago, he said.",
      "The Cleveland Clinic has made the same move, said Dr. Adina Kern-Goldberger, an assistant professor at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine.",
      "Parkland Health in Dallas, one of the busiest maternity hospitals in the U.S., started the practice three years ago, according to Dr. Elaine Duryea, chief of obstetrics at Parkland and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UT Southwestern Medical Center. She said her team is currently tracking pre-eclampsia rates to see whether the policy has made a difference.",
      "At all these practices, patients can opt out of taking the medicine if they prefer, but obstetricians say most do not.",
      "Other medical centers have been less enthusiastic about low-dose aspirin.",
      "Northwell Health, the largest health care system in New York, does not universally recommend low-dose aspirin for all pregnant patients, according to Dr. Matthew Blitz, director of clinical research for the division of maternal-fetal medicine at Northwell Health.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to do no harm, so giving it to everyone, including people who don\u2019t need it, is still a big concern,\u201d Blitz said.",
      "Still, he noted that the screening tool is \u201cextremely time-consuming\u201d and it\u2019s possible that Northwell might eventually decide to recommend low-dose aspirin for all pregnant patients.",
      "Jones, the mom in California, said she hopes the new report will make a difference.",
      "Last year, she became pregnant again, and even though the guidelines say she should have received aspirin \u2014 a history of pre-eclampsia is one of the criteria \u2014 she says her doctors didn\u2019t suggest it until she was six months along, many weeks later than recommended.",
      "She developed pre-eclampsia again, with dangerously high blood pressure and blurry vision.",
      "\u201cDoctors need to tell people about this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me angry \u2014 like what the heck is going on in this system?\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 A flap of outrage is brewing over the fate of 15 residents of a cramped central London building, who critics say live out their lives indoors with no daylight, fresh air or adequately deep water.",
      "The gentoo penguins are one of the star attractions at the Sea Life London Aquarium, in one of the city\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots, across the river from the British Parliament and nestled between a \u201cShrek\u201d-themed experience and the popular London Eye landmark.",
      "British lawmakers this week joined campaigners in voicing mounting concerns for their 15 feathered neighbors, calling for government intervention over what they say is \u201cun-British\u201d treatment.",
      "The company that owns the aquarium says its penguin enclosure meets the standards of modern zoo practice set by the government.",
      "Visitors file past sharks, turtles and tropical fish in big tanks to reach the penguins, housed in a noticeably colder exhibit, built of rocks and artificial snow cliffs that hover over a pool of water.",
      "There, the 10 females and five males appear to spend their time mostly bobbing, jumping and swooshing through the water while visitors look on, children squealing with excitement while adults whip out their phones to take pictures.",
      "Most people filing by Thursday, largely families with children, told NBC News they were not aware of the brewing controversy.",
      "Shivani Gupta, visiting from Canada, said the conditions in the enclosure \u201cdid not seem right,\u201d although she added she would have still visited the aquarium as she has never seen penguins before.",
      "Chelsea Gibbons, 25, on vacation from Massachusetts, said she was not aware of the concerns raised by the campaigners, but noted there was no access to the outdoors for the penguins and the pool area appeared \u201ca bit small,\u201d although there is an additional area for the penguins to waddle around. Had she known about the efforts to free the birds ahead of time, Gibbon said, she would not have come. \u201cThe aquarium is saying it\u2019s meeting the standards, but we can always improve those standards,\u201d she added.",
      "Dozens of British lawmakers have signed an open letter to Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds asking her to \u201cconsider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioral, ecological and physiological needs,\u201d according to British media reports.",
      "David Taylor, a member of Parliament with the ruling Labour Party, has been spearheading the campaign, posting on X that \u201cabusing animals for money is un-British.\u201d",
      "The largest populations of gentoo penguins are found in the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia Islands in the South Atlantic, and on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Rory Wilson, a professor of aquatic biology at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, told NBC News that in the wild, gentoo penguins routinely dive up to more than 160 feet deep.",
      "\u201cI know that the official guidelines for captive penguins is that they need at least 4 feet of water depth, which I don\u2019t know who thought of that. It clearly wasn\u2019t someone who thought much about penguins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are monstrously efficient, wonderful swimmers. They are one of the fastest penguins, most athletic, and therefore any condition that they are being kept in captivity, which constrains their ability to move themselves, is obviously of concern,\u201d he said.",
      "As far as fresh air and daylight are concerned, Wilson said, some subspecies of gentoo could struggle to survive outside in the U.K. due to a risk of fungal infections.",
      "Freedom for Animals, a U.K. charity that opposes the captivity of animals in \u201czoos, aquariums, mobile zoos and circuses,\u201d launched a campaign to free the penguins in February 2024, but the movement has picked up steam with a protest held outside the facility last month and the intervention from MPs.",
      "A petition started by the charity has garnered more than 40,000 signatures and asks theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which owns the aquarium, to guarantee the \u201csafe and permanent retirement of the penguins\u201d to a facility that can provide \u201ca much more suitable environment.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Merlin Entertainments said the penguin enclosure is located on the ground floor of the aquarium, not the basement, and was \u201ccarefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins\u2019 natural environment as closely as possible to ensure good health, including climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air.\u201d",
      "The company also said the enclosure has technology that creates appropriate seasonal lighting, reflecting changing seasons. The penguin colony is regularly inspected by independent veterinarians, and local and national authorities, it added.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what\u2019s best for the animals. We\u2019re open. We\u2019re listening. And we\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That\u2019s a commitment we stand by.\u201d"

      "TikTokers are putting their family members on blast.",
      "On social media, users are sharing the kinds of text messages they receive from family members that you simply have to \"read and move on.\"",
      "The trend consists of creators sharing screenshots of funny texts from parents, siblings and more. The messages range from moms' overly concerned messages to dads' out of pocket jokes.",
      "One video that's amassed more than 700,000 likes is from creator Audrey Saxton of Dallas, Texas. The 27-year-old shared a screenshot of a funny conversation she had with her father.",
      "At the beginning of the message, Saxton's dad reminded her to wish her mother a \"happy mom day.\" But when she asked if there are any pictures from when she was a baby, her father responded with a surprising question.",
      "\"Who is this,\" he replied.",
      "\u201cSometimes you have to read your dads text and move on,\u201d she wrote over a screenshot of the message.",
      "Saxton tells TODAY.com that she responded to her dad's message with \"15 question marks.\" And in true dad joke fashion, he replied he was \"just kidding.\"",
      "\"Our texts messages never make any sense. They are always shorthanded or someone\u2019s responding days later and I knew that we would have something funny,\" she says.",
      "In another viral video, 25-year-old Ohio native Rania Saleh shared a series of text messages with her niece.",
      "In the screenshot, Saleh's 16-year-old niece, Riyah, told her she misses her. After Saleh responded, \"I actually miss you more,\" her niece explained why she started thinking of her.",
      "\"I thought about you today bc in ap psych we learned about how peoples mental and physical health starts to decline in their mid twenties,\" the 16-year-old wrote.",
      "Like viewers, Saleh tells TODAY.com she burst out laughing once she read the message.",
      "\"I gasped and just died laughing!\" she says. \"I was like, wow, I guess I really am entering my mid-20s but I\u2019m going to prove her psych teacher wrong! I\u2019m happy she thought of me but I was just shocked that that\u2019s what reminded her to text me and check in!\"",
      "\"Although it was super funny, it was also really sweet of her,\" she adds. \"I remember sending the text to all of my siblings, including her mom and they were all like 'Yup! That sounds like something Riyah would send.' It made everyone\u2019s day.\"",
      "The \"read and move on\" trend has resonated with social users because of its relatability.",
      "Oluwaseye Oyelowo, a 25-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, agrees. When she heard about the trend, she decided to get in on the fun by roasting her 22-year-old sister, Oluwasayo.",
      "\"I felt like people should see the funny relationship that I have with my younger sister and how comfortable she is with me,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "In her post, Oluwasayo out of the blue asked her older sister, \"When do you get paid and how much can I get?\"",
      "Oyelowo says with a laugh that the message is true to form for her sister.",
      "\"Growing up it was mainly my mom providing for us and now that I\u2019m working, I always make it be known that they can ask for anything, just to help remove a load off our mother. So yes, that is the normal for us,\" she says. \u201cShe\u2019s very forward with her requests and I just chuckle because I know her and read her message in her voice.\"",
      "So much so that sometimes, \"you have to look at your sister's text message and move on with your day,\" as Oyelowo captioned the video.",
      "Oyelowo also received a fitting reaction from her sister once she told her their messages went viral.",
      "\"I called my sister and said \u2018You\u2019re famous,\u2019\u201d Oyelowo says with a laugh. \"And she said she\u2019s putting interest on the money she wanted me to give for using her.\""

In the book and series, Marissa and Peter Irvine's lives are thrown into turmoil when their young son Milo goes missing during a playdate. It turns out he's been kidnapped, just as Mara feared in her own imagination.",
      "Beyond the unguessable twists, \u201cAll Her Fault\u201d is starting conversations about division of labor and why women bear the brunt of the responsibility for day-to-day life and are blamed when it goes awry. The show\u2019s main husbands, Peter (Jake Lacy) and Richie (Thomas Cocquerel), are on a spectrum of problematic, ranging from sociopathic to inept.",

      "While she says her husband is nothing like Richie, who leaves his wife to figure out all the details of their child\u2019s life, she did often feel like the \u201cdefault parent,\u201d forced to do more of the problem-solving.",
      "Mara, who describes herself as an \u201coverthinker,\u201d says she uses her novels as a way to work through scenarios.",

      "She has a 28-page-long document with a running list of ideas for crime novels inspired by real-life scenarios.",
      "Her next book, \u201cIt Should Have Been You,\u201d out in 2026, imagines what might happen if someone sent a mean text about a neighbor to the neighborhood group text. Then, four people wind up dead.",

      "Jessi Ngatikaura was happy to hear this reassurance from her husband but expressed her concerns.",
      "\"Throughout this whole separation, I've been in limbo of like really not knowing what I wanted and I'm still scared. My biggest fear is that we're going to move back in together and get back together and give it a chance and it's just going to go right back to how it was, and that's it's easy to just get comfortable and fall back into old patterns, you know? So I am really scared of that if I'm being honest,\" she said.",

And not that it makes your behavior OK, but I understand it now and it's changing, which is the most important part,\" Jessi Ngatikaura said, adding that she's also made her own progress with being more emotionally available for her husband.",
      "In a confessional interview, Jessi Ngatikaura opened up about what therapy has taught her about herself.",
      "\"I've seen how being avoidant has hurt my relationships. And in our culture, there is a lot of pressure to have the perfect relationship, the perfect family and everything's great. And I think that it kind of taught me these patterns to go numb and avoid and pretend everything's OK,\" she said.",
      "\"And if I'm going to make the marriage work, I need to drop that and I'm willing to do that because Jordan has made so many changes. And I want to make sure that I'm doing the same thing.\""

      "\u201cSo now when I watch a Hallmark Christmas movie, I really feel like my mom\u2019s there. There\u2019s always a happy ending. There\u2019s always just like fun and joy in these movies. They just mean a lot. And so it\u2019s just incredible to be here.\u201d",
      "Quinn then hitched a ride to the premiere with the cast of the film, which includes Matthew Daddario, Tracy Pollan, Steve Schirripa, Holland Roden, Caroline Aaron, Joe Pantoliano and Patti Murin.",
      "\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d she said.",
      "In the film, Daddario and Roden play characters whose families love the Bills.",
      "\u201cIt feels like one of those holiday yester-year movies,\u201d Roden told Quinn. \u201cIt has a lot of nostalgia from like either the 1970s, 1990s, football mania.\u201d",
      "Murin is a veteran of the Hallmark movie circuit, who addressed the chatter that this film may have been inspired by Bills quarterback Josh Allen\u2019s marriage to Hailee Steinfeld.",
      "\u201cWell, I know that he was getting married right when we were filming it,\u201d she told Quinn. \u201cSo, that was really cool to be here while they were in their offseason, but doing some life things.\u201d",
      "Schirripa, who\u2019s known for his work on \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d said Hallmark movies offer a nice alternative.",
      "\u201cYou know what\u2019s great about Hallmark? There\u2019s no shooting, no killing, no arguing,\u201d he told Quinn.",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story\u201d features cameos by a few Bills players, including Damar Hamlin, DeWayne Carter and Ray Davis.",
      "Carter said he may do more acting down the line.",
      "\u201cI mean, of course. You know, a fun fact about me, I\u2019m actually a theatre minor,\u201d he said.",
      "Davis, meanwhile, is in awe that he was part of the film.",
      "\u201cIt was insane. It was crazy, just to be able to even say I\u2019m even in a movie,\u201d he said.",
      "Quinn then participated in Hallmark\u2019s festive \u201cPeppermint Procession\u201d from the red carpet to the movie theater, with fans cheering \u201cLet\u2019s go Buffalo!\u201d along the way, while snow fell from the sky.",
      "\u201cThis night just keeps getting better! It\u2019s like the end of a Hallmark movie when it suddenly starts to snow,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story\u201d premieres Nov. 22 at 8 p.m. ET. It will stream the next day on Hallmark+."

      "Tom Bergeron's return to \"Dancing With the Stars\" this week caused major drama with Season 27 champion Bobby Bones.",
      "In a Nov. 12 Instagram video, Bones shared that it was \"hurtful\" hearing former host Bergeron's comments about his controversial win with pro Sharna Burgess in 2019 and also revealed that he returned his Mirrorball trophy to ABC.",
      "Bergeron served as a guest judge on the dance competition\u2019s Nov. 11 \"20th Birthday Party\" episode. During an interview with Parade ahead of the episode, he was asked to name the most surprising eliminations from his years as host.",
      "\"The thing that shocked me most was a win \u2014\u00a0Bobby Bones,\" he responded. \"That was when I went, 'Uhh.' .... Bobby Bones was the first time ... it was like, 'Ouch.' No disrespect to Bobby. He would probably say the same thing.\"",
      "Bones clapped back at Bergeron's snub in his video.",
      "\"This was hurtful and not because of what was said, but really who said it ... Am I supposed to not show up and work hard? Am I supposed to not give it freaking everything that I have? Am I supposed to throw it and not win?\u201d he said.",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy the amount of hate I get even from people that I respect like Tom Bergeron there and Julianne Hough ...I feel like a sixth-grader and all the 9th grade dancing kids are shoving me in lockers,\" Bones continued. (Hough appeared on \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\" in August 2024 and agreed with fellow guest Mickey Guyton that Bones was the winner they \"strongly disagreed with,\" E! News reported at the time. Hough also said Bones \"was not the best dancer.\")",
      "The radio host said the many \"random shots\" he's received from DWTS personalities have \"taken all the joy\" out of his win.",
      "\u201cI had a great attitude, I worked hard and here we are six years later, I\u2019m still catching strays out of nowhere,\" he said. \"So I sent the trophy back. They don't want me to be a part of the show, obviously.\"",
      "Bones did not clarify in the clip when he decided to return his Mirrorball trophy.",
      "Following Bones' video, Bergeron apologized in a direct message, sharing a screenshot of it on his Instagram story.",
      "\u201cBobby, it wasn\u2019t my intention to hurt your feelings. My \u2018ouch\u2019 was based on my honest feeling that your win spoke to a need to address the balance between judge and viewer voting,\" Bergeron wrote.",
      "He further explained, \"I always felt bad that both you & Sharna had to deal with the aftermath of that win & I certainly regret pouring any salt into that old wound.\"",
      "At the top of his screenshot, Bergeron wrote, \"I was doing so many interviews leading up to the 20th, I was bound to say something inelegantly,\" and added a facepalming emoji.",
      "Bones and Burgess won Season 27 in 2018, besting runners-up Milo Manheim and pro Witney Carson. When the competition show returned for Season 28, a new element was added that allowed the judges to save one of the bottom two couples every week.",
      "Currently, the judges' scores are combined with the viewers' votes every week to determine who goes home."

    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian said she had no room for error when it came to the California bar exam.",
      "In the latest episode of \"The Kardashians,\" which was filmed three months before Kardashian took the bar exam and failed, she explained why she needed to pass the test on the first try.",
      "The reality TV star said she spent about \"nine hours a day\" studying and was happy to wrap her Hulu show \"All's Fair\" so she could focus more on her studies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really just excited to have \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019 wrapped and behind me so that I can just dive right on into studying and make that my No. 1 focus,\" she said on Season 7, Episode 4, of the series.",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian admitted that she was feeling \"exhausted.\"",
      "When a producer asked her if she was \"nervous\" about taking the bar, she responded, yes.",
      "\u201cYeah! Absolutely. I\u2019m not ready yet,\" she said. \"You know, you feel like you don\u2019t know anything and then it all clicks and then you feel like you don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s just the craziest, most emotional roller coaster.\"",
      "\"I really do need to pass on the first try,\" Kardashian added. \"I don\u2019t have another few months I can give up.\"",
      "The State Bar of California released the results of its July 2025 exam on Nov. 7, announcing that 54.8% of exam takers passed. Just over 7,300 people took the test, 73.9% of which were first-time test takers. The pass rate for first-time takers was 69.7%, per the state bar.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s name was not included in the publicly available pass list.",
      "She spoke about failing the bar in a TikTok video that she filmed while getting ready for her mother's 70th birthday party. Kardashian told someone on the phone that fortune tellers had inaccurately predicted her future.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just letting you guys know that all of the f--king psychics that we have met with and that we\u2019re obsessed with are all f--king full of s--t,\" she said angrily. \u201cThey all collectively \u2014 maybe four of them have told me that I was going to pass the bar, so they\u2019re all full pathological liars. Don't believe anything they say.\"",
      "Last May, Kardashian completed her law program after six years of studying. Now that she's failed the bar, she'll have to re-take the test. The bar is given twice a year, in July and February."

      "Small business owners Jaclyn and Kevin Elbaum are always tickled pink when someone wears one of their beautiful pieces of jewelry. But they were enchanted to see one of the world's biggest stars sporting not one, but two special items from their collection last week.",
      "On Nov. 5, Taylor Swift was spotted wearing a stunning yellow gold diamond lock necklace and a diamond chain lariat during a date night with fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce in New York City.",
      "Word quickly spread that the items came from the Elbaums\u2019 brand, Audry Rose, which the couple founded in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a top 10 life moment kind of thing,\u201d Kevin Elbaum tells TODAY.com in a joint interview with his wife, calling the experience \u201csurreal.\u201d",
      "The married couple first learned that Swift was a fan of their jewelry while they were sitting down to dinner with their family.",
      "\u201cOne of my friends, she just saw it and she calls me and was like, \u2018I think this is your necklace.\u2019 And so I open up Instagram and I zoom in and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, that is my necklace,\u2019\u201d Jaclyn Elbaum recalls.",
      "The mother of two's animated reaction initially concerned her husband.",

      "He decided to film his wife's reaction and post it on Instagram. In the video, Jaclyn Elbaum holds back tears as she looks at the photo of Swift wearing the two necklaces.",
      "The couple was especially touched by Swift's selections. The \"Life of a Showgirl\" singer wore two pieces from their collection that hold special meaning to their family.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum designed the Pave Diamond Lock Necklace around five years ago and says the piece is \u201creally close to my heart.\u201d",
      "Every part of the necklace is handmade, including the chain, which is named after the couple\u2019s daughter Sloan.",
      "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have picked a more important piece to us,\u201d Kevin Elbaum adds.",

      "A Life-Changing Moment for a Small Business",
      "The Elbaums are the latest small business owners to experience the \"Taylor Swift effect,\" referring to the singer's cultural and economic influence. Other examples include the NFL's increase in female viewership after Swift started dating Kelce and jewelry designer Kindred Lubeck's explosion in social media followers after Kelce proposed with one of her rings.",
      "Even in their wildest dreams, the Elbaums had never imagined something like this could happen to their small business.",
      "\"We don\u2019t have a publicist or anything. We hadn\u2019t tried to get it to her, so we really were completely blindsided that this could even happen. We assumed the only way it could happen was if you got it to her stylist or something,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Ever since the photo of Swift wearing their jewelry went viral, the Elbaums have noticed an uptick in traffic to their brand\u2019s website and more people purchasing the $7,800 lock necklace.",
      "They\u2019ve since added a sterling silver version of the lock necklace that retails for $890.",
      "The Elbaums say they're incredibly grateful for Swift's support of small businesses.",
      "\"We would have paid her to have the necklace. This is clearly a passion project for her to just sprinkle the Taylor aura around to businesses she likes, so it\u2019s really special,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum adds that Swift \"clearly cares about the craft and how things are made.\"",
      "After seeing the photo of Swift wearing items from their brand, the Elbaums emailed the singer's team to express their gratitude.",
      "\"I appreciate what she does to all small businesses, not just ours. It's really a special thing to see,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "A Launchpad for a 'New Phase'",
      "The Elbaums started Audry Rose in 2015 shortly after Jaclyn Elbaum's grandmother, the brand's namesake, passed away.",
      "\"She started in the clothing industry and was entrepreneurial before that was really a thing for women. She was really ahead of her time and I always looked up to her. She was always a role model for me. Quality of things was always very important to her, so we wanted that to be infused into the brand,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "Before the launch of their brand, Kevin Elbaum specialized in customer acquisition while Jaclyn Elbaum worked in the fashion industry.",
      "\u201cI always really wanted to do something with her, and it was just getting her over her fear to jump with me,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "The Elbaums say it'll be a long time before they're able to shake off the feeling of seeing Swift wearing one of their designs.",
      "Looking ahead, the couple hopes this is simply the beginning of a new phase for their brand.",
      "\"I want everyone to know quality for us is really important and I hope other people trust our brand like she did,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says. \"We\u2019re just really excited to keep going, keep designing, keep growing.\"",

      "The finale of the Apple TV+ show ended with Ricky Martin\u2019s character, Robert, accidentally getting shot by Mary (Julia Duffy) after she attempted to assassinate President Nixon. The final scene showed Robert, who was pretending to be Astronaut Grant, bleeding on the floor.",
      "With Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d premiering Nov. 12, fans are curious to know: Is Robert dead?",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019re not saying he (dies),\u201d creator Abe Sylvia previously told TODAY.com following the 2024 finale. \u201cThis is a classic soap opera cliffhanger.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe wanted to start with a bang. I\u2019m such a huge fan of movie musicals. I started as a dancer myself, and so I brought a whole book full of inspirations to the designers and brought in the choreographer,\u201d Sylvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mash up of a lot of my personal influences, and I was just so grateful that everybody brought their A-game and that we were able to make the musical number of my dreams.\u201d",

She hides underneath the hospital bed as Norma walks in and the doctor tells her that Robert is \u201ctouch and go,\u201d leaning on go. If he does wake up, the doctor says, his speech will be their first sign of hope and from there they will assess for any brain damage.",
      "After the doctor leaves, Norma talks to an unconscious Robert and tells him, \u201cI know who told you about Agnes.\u201d",
      "By the end of the episode, Robert opens his eyes and simply says, \u201cAgnes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I read the last episode last season and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, am I dying?\u2019 and then Abe told me, \u2018Oh, Ricky, I\u2019m sorry I forgot to tell you, you\u2019re not going to die,\u2019\u201d Martin tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I am open to anything.\u201d",
      "Kristen Wiig adds that \u201cit\u2019s been hard to keep\u201d Robert\u2019s fate a secret, \u201cbecause people have seen photos. So it\u2019s been really hard for us to be like, \u2018Is he a ghost?\u2019\u201d",

      "As the experiment continued, Jalyn and Josh began to experience a few hiccups, including differing opinions on whether they should still follow their exes on social media. Above all, Josh's love for music festivals, particularly Burning Man, was a sticking point for the couple.",

And so with decision day coming up, I'm hoping she feels the same way,\" Josh says in a confessional interview.",

It's not because I'm trying to be like, 'How can we move it all over here so you can stop going over there?'

That's where I stress out,\" she says, calling it her \"worry\" about their relationship.",
      "Josh reassures his wife and says that he can see where she's coming from.",
      "\"At the end of the day, music is a really big part of what I enjoy  but it's not who I am. If I really think about it, there's a lot of things about me that make me who I am way outside of that,\" he says.",
      "Jalyn then suggests that her husband could still attend the Burning Man festival this year then they could take a couple's trip and go on a retreat or something similar.",
      "\"I'll be completely honest with you, babe. I've literally already thought of myself at Burning Man without you and I already feel like it's not gonna be the same,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see himself going without her.",
      "In a confessional interview, Jalyn then explains her position further.",
      "\"I think Josh is really good at making me feel reassured but these are things that could potentially be easier said than done. You know, I could see myself spending forever with him. I think my biggest fear is he's just telling me what I want to hear so I just say yes by the end of this,\" she says.",
      "Back at dinner, Jalyn applauds her husband and says she wants him to be happy.",
      "\"No matter what happens on decision day, I want you to know I think that you're such an incredible person and I think you're deserving of everything you want,\" she says.",
      "At the end of the eight-week experiment, Jalyn and Josh will need to decide if they want to stay married or go their separate ways. They are one of five couples who got married at first sight this season, including Jalyn's mother, Belynda, a 47-year-old esthetic consultant who tied the knot with Chad, a 54-year-old real estate executive ."

      "LONDON \u2014 A flap of outrage is brewing over the fate of 15 residents of a cramped central London building, who critics say live out their lives indoors with no daylight, fresh air or adequately deep water.",
      "The gentoo penguins are one of the star attractions at the Sea Life London Aquarium, in one of the city\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots, across the river from the British Parliament and nestled between a \u201cShrek\u201d-themed experience and the popular London Eye landmark.",
      "British lawmakers this week joined campaigners in voicing mounting concerns for their 15 feathered neighbors, calling for government intervention over what they say is \u201cun-British\u201d treatment.",
      "The company that owns the aquarium says its penguin enclosure meets the standards of modern zoo practice set by the government.",
      "Visitors file past sharks, turtles and tropical fish in big tanks to reach the penguins, housed in a noticeably colder exhibit, built of rocks and artificial snow cliffs that hover over a pool of water.",
      "There, the 10 females and five males appear to spend their time mostly bobbing, jumping and swooshing through the water while visitors look on, children squealing with excitement while adults whip out their phones to take pictures.",
      "Most people filing by Thursday, largely families with children, told NBC News they were not aware of the brewing controversy.",
      "Shivani Gupta, visiting from Canada, said the conditions in the enclosure \u201cdid not seem right,\u201d although she added she would have still visited the aquarium as she has never seen penguins before.",
      "Chelsea Gibbons, 25, on vacation from Massachusetts, said she was not aware of the concerns raised by the campaigners, but noted there was no access to the outdoors for the penguins and the pool area appeared \u201ca bit small,\u201d although there is an additional area for the penguins to waddle around. Had she known about the efforts to free the birds ahead of time, Gibbon said, she would not have come. \u201cThe aquarium is saying it\u2019s meeting the standards, but we can always improve those standards,\u201d she added.",
      "Dozens of British lawmakers have signed an open letter to Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds asking her to \u201cconsider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioral, ecological and physiological needs,\u201d according to British media reports.",
      "David Taylor, a member of Parliament with the ruling Labour Party, has been spearheading the campaign, posting on X that \u201cabusing animals for money is un-British.\u201d",
      "The largest populations of gentoo penguins are found in the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia Islands in the South Atlantic, and on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Rory Wilson, a professor of aquatic biology at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, told NBC News that in the wild, gentoo penguins routinely dive up to more than 160 feet deep.",
      "\u201cI know that the official guidelines for captive penguins is that they need at least 4 feet of water depth, which I don\u2019t know who thought of that. It clearly wasn\u2019t someone who thought much about penguins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are monstrously efficient, wonderful swimmers. They are one of the fastest penguins, most athletic, and therefore any condition that they are being kept in captivity, which constrains their ability to move themselves, is obviously of concern,\u201d he said.",
      "As far as fresh air and daylight are concerned, Wilson said, some subspecies of gentoo could struggle to survive outside in the U.K. due to a risk of fungal infections.",
      "Freedom for Animals, a U.K. charity that opposes the captivity of animals in \u201czoos, aquariums, mobile zoos and circuses,\u201d launched a campaign to free the penguins in February 2024, but the movement has picked up steam with a protest held outside the facility last month and the intervention from MPs.",
      "A petition started by the charity has garnered more than 40,000 signatures and asks theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which owns the aquarium, to guarantee the \u201csafe and permanent retirement of the penguins\u201d to a facility that can provide \u201ca much more suitable environment.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Merlin Entertainments said the penguin enclosure is located on the ground floor of the aquarium, not the basement, and was \u201ccarefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins\u2019 natural environment as closely as possible to ensure good health, including climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air.\u201d",
      "The company also said the enclosure has technology that creates appropriate seasonal lighting, reflecting changing seasons. The penguin colony is regularly inspected by independent veterinarians, and local and national authorities, it added.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what\u2019s best for the animals. We\u2019re open. We\u2019re listening. And we\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That\u2019s a commitment we stand by.\u201d"

      "As a result, European leaders have backed plans for a \u201cdrone wall,\u201d a network of sensors and weapons to detect, track and neutralize intruding UAVs, and in Riga, the team at a small tech company called Origin is on the forefront of this new, high-tech battleground.",
      "Its solution, a 3-foot-tall interceptor drone named \u201cBlaze.\u201d Powered by an artificial intelligence system, it has been trained to recognize a hostile target and navigate close to it. It will then alert a human operator, who will make a decision on whether to intercept and push a button which explodes a 28-ounce warhead, self-destructing the drone and hopefully bringing down its target too.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t fly these systems. These systems fly themselves,\u201d Origin  CEO Agris Kipurs told NBC News last week in an interview outside the factory, adding that Blaze addressed \u201cthe problem of relatively cheap, low-flying threats that are deployed in volumes.\u201d",
      "Kipurs, who previously developed drones to follow and film extreme sports athletes, said he pivoted to focus on defense technology after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The Ukrainian government estimates Russia is now making more than 300 drones a day at the cost of just a few thousand dollars \u2014 each enough to pound the capital, Kyiv, and other cities with massive aerial attacks every night.",
      "Ukraine has also turned to relatively cheap drone technologies in a bid to offset Russia numerical advantages on the battlefield; last year, it became the first country to establish a separate branch of the military dedicated to drones."

      "Pope Leo XIV welcomed Spike Lee, Cate Blanchett, Greta Gerwig and dozens of other Hollywood luminaries to a special Vatican audience Saturday celebrating cinema and its ability to inspire and unite.",
      "Leo encouraged the filmmakers and celebrities gathered in a frescoed Vatican audience hall to use their art to include marginal voices, calling film \u201ca popular art in the noblest sense, intended for and accessible to all.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen cinema is authentic, it does not merely console, but challenges,\u201d he told the stars. \u201cIt articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express.\u201d",
      "The encounter, organized by the Vatican\u2019s culture ministry, follows on similar audiences Pope Francis had in recent years with artists and comedians. It\u2019s part of the Vatican\u2019s efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "But the gathering also seemed to have particular meaning for history\u2019s first American pope, who grew up in the heyday of Hollywood. The 70-year-old, Chicago-born Leo just this week identified his four favorite films: \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d and \u201cLife Is Beautiful.\u201d",
      "In a sign of how seemingly star-struck he was, Leo spent nearly an hour after the audience greeting and chatting amiably with each of the participants, something he rarely does for large audiences.",
      "Drawing applause from the celebrities, Leo acknowledged that the film industry and cinemas around the world were experiencing a decline, with theaters that had once been important social and cultural meeting points disappearing from neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cI urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\u201d of movie theaters, he said.",
      "Celebrities just happy to be invited",
      "Many celebrities said they found Leo\u2019s words inspiring, and expressed awe as they walked through the halls of the Vatican Apostolic Palace, where a light luncheon reception awaited them after the audience.",
      "\u201cIt was a surprise to me that I even got invited,\u201d Spike Lee told reporters along the red carpet gauntlet in the palace.",
      "During the audience, Lee had presented Leo with a jersey from his beloved Knicks basketball team, featuring the number 14 and Leo\u2019s name on the back. Leo is a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks now boasts three players from the pope\u2019s alma mater, Villanova University.",
      "Blanchett, for her part, said the pope\u2019s comments were inspiring because he understood the crucial role cinema can play in transcending borders and exploring sometimes difficult subjects in ways that aren\u2019t divisive.",
      "\u201cFilmmaking is about entertainment, but it\u2019s about including voices that are often marginalized and not shy away from the pain and complexity that we\u2019re all living through right now,\u201d she said.",
      "She said Leo, in his comments about the experience of watching a film in a dark theatre, clearly understood the culturally important role cinemas can play.",
      "\u201cSitting in the dark with strangers is a way in which we can reconnect to what unites us rather than what divides us,\u201d she said.",
      "A \u2018hit and miss\u2019 guest list that grew",
      "The gathering drew a diverse group of filmmakers and actors, including many from Italy, like Monica Bellucci and Alba Rohrwacher. American actors included Chris O\u2019Donnell, Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann, his wife.",
      "Archbishop Paul Tighe, the No. 2 in the Vatican culture ministry, said the guest list was pulled together just in the last three months, with the help of the handful of contacts Vatican officials had in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese.",
      "The biggest hurdle, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation to come meet Leo wasn\u2019t a hoax. In the end, as word spread, some figures approached the Vatican and asked to be invited.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an industry where people have their commitments months in advance and years in advance, so obviously it was a little hit and miss, but we\u2019re very pleased and very proud\u201d by the turnout, he said.",
      "The aim of the encounter, he said, was to encourage an ongoing conversation with the world of culture, of which film is a fundamental part.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very democratic art form,\u201d Tighe said. Saturday\u2019s audience, he said, was \u201cthe celebration of an art form that I think is touching the lives of so many people and therefore recognizing it and giving it its true importance.\u201d"

      "The Chinese outrage is directed at Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who told lawmakers last week that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo, an unusually explicit statement that experts say is a first for a sitting Japanese prime minister.",
      "China, which claims the self-ruling island democracy as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force against it, has demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks.",
      "Others have gone further: One prominent Chinese commentator called Takaichi an \u201cevil witch,\u201d while a Chinese diplomat in Japan talked about cutting off the \u201cdirty neck\u201d extending itself into what Beijing considers an internal matter.",
      "Both countries have summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors as the saga enters its second week, and on Friday China advised its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan, citing \"significant risks\" to their personal safety.",
      "The war of words underscores the complicated relationship between China and Japan, which are major trading partners but have modern territorial disputes as well as lasting historical tensions over Japan\u2019s World War II-era occupation of China.",
      "It was only two weeks ago that Takaichi, who last month became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, during which they agreed to pursue stable ties.",
      "Like its ally the United States, Japan has traditionally been vague as to how far it would go to protect Taiwan \u2014 which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory \u2014 against Chinese military aggression.",
      "But Takaichi, a China hard-liner who has long advocated for Taiwan, told lawmakers last week that Chinese use of force around Taiwan could qualify as \u201can existential threat,\u201d triggering a military response.",
      "Though former Japanese leaders \u2014 including Takaichi\u2019s mentor, the late Shinzo Abe \u2014 have made similar comments about military action after leaving office, \u201cit\u2019s breaking new ground for a sitting prime minister to state this,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News.",
      "The reaction from China was strong and swift, with one comment in particular getting the most attention.",
      "\u201cThe dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,\u201d Xue Jian, the Chinese consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, said in a post on X that has since been deleted.",
      "The Japanese government says it continues to favor a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and has criticized Xue\u2019s \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d remarks, which some interpreted as a death threat against Takaichi.",

      "On Friday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, to lodge a protest over Xue\u2019s post.",
      "China said later Friday that Wu had himself \u201csummoned Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Takehiro Funakoshi, to lodge solemn representations\u201d and assail Takaichi for failing to retract her comments, which it said \u201cviolated basic common sense, crossed China\u2019s red line, constituted a military threat, and amounted to war-mongering.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Beijing summoned the Japanese ambassador, Kenji Kanasugi, to warn him over Taiwan.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of National Defense also issued a warning on Friday, saying that Japan would \u201cinevitably crash against the steel wall\u201d of the Chinese military if it intervenes in the Taiwan Strait, \u201cpaying a bitter and heavy price.\u201d",
      "Takaichi has also been excoriated in Chinese state media. A Friday editorial in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper said the Taiwan remarks by Takaichi, who has vowed to increase defense spending and favors revising Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, were \u201caimed at finding an excuse for Japan\u2019s military expansion.\u201d",
      "Hu Xijin, a Chinese nationalist commentator, said Takaichi was an \u201cevil witch\u201d who had \u201csuccessfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, which was ruled by China\u2019s Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895 and by Japan from 1895 to 1945, has emphasized its sovereignty and noted Beijing\u2019s escalating military activity in the Taiwan Strait.",

      "China\u2019s harsh response will only \u201cenhance her reputation\u201d among conservatives in Japan, Kingston said. It could also give her a boost with President Donald Trump, who seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during his visit to Japan last month.",
      "\u201cTaking a hard line on China doesn\u2019t really hurt her in terms of bilateral relations with the United States,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Because China is so sensitive to the issue of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d its rebuke of Takaichi\u2019s comments is also unsurprising, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Australia.",

      "Describing President Donald Trump as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d who \u201cwants to frighten us,\u201d Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary and one of the few international leaders willing to openly criticize his American counterpart, called the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean \u201cundoubtedly an aggression against Latin America.\u201d",
      "Colombia would not \u201cpass on the information because we would be collaborating with a crime against humanity,\u201d he told NBC News at the presidential palace in Bogota, reiterating a decision announced earlier this week.",
      "Acknowledging \u201cthe most key thing is intelligence\u201d in combating the drug trade, he added, \u201cThe more we coordinate intelligence, the better. That is what I have been doing. But intelligence is not for killing.\u201d",
      "Tensions have risen dramatically between Trump and Petro in recent weeks over the issue of American military attacks against boats allegedly carrying illegal narcotics in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, which have killed dozens. At least 19 strikes have been carried out so far, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump has justified them by saying the United States is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels and claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations that are flooding America\u2019s cities with drugs.",
      "But his administration has provided no evidence for these assertions and lawmakers, including Republicans, have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the strikes.",
      "A White House official said in an email Thursday that it was \u201chardly surprising\u201d that Petro was opposed to Trump\u2019s \u201csuccessful operations to halt the flow of drugs to our country.\u201d They added that Trump had directed the actions \u201cconsistent with his responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests.\u201d",

      "After Petro called a U.S. strike \u201cmurder\u201d in a post on X, Trump said he would cut aid and raise tariffs on Colombia. The Treasury Department subsequently hit his Colombian counterpart and members of his family with sanctions.",
      "Petro then announced this week that he was suspending intelligence sharing with Washington.",
      "The United Kingdom has also stopped sharing intelligence because of concerns about the legality of U.S. strikes, two sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "And French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also said at the start of a a Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting in Canada on Tuesday that the strikes \u201cviolate international law\u201d and were concerning for France\u2019s territories in the region.",
      "Petro did not say definitively that the boats that have been recently attacked were not carrying drugs. \u201cMaybe or maybe not. We do not know,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to due process, the civilized treatment of people, they \u200bshould be seized and detained.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are poor boatmen, they know how to drive a boat, they are hired in their poverty by the gangsters. But gangsters don\u2019t sit on the boats,\u201d he said. \u201cThen when one of those missiles arrives [it] kills that boatman. It doesn\u2019t kill the drug trafficker.\u201d",
      "His government, he said, \u201chas seized more cocaine than any other government in world history. Trump\u2019s insult is at odds reality, how can he call the largest destroyer of cocaine a chief trafficker?\u201d",
      "Petro strongly denied Trump\u2019s personal accusations, calling the president \"lost\" and suggesting that he was being misled by other U.S. officials on the issue. \u201cHe is lost on the issue of the real analysis of what is going on with cocaine in Colombia.\u201d",
      "Petro, who considers himself a left-wing revolutionary, added, \u201cHe is a barbarian, but anyone can change.\u201d",
      "The Colombian president is not the only leader in the region feeling pressure. Trump has also singled out the president of neighboring Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, as a target for his ire and leveled accusations of complicity in the drug trade against him, too.",

      "The band, one of the top-selling acts in the world, announced its intention to return to the label, Ador, in separate statements on Wednesday, with Haerin and Hyein confirming their decision first, followed by the other three members, Danielle, Minji and Hanni, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.",
      "Last year, NewJeans unilaterally announced a split from Ador, citing the agency\u2019s alleged failure to protect its members following the dismissal of Min Hee-jin, the former chief executive of Ador and the group\u2019s mentor. Ador denied the allegations.",
      "Last month, a South Korean court rejected NewJeans\u2019 argument, ruling that its exclusive contract with Ador remains valid as Min being CEO is not necessarily part of Ador\u2019s contractual obligations.",

      "\u201cOne member is currently in Antarctica, and thus our stance was delivered late,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs Ador is currently not responding, we are notifying it individually.\u201d",
      "In March, NewJeans announced a pause on all independent activities under its new name \u201cNJZ\u201d during a concert in Hong Kong, to the surprise of global fans and supporters. The announcement came after a ruling by a Seoul court in favor of Ador, which had filed an injunction against the group\u2019s independent activities.",
      "The group said it did not regret the choice to break from Ador \u201cat all\u201d and that they had to \u201cspeak up to protect the values\u201d they believe in.",

Japan is also experiencing an unusually early and harsh flu season that\u2019s \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Japanese news outlet Nippon TV reported that as of Nov. 4, flu cases in Tokyo had surged to nearly six times the level seen at this time last year, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. More than 2,300 day cares and schools in the country were at least partially closed because of the outbreak, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cThese are not good signs,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Is this flu strain already in the U.S.?",
      "H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\u2019t provided a detailed, national report on flu activity since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.",
      "Even if it reopens in the coming days, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said that the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the CDC in the form of massive layoffs could further delay flu data collection and analysis. Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would cut up to 10,000 full-time jobs in the public health sector.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be dependent on state laboratories and academic laboratories for these investigations and report them out,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cThe information will not be as comprehensive, centralized and as quickly analyzed and communicated from the CDC as we have had in previous years.\u201d",
      "Will this year\u2019s flu shot be helpful?",
      "Global health officials and drugmakers select which viral strain to include in fall flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere each year in February, based on which types are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. This year\u2019s flu shots protect against three strains of influenza, including two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B.",
      "The annual flu shot doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting infected with the flu. It\u2019s mainly used to lessen the severity of the illness. Last year, the vaccine was up to 55% effective in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital.",
      "On Tuesday, health authorities in the U.K. published preliminary evidence that this year\u2019s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults.",
      "Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway.",
      "\u201cAll of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,\u201d he said."
