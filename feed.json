      "San Francisco (AP) \u2014 A Northern California aquarium has raised more than $2 million for sea otter conservation in just two days. All it took was Taylor Swift wearing a vintage T-shirt.",
      "Swift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium otter conservation T-shirt in a release party movie for her new \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d album, sending her ardent fans on a quest to buy the shirt last produced in the 1990s. After the aquarium was flooded with calls about buying the T-shirt showing two otters floating on their back, it decided to re-release the garment Thursday as part of a special campaign to raise $1.3 million, a nod to Swift\u2019s favorite number, said Liz MacDonald, the aquarium\u2019s director of content strategy.",
      "The aquarium met and surpassed its goal to raise the funds for its sea otter conservation program in less than eight hours, averaging about $100,000 in sales every 15 minutes, MacDonald said. Donors who give at least $65.13 to its newest fundraising campaign to help injured and orphan otters will be mailed a T-shirt, MacDonald said.",
      "\u201cWe definitely had a little Taylor Swift dance party in the office yesterday afternoon when we hit the goal,\u201d she said.",
      "The aquarium began accepting back-orders and by Friday afternoon it had raised more than $2 million, according to its website.",
      "How Swift acquired the T-Shirt that was last produced more than 32 years ago \u2014 when she was just 3 years old \u2014 remains a mystery.",
      "She and fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce have been documented visiting nearby Carmel, but MacDonald said the aquarium is not aware of the couple having been in their shop.",
      "MacDonald said the staff has had fun speculating about Swift's interest in the T-shirt.",
      "When Taylor announced the release of her new album on Kelce\u2019s podcast \"New Heights\" a couple of weeks ago, the couple had a little banter about how he loves otters and loves sending her videos of the furry sea creatures.",
      "\u201cOne of my favorite theories is that we have a sea otter on our exhibit whose name is Opal and she was named by the fans through an online poll, and I wonder if Taylor Swift may have been one of the people that voted for the name Opal,\u201d MacDonald said, adding that opal is Kelce\u2019s birthstone and that Opalite is the name of one of Swift\u2019s songs.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kevin Federline says concern for his two sons with Britney Spears long kept him from telling his story, and those same concerns are the reason he's telling it now that they're men.",
      "In a memoir to be released Tuesday, \u201cYou Thought You Knew,\u201d Federline documents his difficult years as husband, ex-husband, and co-parent with Spears, who wrote her own memoir in 2023.",
      "Federline's includes some salacious stories and some potentially disturbing details about her behavior that have already made headlines.",
      "\u201cI want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there,\u201d Federline, 47, told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview, backed by palm trees in Hawaii, where he now lives with wife Victoria Prince and their two daughters. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very big part of this for me. And it\u2019s really important that I share my story, so they don\u2019t have to.\u201d",
      "He and Spears' son Preston is now 20 and his brother Jayden is 19. They have little relationship with their mother.",
      "Federline was a 26-year-old backup dancer for other major pop acts when he coupled with Spears in 2004. Their courtship, two-year marriage and divorce took them through one of the most intense celebrity media frenzies in modern history. Federline was ruthlessly roasted as a loser hanger-on, especially after he released his own deeply mocked hip-hop album.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t just famous \u2014 I was infamous,\u201d he writes.",
      "He told the AP he long considered writing the book, but recently got serious about it.",
      "\u201cI picked it up and put it down quite a lot over probably a five-year period,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a very good description of me, who I am, the father I\u2019ve become, the husband I am, the ex-husband I am.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Federline describes the night he and Spears first connected at a Hollywood nightclub, and how they hooked up hours later in a hotel bungalow: \u201cBritney turned around, slipped off her underwear and started kissing me, tearing at my clothes with both hands. We stumbled toward the bed while I struggled to kick my pants off my ankles. This. Is. Happening. OK, sorry. Calm down, that\u2019s as detailed as I\u2019m going to get.\u201d",
      "\u2014 He writes that a \u201cSan Andreas-level seismic shift in my reality\u201d followed a few hours later when he left the hotel with Spears and dozens of paparazzi cars followed them.",
      "\u2014 He describes the night before their wedding, when Spears called her ex Justin Timberlake, seeking closure: \u201cShe never really got over him. She might\u2019ve loved me, but there was something there with Justin that she couldn\u2019t let go of.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Federline said seeing Spears drinking while pregnant \u201ctripped the silent alarms in my head.\u201d He later was outraged when he saw her doing cocaine when the boys were still breastfeeding, saying \u201care you seriously going to go home after this and feed them like you don\u2019t have a body full of drugs?\u201d",
      "\u2014 He writes that Preston told him Spears mercilessly mocked him and once punched him in the face.",

      "The inventive R&B artist Ty Dolla $ign released his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cIt's \u2018Tycoon\u2019 season,'\u201d a beaming Ty Dolla $ign, declares.",
      "It is indeed. The inventive R&B singer has just released his fifth studio album, his first full-length solo release in five years. He chose \u201cTycoon\u201d for its title because the word encompasses his current state of mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like (being at) the top of your game,\" he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only have I done all the stuff you could do in artistry, (but) there\u2019s still more to do.\u201d",
      "Call it confidence or swagger or showboating: The Grammy-nominated artist has a trove of multiplatinum records to his name from 2018 to the present, and recently, his controversial project with Kanye West, $, released two albums, \u201cVultures 1\u201d and \u201cVultures 2\u201d in 2024. They debuted at No. 1 and 2 on the Billboard 200, respectively.",
      "\u201cTycoon\u201d is classic Ty Dolla $ign. The album is what he's made a name for himself doing: a collection of ceaselessly catchy, NSFW R&B anthems about lust and love (both mostly lechery), stacked with A-list collaborations: Quavo,Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Travis Scott, Chlo\u00eb \u2014 the list goes on.",
      "Also among them: Rappers Kodak Black and Ty Dolla $ign's longtime kindred spirit YG. (Ty Dolla $ign and YG have worked together for a number of years, certainly going back to 2010's \u201cToot It & Boot It.\") For his latest album, the trio teamed up for \u201cSMILE BODY PRETTY FACE.\u201d It was one of the last songs to make \u201cTycoon,\u201d says Ty Dolla $ign, \u201cBut when we started messing with the beat. I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm always loving something,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn't all the way worked out for me yet.\u201d Love, then, is still a constant source of inspiration \u2014 enriched by the song's sample of Wayne Wonders\u2019 2002 reggae fusion track \u201cNo Letting Go.\u201d",
      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be a comeback in R&B very soon,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe're talking Leon specifically.\u201d",

      "A German museum has been unexpectedly overrun by Taylor Swift fans",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A German museum has been unexpectedly overrun by Taylor Swift fans because one of its paintings bears a striking resemblance to the opening scene of Swift\u2019s current number one hit video, \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of additional visitors came to the Hessische Landesmuseum in central Germany over the weekend to admire the painting, with one family traveling from the northern city of Hamburg especially for the occasion, museum spokesperson Susanne Hirschmann told German news agency dpa on Wednesday. The museum could not immediately be reached.",
      "The Swifties\u2019 goal: an Art Nouveau painting by Friedrich Heyser featuring Ophelia, Hamlet\u2019s beloved in William Shakespeare\u2019s play of the same name.",
      "In the original play, Ophelia, a young noblewoman of Denmark, ultimately becomes mad and drowns.",
      "Heyser\u2019s oil-on-canvas painting presents the figure of Ophelia clad in white and surrounded by white water lilies. The painting\u2019s exact year of creation is not known but experts believe it dates back to around 1900.",
      "In the opening scene of the video for the hit song \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia,\u201d Swift slips into the role of Ophelia and becomes a living painting.",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement. At the \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.",
      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

      "Richard Linklater likes to joke that if he and Ethan Hawke didn\u2019t know each other so well, Hawke probably would have punched him during the making of \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d",
      "The two Texans have been friends and collaborators for over 30 years. They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",
      "The script from author Robert Kaplow takes audiences inside the famed Broadway theater district restaurant Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in 1943. Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",
      "For over 20 years Rodgers and Hart were a prolific and successful songwriting team, behind musical hits and hundreds of classic songs, including \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d \u201cThe Lady is a Tramp\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d It\u2019s one of the great artistic partnerships of all time.

      "\u201cThe country is changing, and the jazz era is ending and a new era is beginning and one of these people is going to continue on to lead and the other is going to be completely left behind,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s so funny in the face of tragedy? That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",
      "Making a life in the arts requires immense sacrifice no matter how you look at it. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the culture will pass you by. Hawke, for one, said he\u2019s had three distinct moments in his career where he was pretty sure he was washed up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",
      "The experience made him think of a lot of the people he came up with, who mentored him when he was starting out in the theater in the 1980s. Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to art careers,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI think we all think we\u2019re just going to run the table and do this until the day we die. But things get in the way.\u201d",
      "One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about (yet) is a creative breakup between Linklater and Hawke. Linklater might have given his friend some tough love, but they never argued, and in the end it was worth it. Hawke lived up to the challenge and no one got punched.",

      "Gov. Gavin Newsom says California will begin selling affordable insulin under its own label on Jan. 1, nearly three years after he first announced a partnership to sell state-branded generic drugs at lower prices",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that California will begin selling affordable insulin under its own label on Jan. 1, nearly three years after he first announced a partnership to sell state-branded generic drugs at lower prices.",
      "But California won\u2019t be the only state making lower-cost insulin available. The nonprofit Civica said it will also distribute its economical diabetes medication to pharmacies nationwide.",
      "Starting in the new year, insulin pens will be available in California under the CalRx label for $11 per pen, or a maximum of $55 for a five-pack, Civica said.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need a new prescription You just simply transition to this bio-similar insulin that now is being provided,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference in Los Angeles. \u201cIt's access on the basis of affordability.\u201d",
      "The state entered a 10-year deal with Civica and Biocon Biologics in early 2023. Officials said then that they hoped California\u2019s emergence as an insulin-maker would prompt prices to collapse. Research has shown that costs for the drug have more than tripled in the past couple of decades.",
      "The new pens will be interchangeable with glargine, the generic alternative for more expensive once-a-day injections that regulates blood sugar. As a comparison, the equivalent of a five-pack of Eli Lilly's Rezvoglar sells to pharmacies for more than $88, according to data compiled by the governor\u2019s office, but consumers may pay a different price based on their insurance.",
      "About 38 million Americans \u2014 and roughly 3.5 million Californians \u2014 have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.",

      "Chris Noble, organizing director of Health Access California, a statewide consumer health care advocacy group, welcomed Newsom\u2019s announcement, saying efforts by California and others to develop a competing generic will bring relief to patients who have seen drug prices spike in recent years.",
      "\u201cCalifornia consumers need relief now, so health advocates are relieved to see CalRx moving quickly to lower insulin costs for the people of California while continuing to pursue other needed prescription drug cost solutions,\" Noble said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe hope to see additional fast acting insulins included in CalRxs portfolio so insulin dependent patients have all of their insulin needs met.\u201d",

      "State lawmakers approved $100 million for the project in 2022, with $50 million dedicated to developing three types of insulin and the rest set aside to invest in a manufacturing facility.",
      "According to state documents from 2023, the proposed program could save many patients between $2,000 and $4,000 a year. In addition, lower costs could result in substantial savings because the state buys the product every year for the millions of people on its publicly funded health plans.",
      "The state also is exploring the possibility of bringing other drugs to market. Newsom announced in April that the state will sell the overdose medication Naloxone. The drug, available as a nasal spray and in an injectable form, is considered a key tool in the battle against a nationwide overdose crisis.",

      "The protest descended into clashes with police who attempted to disperse protesters trying to reach the plant in an industrial complex, which is a designated military zone. Gabes, home to more than 400,000 residents, lies at the heart of Tunisia\u2019s phosphate industry, one of the key sources of export revenue for the North African country.",
      "Wednesday's protests were the latest since a gas leak near the state-owned Chemical Group of Tunisia industrial complex. The leak sent dozens of residents, including children, to hospitals in recent weeks, according to environmental activist group \u201cStop Pollution.\u201d",
      "The leak reignited long-standing anger in the coastal city, where residents blame more than five decades of industrial activity for rising cancer rates, respiratory illnesses and the collapse of the region\u2019s once-thriving and unique ecosystem.",
      "By nightfall Wednesday, plumes of tear gas, burning tires and trash bins filled the streets as protesters blocked major roads and chanted against what they called \u201cenvironmental crimes.\u201d Many demanded the dissolution of the GCT and closure of its phosphate units, which they accused of slowly poisoning Gabes.",
      "The city\u2019s chemical complex processes raw phosphate into fertilizer, an operation that for decades has discharged toxic waste directly into the Gulf of Gabes. Environmental groups say the pollution has wiped out marine life, turned the waters dark and forced generations of fishermen out of work.",
      "Successive Tunisian governments have promised to relocate or modernize the plant, but environmental activists say those pledges have repeatedly gone unfulfilled.",
      "Tunisia\u2019s National Observatory for Agriculture has repeatedly warned air quality in parts of Gabes exceeds limits set by the World Health Organization. Environmental experts repeatedly noted the persistent high levels of sulfur dioxide and ammonia in the atmosphere, pollutants known to cause respiratory damage and contribute to acid rain.",

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",
      "Today, 62-year-old Mosoeunyane leads a peer support group in her village, Ha Koloboi. Neighbors ask for advice and trust her with their green medical booklets, where they record medical history, viral load, symptoms and medications.",
      "Lately, the group mostly worries \u2014 about the future, losing medication access, getting sick again.",
      "\u201cThis has been the most difficult time for me,\u201d Mosoeunyane said.",
      "Many in Mosoeunyane\u2019s group wish Trump himself could hear their concerns. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision is already translating into real life,\u201d said Mateboho Talitha Fusi, Mosoeunyane\u2019s friend and neighbor.",
      "The worries span Lesotho society: from rural to urban, low to middle income, patients to officials. Many Basotho \u2013 as people in Lesotho are known \u2013 feel hopeless.",
      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",
      "\u201cStop work immediately,\u201d she was told.",
      "Lechela\u2019s organization, the USAID-funded Phelisanang Bophelong HIV/AIDS network, had drop-in centers at gas stations where sex workers could seek services. Workers set up tents outside bars with condoms and the prevention medication known as PreP. Teams delivered medication directly to patients who wouldn\u2019t step foot in public health clinics, for fear of discrimination.",
      "Lechela\u2019s group earned the trust of the skeptics and the stubborn. All that work is gone, she fears. She still gets calls from people desperate for services and refills. She does what she can, and their stories haunt her.",
      "Among them is a textile factory worker who turned to sex work at night to support her three children. She used to take PrEP and isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll protect herself. Most clients won\u2019t use condoms, she said, some turning violent if sex workers insist.",
      "\u201cI have to put bread on the table,\u201d said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity because her husband, who works in South Africa, wouldn\u2019t approve of her sex work. She can\u2019t miss a day of factory work to wait in line at a clinic.",
      "Visiting the woman at home, all Lechela could do was demonstrate how to use a female condom \u2013 and hope her clients wouldn\u2019t notice or protest.",
      "With nearly all community groups and local organizations like Lechela\u2019s closed and 1,500 health workers fired, some Lesotho officials see overdue signs that their nation and others must stop relying on international aid.",

She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",

The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",
      "Lesotho funded only 12% of its own health budget. The U.S. and other foreign donors provided the rest. USAID alone accounted for 34% of the budget; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 26%, according to a May presentation to lawmakers.",
      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily. There had been only verbal promises, nothing in writing, he noted, and hundreds of health workers who had been promised they\u2019d be absorbed by the national health system remain unemployed.",
      "Unlike other PEPFAR-supported countries, Lesotho funded medication for 80% of its HIV patients \u2014 a figure officials tout as they try to move toward a self-sustaining system. Still, the aid cuts sparked panic over supply and distribution.",

      "Nurses were told to cut back. Patients grew alarmed.",
      "Miner Monyamane said he got a three-month supply, not his usual 12. So instead of continuing to work in South Africa, he decided to remain in his small village of Thaba-Tsoeu Ha Mafa. Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck. He fears diseases such as tuberculosis \u2014 a leading cause of death in Lesotho, attributed to weakened immune systems \u2014 may creep up on him if he interrupts treatment.",

      "The latest report analyzed data from the CDC's 2024 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which uses annual telephone surveys to collect data on health behaviors and chronic conditions in U.S. states and territories.",
      "It showed that 19 states had obesity rates among adults of 35% or higher, 22 states had rates between 30% and 35% and nine states had obesity rates of below 30%. The rates varied from a low of 25% in Colorado to a high of more than 40% in West Virginia.",
      "Between 2023 and 2024, no state had statistically significant increases or decreases in their obesity rates, after 18 states saw significant increases in the previous five years, the report found.",
      "Before 2013, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%, By 2019, a dozen states had rates that high \u2014 and the number continued to climb.",

      "The report also details a broad range of federal, state and local efforts that focus on improving nutrition and boosting physical activity, said Solveig Cunningham, an Emory University global health expert who specializes in obesity.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",
      "\u201cThis is not the principle of ubuntu,\u201d said Sheila Mbele-Khama, in reference to the South African philosophy that values principles such as human dignity and fairness.",

      "According to Wendy Cupido, country manager for Gilead, the South African manufacturers that were evaluated in 2024 did not satisfy the technical specifications for the production of sterile injectables at that time. She said, though, that Gilead was still willing to look at further voluntary licensing if a South African manufacturer could develop the required capabilities and meet quality standards.",
      "Welcoming the over $34 million in investment into the rollout, UNAIDS South Africa country director Eva Kiwango said at a time when foreign assistance funding cuts could lead to an additional 6 million HIV infections globally by 2029, long-acting injectable medicines were a \u201cfresh option for all people at risk,\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt is not a cure or a vaccine, but it could be a game changer if made accessible to all who could benefit,\u201d said Kiwango. \u201cFor many, lenacapavir expands choice, strengthens agency, and reduces barriers linked to stigma, disclosure, or daily adherence.\u201d",
      "The roundtable is a two-day event that will conclude on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Prince Andrew has been banished from the royal whirl after emails emerged this week showing that he had remained in contact with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he previously admitted",
      "It was one scandal too many.",
      "After emails emerged this week showing that Prince Andrew remained in contact with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he previously admitted, the House of Windsor finally moved to insulate the monarchy from years of tawdry headlines about Andrew's dodgy friends and suspicious business deals.",
      "Buckingham Palace on Friday released a statement from Andrew saying that he had agreed to give up use of his last remaining royal titles so that continued allegations about him \u201cdon\u2019t distract from the work of His Majesty.\u201d",
      "This week\u2019s revelations demonstrated that Andrew had committed the unforgivable sin of misleading the British public, said Craig Prescott, an expert on the monarchy and constitutional law at Royal Holloway University of London.",
      "\u201cTo say something which is proven not to be true, I think, is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "The move comes as Charles, who is 76 and undergoing treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer, works to ensure the long-term stability of the monarchy under his son and heir Prince William.",
      "William recently gave an interview in which he set out his vision for the monarchy, saying that the institution needed to change to make sure that it is a force for good.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, Prince Andrew has been the exact opposite of that,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cAnd there is no space for that in the modern monarchy.\u201d",
      "Andrew, 65, is the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II. He spent more than 20 years as an officer in the Royal Navy before leaving to take up his royal duties in 2001.",
      "Following Friday\u2019s announcement, Andrew will no longer use his remaining royal titles, including the Duke of York, though he technically retains them. Formally stripping him of those titles would be a time-consuming process requiring an act of Parliament.",
      "Andrew\u2019s banishment completes a process that began in November 2019, when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles.",
      "That was triggered by a disastrous interview Andrew gave to the BBC as he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl, Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. The prince was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",
      "The interview also sowed the seeds of this week\u2019s upheaval, when Andrew told the BBC that he had cut off contact with Epstein in December 2010.",
      "British newspapers on Sunday revealed that Andrew wrote an email to Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew wrote the note after renewed reporting on the Epstein scandal, telling him they were \u201cin this together\u201d and would \u201chave to rise above it.\u201d",

      "Andrew has recently faced another round of grimy stories as newspapers release excerpts of Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which will be published on Tuesday. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41.",
      "Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn\u2019t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre\u2019s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.",
      "The prince has been the subject of tabloid stories stretching back to at least 2007, when he sold his house near Windsor Castle for 20% over the 15 million pound asking price. The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then-president of Kazakhstan, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain.",
      "Last year, a court case revealed Andrew\u2019s relationship with a businessman and suspected Chinese spy who was barred from the United Kingdom as a threat to national security. Authorities were concerned that the man could have misused his influence over Andrew, according to court documents.",
      "While the palace said Andrew had decided to give up his royal titles, royal commentator Jennie Bond said the king and Prince William exerted \u201cenormous pressure\u201d on him.",
      "\u201cWe could say he has fallen on his sword, but I think he\u2019s been pushed onto it,\u201d Bond told the BBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a decision that Andrew, quite an arrogant man \u2014 very, very fond of his status \u2014 would have willingly made without a lot of pressure.\u201d",
      "While the cumulative weight of Andrew\u2019s scandals demanded a response from the royal family, this week\u2019s revelations came at a particularly sensitive moment for the king as he prepares for a state visit to the Vatican, where he is expected to pray beside Pope Leo XIV.",
      "The visit is very important to Charles, who has made the bridging of faiths an important part of his \u201cmantra,\u201d said George Gross, an expert on theology and the monarchy at King\u2019s College, London.",
      "\u201cI think this was the speediest, really the quickest way of lowering his status even more without having to go to Parliament,\u201d Gross said. \u201cEven if Parliament would have approved, it takes time.\u2019\u2019",
      "Charles may also have been motivated by a desire to protect the work of Queen Camilla, who has made combating domestic violence one of her signature issues, and the Duchess of Edinburgh, who has sought to combat sexual violence in war zones such as Congo.",
      "The king will hope that this move finally draws a line between Andrew and the rest of the royal family, Prescott said.",
      "\u201cIf there are allegations, or further stuff comes out, it will all be on Prince Andrew,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve severed the connection between Prince Andrew and the monarchy as an institution.\u201d",

      "Protests have erupted in Morocco, driven by young people demanding change",
      "RABAT, Morocco (AP) \u2014 Demonstrations in more than a dozen cities have jolted Morocco for weeks, with the young people behind them showing they can translate digital discontent into a real-world movement that authorities can\u2019t ignore.",
      "The North African nation is the latest to be rocked by \u201cGen Z\u201d protests against corruption, lack of opportunity and business as usual. New protests are expected Saturday.",
      "Similar movements have risen in countries such as Madagascar, Kenya, Peru and Nepal. They differ in origin but share a common refusal to go through institutions like political parties or unions to be heard.",
      "In Morocco, anger has boiled over contrasts between government spending on stadiums in the lead-up to the 2030 FIFA World Cup and a subpar health system that lags behind countries with similarly sized economies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "A leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 is the engine behind the protests. Members debate strategy on Discord, a chat app popular with gamers and teens. The core group has about 180,000 members, but spinoffs have also sprouted, organizing demonstrations in towns independently.",
      "Like other nations swept by Gen Z protests, Morocco is experiencing a youth bulge, with more than half of the population under 35. Yet, as the country pours billions into infrastructure and tourism, unemployment for Moroccans ages 15-24 has climbed to 36%. And with opportunity lacking, more than half of Moroccans under 35 say they have considered emigrating, according to a June survey from non-partisan research network Afrobarometer.",
      "When demonstrations turned violent earlier this month, officials said most participants were minors and rights groups said many detained were under 18.",
      "Morocco is Africa\u2019s most visited country, appealing to tourists from around the world with its medieval palaces, bustling markets and sweeping mountain and desert landscapes. But not far from tourist routes, the daily reality for most of Morocco\u2019s 37 million people includes soaring costs of living and stagnating wages.",
      "The North African Kingdom has made significant strides in lifting standards of living, but development has been uneven and critics say it has exacerbated inequities.",
      "Morocco boasts Africa\u2019s only high-speed rail line and is constructing seven new stadiums and renovating seven others in preparation for the World Cup. It plans to spend more than $5 billion on infrastructure for the event, some from the private sector. Yet with a monthly minimum wage of around $300, many languish in poverty in areas where roads are unpaved, hospitals lack doctors and classrooms are underfunded and overcrowded.",
      "Morocco has only 7.7 medical professionals per 10,000 inhabitants and far fewer in parts of the south and east where protests have become most heated. The public health system provides more than 80% of care, but accounts for only 40% of spending, with the rest coming from private or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "Before Gen Z 212, localized protests against regional inequities and government priorities erupted, including in Al Haouz, where many remain in tents more than two years after a deadly 2023 earthquake. Anger boiled in September after eight women died giving birth in a public hospital in the coastal city of Agadir. Despite its renovated airport and reputation as a destination for tourists, the city is the capital of one of Morocco\u2019s poorest provinces where residents have decried a lack of doctors and quality medical care.",
      "Protesters, angry over corruption, have likened the government to a mafia and targeted Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and Health Minister Amine Tahraoui, his former business associate. Akhannouch, one of Morocco\u2019s richest men, controls most of the country\u2019s gas stations, and one of his companies recently won controversial government contracts for new desalination projects.",

At the time, he acknowledged development had not adequately trickled down to benefit all.",
      "Though the king is the country\u2019s highest authority, Gen Z protesters directed their ire at government officials and called on him to oversee reforms. Many on the streets shouted: \u201cThe people want the King to intervene.\"",
      "In an address to Parliament this month, the king defended Morocco\u2019s vision for the future, arguing that large-scale projects and social programs can advance together. He mirrored some of the protesters\u2019 grievances but didn\u2019t address the movement directly.",
      "\u201cSocial justice is not a temporary priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be no contradiction or competition between major national projects and social programs, as both share the same goal: developing the country and improving the living conditions of citizens wherever they may be.\"",

      "In the town of Metepec, southwest of Mexico City, artisans create clay figures that are intertwined with their faith",
      "METEPEC, Mexico (AP) \u2014 The first time he met a pope, Mexican craftsman Hilario Hern\u00e1ndez could not believe his luck. He did not travel to the Vatican as a guest, but as the guardian of the fragile ceramic piece he had created as a gift for Benedict XVI.",
      "\u201cNo one really planned to take me along,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cBut a Tree of Life can easily break, so I got the chance to bring it myself.\u201d",
      "The work he was commissioned to create for the pope in 2008 is a celebrated expression of Mexican craftsmanship.",
      "Known as a Tree of Life, it belongs to a tradition that flourished in the hands of artisans in the mid-20th century and is considered a symbol of identity in Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s hometown.",
      "In Metepec, where he lives and runs a family workshop about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Mexico City, dozens of craftsmen devote themselves to creating Trees of Life. Their designs vary, but most share a common motif: the biblical scene of Genesis, with Adam and Eve at the center, separated by the tree\u2019s trunk and a coiled snake.",
      "\u201cThe tree allows you to express whatever you want,\u201d said Carolina Ram\u00edrez, a guide at Metepec\u2019s Clay Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s a source of pride for us, as it has become part of the town\u2019s identity and charm.\u201d",
      "The museum holds an annual contest that encourages artisans from across Mexico to submit their versions of the tree. It now houses more than 300 pieces and displays a permanent selection of them.",
      "Aside from Adam and Eve, the trees display a variety of figures like Catrinas \u2014 skeletal female figures that have become a symbol of Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead celebrations \u2014 and Xoloitzcuintles, hairless dogs sacred to ancient Nahua people.",
      "\u201cA tree\u2019s theme draws from our culture and traditions,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cAnd for the people who buy them, they\u2019ve become a source of identity.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s ancestors have crafted clay pieces for as long as he can remember. His grandfather, now 103, still creates pots in Metepec.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the fifth generation of potters and artisans,\u201d said Felipe, one of Hilario\u2019s younger brothers. \u201cOur knowledge is passed down by word-of-mouth.\u201d",
      "All five siblings trained for technical careers. None went on to practice them, choosing to become full-time artisans instead.",
      "Hilario \u2014 the eldest \u2014 became his brothers\u2019 mentor. Their tasks now rotate among them. While one shapes leaves for the trees, another attaches them or paints. All take pride in their family\u2019s legacy.",
      "Luis, now 34, said he has crafted Trees of Life since age 12. \u201cThis workshop was my playground,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhat I initially thought of as a game, later became my job.\u201d",
      "Another local artisan, Cecilio S\u00e1nchez, also inherited his father\u2019s skills and went on to found his own workshop. Now his wife, two children and other relatives work together to create a tradition of their own.",
      "His technique is known as pigmented clay and consists of mixing clay with oxides. \u201cSome fellow artisans add industrial pigments to their pieces, but our work is about preserving what the earth itself gives us,\u201d he said.",

      "Drawing on his father\u2019s ancestral wisdom, he fired the 2-meter-tall (6.6-foot-tall) clay piece at just the right temperature. To transport it, he wrapped it like a giant mummy using 200 rolls of toilet paper to cushion and seal every hollow space.",
      "Then there was the design. For six months, he and his family patiently crafted figures on both sides \u2014 a challenge rarely faced in the business. One face told the story of Mexico\u2019s most revered saints; the other, the origins of Metepec\u2019s Tree of Life.",
      "The details of that history are unclear. Yet experts agree that such trees might have played a role in evangelization after the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century.",
      "According to Ram\u00edrez, the first artisans to reinterpret them in modern times incorporated elements distinctive to Metepec. One of them is known as the Tlanchana, a half-woman, half-serpent figure who, legend has it, once ruled the waters around the town.",
      "\u201cIt was thought that her coming out of the water brought abundance,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cFor our ancestors, deities were bound to fire, water and nature.\u201d",
      "The Tlanchana figures in Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Trees of Life, though, no longer resemble snakes. Given that the reptile is regarded as a representation of evil, temptation and death within the Catholic worldview, its tail was replaced. In her current form as a mermaid, she is perhaps Metepec\u2019s most iconic symbol alongside the Tree of Life.",
      "Hilario keeps a special frame on his worktable: a photograph of the day he met a pope for the second time.",
      "On that occasion he didn\u2019t travel to the Vatican. In 2015, a stranger knocked on his door and asked him to create another Tree of Life \u2014 this time, for another pope. Francis was soon to visit Mexico and the president wanted the artisan to present him with a masterpiece.",
      "Hilario\u2019s new assignment took three months of hard, family work. Francis\u2019 tree would not be as tall as the one made for Benedict. But the design presented challenges of its own, as it was to portray the pope\u2019s life.",
      "The craftsman visited nearby chapels, spoke to priests and read as much as he could. In February 2016, when he met the pope inside Mexico\u2019s Presidential Palace, he realized he still had much to learn.",
      "\u201cHe ended up explaining to me his own tree,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he added: \u2018I know you didn\u2019t do this on your own, so God bless your family and your hands.\u2019\u201d",
      "The meeting had a life-changing effect on him. It made him reflect on his purpose in life and reaffirmed his calling to his craft.",
      "\u201cMaking Trees of Life is a commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we make a living, but it\u2019s also how we keep our culture alive.\u201d",

      "Torrential rains in east-central Mexico last week have left at least 72 dead and raised concerns about the government's ability to alert people to severe weather",
      "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The most recent torrential rains in east-central Mexico, which have left at least 72 dead and dozens more missing, have raised questions again about the government\u2019s ability to alert people to severe weather in time.",
      "Authorities continue to describe the days of torrential rain last week that set off landslides and river flooding as unpredictable. Residents talk about never having seen anything like it. But researchers say what was considered normal before no longer exists because climate change has accelerated these events and made them more frequent. And that requires preparation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re being more and more affected by these phenomena and we can\u2019t go on like this, failing by not knowing what to do and not having \u2026 adequate warning,\u201d said Christian Dom\u00ednguez, a researcher at the Atmosphere and Climate Change Institute at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University. She recalled that last year\u2019s crises were drought-related and this year, it\u2019s the rain.",
      "It is a pending issue for Mexico and for countries with more resources and advanced technology like the United States, which experienced a devastating flash flood in Texas this year that killed at least 136 people. Experts say society and governments appear to be stuck in the past and have not accepted that severe weather is now the norm.",
      "In Mexico\u2019s case, it\u2019s president for the past year, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a trained scientist with a background in climate change. But while she expressed willingness this week to review prevention protocols, she didn\u2019t mention climate change and insisted it was impossible to predict with precision how much rain was going to fall in some places.",
      "\u201cThe language being used has to be considered\u201d in how to communicate the dangers in an event, Carlos Vald\u00e9s, former head of Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center. \u201cThe first thing we have to do is recognize that there is a change \u2026 the atypical is now the most typical.\u201d",
      "There are technological gaps. For example, Dom\u00ednguez recognized that Mexico does not have all of the instrumentation for things like measuring river levels in real time that could provide detailed hydrological forecasts or enough weather radars to allow meteorologists to make better forecasts.",
      "But she emphasized that even with the existing forecasts there could be much better prevention strategies if officials think not only of preparing for hurricanes, but also the possibility that the confluence of various weather systems, as occurred last week, has the potential to create a dangerous situation.",
      "In the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, the day before the main rivers in the northern part of the state jumped their banks, torrential rain was forecast to dump nearly 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain.",
      "It ended up being three times that, but the original forecast should have been enough for residents and authorities to get organized, Dom\u00ednguez said.",
      "But in Poza Rica, the hardest-hit city, residents started to flee their homes when the water was already flooding them. Some said authorities warned them too late. Most didn\u2019t think it was going to be so bad.",

      "Experts say that not only do civil defense officials require training, but people need to be educated too.",
      "Over decades, Mexico has developed new ways to alert of seismic activity in central and southern Mexico. With memories of Otis still fresh, Sheinbaum said her administration would focus more on prevention involving hurricanes and rains.",
      "On Friday, thousands of soldiers and officials worked to reopen roads cut by landslides and washed out bridges in Veracruz. But just to the north in neighboring Tamaulipas state, officials watching the Panuco River had already issued clearer warnings Thursday about the chance of flooding when it had risen almost a foot (30 cm).",

      "The closed-door gathering \u2014 known as the fourth plenum \u2014 is expected to last four days and will discuss and put the final touches on China\u2019s next five-year plan, a blueprint for 2026-2030.",
      "The leaders are meeting at a time of heightened trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and just ahead of a possible meeting between Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump during a regional summit later this month.",
      "Here is what to know about the meeting:",
      "The fourth plenum refers to the fourth plenary session, out of typically a total of seven sessions during the five-year term of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s central committee. Xi and about 370 members of the central committee are expected to attend.",

China faces challenges from the trade war that has intensified since Trump took office, but also from chronic domestic problems that are dragging on growth.",
      "Longstanding efforts to boost consumer spending and investment by businesses and to curb excess capacity in many industries top the list of economic priorities. But Xi also will likely highlight China's push to become the global leader in many technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "China\u2019s pursuit of technological \u201cself-sufficiency,\u201d weaning its industries of their reliance on advanced computer chips from the U.S., has sped up as Trump tightens American export control measures and raises tariffs.

The government has adopted incremental policy moves \u2014 such as increased government subsidies for childcare, consumer loans, and trade-in programs for appliances and electric vehicles.",

      "Since the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has struggled to reignite faster economic growth. Its property sector downturn has complicated that effort, causing massive layoffs and leading families to cut back on spending as house prices have fallen.",
      "Wendy Leutert, a professor of economics and trade at Indiana University, noted in a recent report that China is still stinting on spending on areas that might help to balance the economy and encourage more consumer spending, such as health care, education and child and elder care.",
      "\u201cOverall, China\u2019s leaders still appear willing to accept economic costs, including resource misallocation and failures, in order to pursue self-sufficiency and technological leadership in strategically important industries and strengthen overall national power,\u201d she wrote.",

      "Bonta announced Friday the state reached settlements with four other companies California alleged violated the 2014 law: Revolution Sustainable Solutions, Metro Poly, PreZero US Packaging and Advance Polybag. The businesses agreed to collectively pay the state nearly $1.8 million and halt plastic bag sales in California after selling the rest of their existing stock.",

      "Sounds hard to believe, but a young Victoria Beckham was put in the back row at theater school for being too heavy",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Now here\u2019s something you might not quite believe about Victoria Beckham, glam Spice Girl turned high-profile fashion designer: At theater school, they purposely put her in the back row. Because she was too heavy.",
      "\u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d she says now of the memory from her youth, sipping a sparkling water in a Manhattan hotel in between work engagements. \u201cWe were all judged on how we looked. I was young. I had bad skin, my weight was going up and down, I had really lank hair.\u201d",
      "Beckham was also bullied in school and told she was a bad learner, revelations that come in a new documentary, \u201cVictoria Beckham.\u201d The three-part Netflix series traces her career and especially her ascension in the fashion world \u2014 building up to a grand Paris runway show at a palace in front of 600 people.",
      "That 2024 show \u2014 with a rainstorm threatening to scuttle the whole thing \u2014 is presented as a career pinnacle for a designer who spent years proving herself alongside giants of the field, showing she wasn\u2019t simply a celebrity slapping her name on a label. ( Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour is among the fashion luminaries attesting to Beckham\u2019s hard-won industry acceptance in the documentary).",
      "Of course the show also features liberal doses of Beckham\u2019s soccer legend husband David \u2014 just as Victoria appeared in his own recent, popular Netflix documentary \u201cBeckham\u201d (both were produced by David Beckham\u2019s own Studio 99).",
      "Some reviews have said Victoria\u2019s documentary feels more guarded and less revelatory. In any case, Victoria Beckham says wanted to tell her own story, her own way. She focuses only briefly on what a certain generation knows her best for \u2014 the four years she spent as Posh Spice \u2014 and mostly on the two decades she\u2019s been building her eponymous fashion and beauty brand.",
      "Other revelations: While she was the richer partner when they married in 1999 and in fact bought their first house, it was David Beckham who later invested in her label and helped get it going.",
      "She also talks about how her company almost fell apart due to bad business decisions \u2014 like spending 70,000 pounds (about $94,000) on office plants and 15,000 (about $20,000) more to water them \u2014 and how she learned, with investors, to right the ship.",
      "Beckham, 51, sat down with The Associated Press this week during a visit to New York. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "BECKHAM: Well, his documentary wasn\u2019t about me, you know. I was in the documentary as David\u2019s wife and I\u2019ve been part of his journey and I was so honored to talk about that. People\u2019s response to me in that really surprised me, and there was something quite liberating about that because when I saw myself ... I didn\u2019t like how I came across. But then I think I\u2019ve always felt that way about myself. I suppose it gave me the confidence to do my own.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019ve been in the fashion industry for almost two decades. I was in the Spice Girls for four years \u2014 and have been so defined by that four-year period in my life. A time that I\u2019m so proud of, but I\u2019ve fighting preconceptions because of that period. I feel that only now is my brand in a place where me talking about my past will not affect the brand that I\u2019ve built.",

And by the way, that started when I was a child, when I was at school. If anybody watches this documentary and I can give them the confidence to follow their dreams, that\u2019s another really good reason to do it.",
      "BECKHAM: Oh absolutely, I think that for many years I was misunderstood, before social media, you know, the media told the narrative, and then there were paparazzi pictures where most of the time I looked incredibly unhappy. And I think looking at the documentary telling my story from ME explains the why. I can\u2019t blame people for looking at the pictures of me looking really grumpy.",
      "BECKHAM: Never quite like this. The opportunity has never really presented itself. And I know a lot of people can relate to my story because of all the messages that I\u2019ve had since people have watched the documentary. ... From, yes, people that I know, but people that I don\u2019t know, people who say, \u201cI can relate, I have been through that.\u201d It\u2019s taken this process finally for me to feel at my age proud of what I\u2019ve achieved and also to finally believe that I am enough.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019m so respectful of my time with Spice Girls. I still see all of the girls now. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am now ... the Spice Girls gave me the confidence to be me. I remember Geri (Halliwell) saying to me, \u201cYou\u2019re funny, be funny.\u201d I\u2019m shy. And they really gave me my personality back. ... I think people would be surprised to know that I was only a Spice Girl for four years. I\u2019ve been in fashion nearly two decades, but people like to pigeonhole.",
      "BECKHAM: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. \u2026 I think I\u2019ve earned my place to be showing where I am. I think that I\u2019ve more than proved myself and earned the right to be there. Now I have to work hard to maintain that.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019ve learned so much. I know what I know and I really know what I DON'T know. It got to a stage where my investors told me that we had to re-strategize not just the business side of things but the creative things as well. And that was difficult. ... We had to change a lot of things to fix the business and I took it on the chin. Of course that meant compromising, but I wanted to save the business.",
      "BECKHAM: Fashion in its own right is profitable. And to be able to say that in this current climate is something I\u2019m very proud of. I\u2019m an independent brand as well, so I\u2019m incredibly proud to say the fashion is making money. Beauty is also doing incredibly well. And now, it is about building the house that I really have always dreamed of.",
      "BECKHAM: I recognize that I am really blessed. I am very appreciative of the life I have. You have to take it along with the other stuff.",

      "The drastic austerity program of Argentina\u2019s libertarian President Javier Milei has succeeded in lowering inflation and won effusive praise from President Donald Trump",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 The factory floor used to roar.",
      "Walking around his textile mill in southern Buenos Aires, Luciano Galfione pointed out the up-to-the-minute machines that once whirred and clattered as 200 employees churned out fabric to be transformed into athleisure and other apparel for Argentina\u2019s vast middle class.",
      "But on Monday afternoon, the factory was so quiet that Galfione's footsteps rang clear through the compound. A handful of workers at the Galfione Group factory in Argentina\u2019s capital spooled yarn and dyed cloth.",
      "Almost two years after libertarian President Javier Milei stormed to power on a promise to rescue Argentina\u2019s crisis-stricken economy through harsh austerity and free-market reforms, falling orders and surging competition have forced Galfione to cut operations by 80%, lay off or suspend half his staff and use his own savings to keep his family's 78-year-old firm afloat.",
      "Other companies have simply closed their doors. Over 17,600 businesses \u2014 among them 1,800 manufacturers and 380 textile companies \u2014 have folded in the last year and a half, according to Fundaci\u00f3n Pro Tejer, a nonprofit representing textile manufacturers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an industry in crisis, and it\u2019s about to go bankrupt,\u201d said Galfione, who also runs Fundaci\u00f3n Pro Tejer. \u201cNot only textiles. Textiles are just the first and fastest to fall.\"",
      "As Argentina heads to Oct. 26 midterm elections widely seen as a referendum on Milei\u2019s policies, Galfione\u2019s troubles reflect bigger shocks jolting the country. The economy has sputtered. Cheap imports have gutted manufacturing. Spending has stumbled, squeezed by higher unemployment and lower wages.",
      "The turmoil engulfing Argentine financial markets began when voters in the manufacturing belt of suburban Buenos Aires \u2014 a region that for decades represented the dream of national industry nurtured by tariff protection \u2014 punished Milei in a provincial election last month.",
      "The scale of Milei's humiliation triggered a sharp peso sell-off and sent officials scrambling to secure $20 billion in financing from a friendly Trump administration.",
      "President Donald Trump, who sees a kindred spirit and fellow culture warrior in Argentina's chain saw wielding leader, shocked Argentines and Americans alike Tuesday by warning that the $20 billion was contingent on Milei's success in what is shaping up to be a hotly contested legislative election.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went further on Wednesday, saying that the U.S. could tap investment funds to provide Argentina with up to $40 billion.",
      "\u201cJust helping a great philosophy take over a great country,\u201d Trump explained after meeting Milei at the White House.",
      "Thousands of miles away, many Argentines are losing patience with that philosophy.",
      "Those interviewed on the streets of Buenos Aires Wednesday had no illusions about Trump's lifeline fixing their problems.",
      "\u201cLet's say they give us this money from abroad. What am I going to do with it?\u201d asked Walter Willatt, a 56-year-old newsstand owner whose son was just laid off from a local Toyota dealership. \u201cIf the economy revives it will have to be through domestic consumption.\u201d",
      "Over a year ago, markets cheered as Milei fulfilled his flagship promise to reduce the runway inflation that he inherited from his populist predecessors. Many Argentines \u2014 who had grown accustomed to supermarkets revising prices upward everyday \u2014 hailed Milei's program as a miraculous outbreak of normalcy in a notoriously topsy-turvy economy.",
      "But today, price stability is old news as Argentines contend with a lengthening list of worries.",
      "Unemployment in Buenos Aires Province climbed to 9.8% in the second quarter of this year, compared to 7.3% during the same period in 2023, before Milei entered office. Salaries nationwide haven't kept up with inflation. Milei's major subsidy cuts mean that even if prices have stabilized, Argentines are paying more for bus fares, utility bills and healthcare.",

Garc\u00eda, Director for the Americas for the Horizon Engage political risk consultancy firm. \u201cThere's a new generation of demands. The economy needs to grow, there needs to be job creation. I\u2019m not sure that government is prepared to meet those demands.\"",
      "Rodolfo N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a 43-year-old former factory worker in Pilar, outside Buenos Aires, said he voted for Milei in 2023 because he wanted change. Then the blows began to fall. His daughter's epilepsy medication shot up in price. His retired parents struggled to afford groceries on their $300-a-month pension.",
      "On Aug. 29, the ceramic factory where he worked for the last 18 years shut down. The company, ILVA, fired all the plant's 300 workers in a WhatsApp message that cited the economic crisis, leaving N\u00fa\u00f1ez and his colleagues in limbo, without severance pay or health insurance.",
      "ILVA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhat Milei promised, he didn\u2019t do. He messed with retirees, he messed with my daughter and he messed with the workers,\u201d he said from outside the padlocked ILVA factory where dozens of dismissed employees now camp out in protest, the air filled with smoke from burning tires and roasting chicken.",

      "Other policies that Milei depends on to fight inflation \u2014 such as high interest rates and central bank interventions to defend the peso \u2014 further erode the competitiveness of Argentine industry.",
      "The peso has become so strong that shoppers now get more bang for their buck by splurging anywhere but Argentina \u2014 from Chile\u2019s malls to Brazil\u2019s beaches.",
      "Upon taking office, Milei tore down trade barriers and relaxed import restrictions, opening Argentina to an avalanche of cheaper industrial and textile products. Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein pay no import duties for products valued below $400.",
      "But Milei maintained sky-high taxes for Argentine manufacturers, giving local companies no choice but to pass on the cost to consumers.",
      "\u201cThis is not a fair playing field,\u201d said Pablo Yeramian, director of the Argentine textile company Norfabril, who has already cut 20% of his staff.",
      "As scenes of Milei beaming beside Trump in Washington flashed across Argentine televisions on Tuesday, some manufacturers couldn't help wishing that the similarity between the two presidents was, in at least one way, more than just rhetorical.",
      "\u201cNo developed country in the world surrenders its industrial sovereignty,\u201d said Galfione, pointing to Trump's \u201cMade in America\u201d ambitions for the U.S. \u201cI think instead of doing what the U.S. tells us, we should do what they do.\u201d",

      "The country\u2019s largest teachers unions are teaming up with tech companies like Microsoft and OpenAI to help educators build literacy in artificial intelligence",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

      "In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that \u201cclimate change is currently beyond the scope\" of the state's regulatory review.",
      "But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.",
      "Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility's impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods \u2014 which she noted was the \u201cdefining characteristic\u201d of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, \u201cnone of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.\"",
      "Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.",
      "\u201cThe fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,\u201d LeJuine said. \"These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We\u2019re getting extinct.\u201d",
      "In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.",
      "Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is \u201ccommitted to conservation\" and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.",

      "Investors looked past a 22% drop in CSX\u2019s third quarter earnings Thursday and focused on the direction the railroad\u2019s new CEO might take it and the possibility of any strategic deals.",
      "CEO Steve Angel promised to focus on making CSX the best-performing railroad. Without promising a merger, Angel said he would consider any strategic opportunities that make sense for shareholders. He also reminded investors that he ran industrial gas supplier Praxair for a decade before the opportunity to merge with rival Linde came up.",
      "\u201cThe way these things work \u2014 these strategic opportunities \u2014 you\u2019ve got to wait for the right timing. You\u2019ve got to wait for when the conditions are right,\u201d Angel said. \u201cSo what you do in the interim, you run the company to the best of your ability every day, and you create value that way. And so if and when that time comes, you\u2019re going into that discussion from a position of strength.\u201d",
      "Thursday\u2019s report was the first since Angel took the job late last month. The railroad is under pressure from investors, such as Ancora Holdings, to find another railroad to merge with, so CSX can better compete with the merged Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern railroad if that $85 billion deal gets approved. But both of CSX\u2019s likely merger partners \u2014 BNSF and CPKC railroads \u2014 have said they aren\u2019t interested in a deal because they believe the industry can better serve customers through cooperative agreements and avoid all the potential headaches that come with a merger.",
      "Most observers believe CSX and BNSF will be at a disadvantage if the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger is approved. That transcontinental railroad will be able to shave more than a day off delivery times because it won\u2019t have to hand off shipments between railroads in the middle of the country. So far, CSX and BNSF say they can achieve most of the benefits of a merger through cooperative agreements instead.",
      "Angel, 70, has not worked at a railroad before although earlier in his career he worked at GE\u2019s locomotive building unit and developed a lifelong appreciation for railroads. He stressed the similarities between industrial gas companies and railroads, saying both focus on safety and invest heavily in the most profitable areas with the highest traffic.",

      "While some premium tax credits will remain, the level of support will decrease for most enrollees. Anyone earning more than 400% of the poverty level \u2014 or around $63,000 per year for a single person \u2014 won\u2019t be eligible for the remaining tax credits.",
      "As a result, especially hard-hit groups will include a small number of higher earners who'll have to pay a lot more without the extra subsidies and a large number of lower earners who'll have to pay a small amount more, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.",
      "With higher premiums, some people will drop out of health insurance altogether, Cox said. When many younger, healthier people inevitably forgo coverage, insurance companies will increase costs for members of the covered population to account for them being older and sicker.",
      "The change may also strain hospitals, since more uninsured people will need emergency care they can\u2019t afford. That could lead to hospital closures or cost increases.",
      "\u201cIf you have less subsidies for people getting health insurance, you\u2019re going to have less health coverage and less health care,\u201d said Jason Levitis, a senior fellow in the health policy division at the Urban Institute. \u201cPeople are going to be sicker and die more.\u201d",
      "Erin Jackson-Hill has allergies, asthma and searing hip pain she\u2019s managing with prescribed medications until she can get a hip replacement. But even with all those conditions, the 56-year-old in Anchorage, Alaska, doesn\u2019t think she can pay for health insurance next year if the ACA subsidies aren\u2019t extended.",
      "The executive director of two nonprofits, who also cares for her 89-year-old father full time, already pays nearly $500 a month for her premiums. If the subsidies disappear, she plans to forgo health insurance and pay for her asthma and allergy medications out of pocket.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",
      "Colleges are belatedly realizing how important that kind of data is to students and their families, said Lee Roberts, chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill, in an interview.",
      "\u201cIn uncertain times, students are even more focused \u2014 I would say rightly so \u2014 on what their job prospects are going to be,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think colleges and universities really owe students and their families this data.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has welcomed nearly 130 donors, allies and representatives of major companies for a dinner at the White House to reward them for their contributions to a new $250 million ballroom project",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies for a dinner at the White House to reward them for their pledged contributions to a massive new ballroom.",
      "The ballroom, whose price tag is now estimated at $250 million, is the most significant renovation that Trump, a former real estate mogul, is undertaking during his second term at the White House.",
      "All four sides of the ballroom \u2014 which Trump said will be large and grand enough to hold even a presidential inauguration -- will be made of bulletproof glass, with its color, window shape and molding keeping in character with the White House. Trump indicated that the fundraising and managing costs for the \u201cphenomenal\u201d ballroom were going well, predicting that he would have money left over after the project is done.",
      "\u201cTo me, there\u2019s nothing like the White House,\u201d Trump said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just a special place so we have to take care of it.\u201d",
      "Men in business suits and women in cocktail attire sat at a dozen round tables, decorated with tall, tapered candles and white floral arrangements, and sipped wine and water as they awaited their dinner to be served on gold-trimmed plates. Later, they would dine on an heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef Wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice cream.",
      "Among the companies that had representatives at the dinner, according to a White House official, were Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms and T-Mobile. The Adelson Family Foundation, founded by GOP megadonors Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, also had a presence there.",
      "Oil billionaire Harold Hamm, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, and crypto entrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss were all on the guest list. The list of attendees was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Also attending the dinner were Chris LaCivita, Trump's co-campaign manager from his 2024 reelection bid; Reince Priebus, a White House chief of staff during Trump's first term; and Jason Miller, another longtime political adviser.",
      "The new ballroom is planned for the area where the East Wing is located and will encompass 90,000 square feet. The White House has previously said it will have a 650-person capacity, but Trump on Wednesday night said it will be able to hold up to 999 people.",

      "The ballroom project has yet to receive approvals from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, although White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who was also tapped by Trump to lead the planning commission, says approval is not needed. The commission vets construction of federal buildings.",
      "At the dinner, Trump said there are no zoning requirements for him as the president of the United States and he can do whatever he wants with the construction.",
      "The president has repeatedly complained that large White House events require construction of a tent on the South Lawn, since the East Room \u2013 the current largest space at the White House \u2013 can accommodate only about 200 people.",
      "At the dinner, Trump also formally unveiled another project: an arch that will stand on one end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River and connects Virginia and the District of Columbia. He showed off several miniature models of the proposed arch \u2014 which will feature Lady Liberty on top \u2014 in three sizes, although Trump acknowledged that the largest was his favorite.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really beautiful,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Nurse Rod Salaysay works with all kinds of instruments in the hospital: a thermometer, a stethoscope and sometimes his guitar and ukulele.",
      "In the recovery unit of UC San Diego Health, Salaysay helps patients manage pain after surgery. Along with medications, he offers tunes on request and sometimes sings. His repertoire ranges from folk songs in English and Spanish to Minuet in G Major and movie favorites like \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d",
      "Patients often smile or nod along. Salaysay even sees changes in their vital signs like lower heart rate and blood pressure, and some may request fewer painkillers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s often a cycle of worry, pain, anxiety in a hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can help break that cycle with music.\u201d",
      "Salaysay is a one-man band, but he\u2019s not alone. Over the past two decades, live performances and recorded music have flowed into hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices as research grows on how songs can help ease pain.",
      "The healing power of song may sound intuitive given music\u2019s deep roots in human culture. But the science of whether and how music dulls acute and chronic pain \u2014 technically called music-induced analgesia \u2014 is just catching up.",
      "No one suggests that a catchy song can fully eliminate serious pain. But several recent studies, including in the journals Pain and Scientific Reports, have suggested that listening to music can either reduce the perception of pain or enhance a person\u2019s ability to tolerate it.",
      "What seems to matter most is that patients \u2014 or their families \u2014 choose the music selections themselves and listen intently, not just as background noise.",
      "\u201cPain is a really complex experience,\u201d said Adam Hanley, a psychologist at Florida State University. \u201cIt\u2019s created by a physical sensation, and by our thoughts about that sensation and emotional reaction to it.\u201d",
      "Two people with the same condition or injury may feel vastly different levels of acute or chronic pain. Or the same person might experience pain differently from one day to the next.",
      "Acute pain is felt when pain receptors in a specific part of the body \u2014 like a hand touching a hot stove \u2014 send signals to the brain, which processes the short-term pain. Chronic pain usually involves long-term structural or other changes to the brain, which heighten overall sensitivity to pain signals. Researchers are still investigating how this occurs.",
      "\u201cPain is interpreted and translated by the brain,\" which may ratchet the signal up or down, said Dr. Gilbert Chandler, a specialist in chronic spinal pain at the Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic.",
      "Researchers know music can draw attention away from pain, lessening the sensation. But studies also suggest that listening to preferred music helps dull pain more than listening to podcasts.",
      "\u201cMusic is a distractor. It draws your focus away from the pain. But it\u2019s doing more than that,\" said Caroline Palmer, a psychologist at McGill University who studies music and pain.",
      "Scientists are still tracing the various neural pathways at work, said Palmer.",
      "\u201cWe know that almost all of the brain becomes active when we engage in music,\u201d said Kate Richards Geller, a registered music therapist in Los Angeles. \u201cThat changes the perception and experience of pain \u2014 and the isolation and anxiety of pain.\u201d",

      "Researchers at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands conducted a study on 548 participants to see how listening to five genres of music \u2014 classical, rock, pop, urban and electronic \u2014 extended their ability to withstand acute pain, as measured by exposure to very cold temperatures.",
      "All music helped, but there was no single winning genre.",
      "\u201cThe more people listened to a favorite genre, the more they could endure pain,\u201d said co-author Dr. Emy van der Valk Bouman. \u201cA lot of people thought that classical music would help them more. Actually, we are finding more evidence that what\u2019s best is just the music you like.\"",
      "The exact reasons are still unclear, but it may be because familiar songs activate more memories and emotions, she said.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 The Australian government has begun a public education campaign with tips on how to wean children off social media ahead of a world-first national 16-year age limit taking effect in December.",
      "Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said Friday that information on her agency's website, esafety.gov.au, explained the new laws and how to navigate them.",
      "Starting Dec. 10, platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube could be fined up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they don\u2019t take reasonable steps to prevent Australians younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "Messages raising awareness will also be shared starting Sunday across digital channels, television, radio and billboards.",
      "\u201cWe want children to have childhoods. We want parents to have peace of mind and we want young people \u2014 young Australians \u2014 to have three more years to learn who they are before platforms assume who they are,\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told reporters, referring to the current de facto 13-year age limit for social media accounts based on U.S. privacy legislation.",
      "The Australian age restrictions have already proved polarizing, with some experts warning the changes will harm as well as protect children. More than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to the government last year opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Despite that warning, the laws passed with resounding support last year. The platforms had a year to figure out how to comply without foolproof technology available to verify ages.",
      "Inman Grant said the social media age restriction would be a \u201cvery monumental event for a lot of young people.\u201d",
      "Her agency offered checklists and conversation starters about ways to make the transition, such as following an online influencer through a website rather than a social media account, she said.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

      "Microsoft is encouraging people to talk to their laptops with new AI updates to Windows 11",
      "Microsoft is encouraging people to talk to their laptops as it rolls out new artificial intelligence updates to Windows 11 and pushes users to phase out its predecessor, Windows 10.",
      "Microsoft ended free security support for Windows 10 this week, though millions of people still use personal computers running the older operating system.",
      "To entice people to upgrade, the software giant on Thursday announced new Windows 11 features, most of them further integrating the company's AI chatbot, Copilot, into the experience of using a laptop.",
      "Among the features is a voice mode that enables users to dictate \u201cHey, Copilot\u201d to start chatting with their computer instead of typing or clicking a touchpad.",
      "Microsoft first introduced Windows 10 a decade ago and launched its successor, Windows 11, in 2021.",
      "But many people around the world still are using Windows 10, particularly those with older computers that can't upgrade to Windows 11. Consumer advocates have spent months petitioning Microsoft to extend technical support for an estimated hundreds of millions of devices that will no longer get automatic security fixes.",
      "\u201cWith the end of Windows 10, users face the choice between exposing themselves to cyberattacks or discarding their old computers and buying new ones,\u201d said Brenna Stevens of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, which advocated on behalf of local repair shops, students and others.",
      "Microsoft has said people can pay extra for a year of extended security support through October 2026. Some users, including those in the European Union as well as U.S. users who can synchronize with Microsoft's cloud service, will be able to get that extended support for free.",

Both PIRG and Microsoft urge those who are replacing their computers to avoid sending their older models to the landfill.",
      "Those concerns were not a focus of Microsoft's Windows 11 announcements Thursday. Instead, Yusuf Mehdi, an executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Microsoft's consumer division, argued that conversing with a laptop will be \u201cas transformative as the mouse and keyboard\u201d in shaping the PC experience. Microsoft says all Windows 11 users will also now have access to Copilot Vision, an AI feature that can analyze and give feedback on the documents, video games and other activities happening on the screen.",

      "\u201cJust like when the mouse came out, people have to figure out when to use it, what\u2019s the right way, how to make it happen,\u201d Mehdi told reporters.",
      "The updates are Microsoft's latest attempt to make its widely used Windows operating system a gateway to hook people on its suite of generative AI tools. The tech giant competes heavily on AI services with Apple, Google and startups like Anthropic and OpenAI.",
      "Mehdi said the updates are \u201cnot a replacement for Recall,\" a screen-tracking feature on some Windows computers that gives Copilot a \"photographic memory\" of a user's virtual activity. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described it last year as a step toward machines that \u201cinstantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,\" but the idea was met with criticism from privacy and security experts and took a year before it started to roll out.",

      "A South Korean delegation visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, for talks with officials, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.",
      "South Koreans have been outraged by Cambodia\u2019s vast online scam industry, which uses trafficked workers from various countries to target victims around the world. Officials estimate that about 200,000 people, including some 1,000 South Koreans, are working at online scam sites in Cambodia.",

      "Wi earlier said the body\u2019s return was delayed due to disputes over South Korea\u2019s request for an autopsy by pathologists from both countries. He said the two sides reached agreement and the results of the talks would be announced later on Thursday.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how those 1,000 South Koreans have ended up working in online scam sites in Cambodia. But South Korean officials believe many were lured with promises of high-paying jobs before being forced to work against their will, but some also went there voluntarily.",
      "In the first eight months of this year alone, there were reports of 330 South Koreans detained in Cambodia, Wi said in an earlier briefing Wednesday, citing reports from victims themselves and their relatives. Wi said that 80% of those cases have been resolved.",

But he said South Korea will mobilize \u201call available methods\u201d to protect the safety and properties of South Koreans and promote coordination with Cambodia, neighboring countries and international organizations.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",

Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.",
      "Over the next few days, they used TikTok, Instagram and X to spotlight the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor, and announce planned rallies and venues. Later, some of them also used the gaming chat platform Discord to suggest who to nominate as an interim leader for the country.",
      "\u201cWhatever movement happens, whether against corruption or injustice, it spreads through digital media. The same happened in Nepal. The changes that took place after the Gen Z protests in Nepal spread globally through digital platforms, influencing other countries as well,\u201d said protester Yujan Rajbhandari.",
      "He said the protests in Nepal awakened not only the youth but also other generations.",

      "Researchers think they have debunked the origin of Chicago's so-called \u201crat hole,\u201d one of the Windy City's weirdest local landmarks.",
      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "Drivers are required to be at least 21, have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. They also need to pass a test and take a pre-service course.",
      "The bill marks an important step in the development of ride-hailing services in Hong Kong, which currently bans drivers of private vehicles from providing paid services to customers without a permit.",
      "Uber Hong Kong welcomed the voting results. \u201cThis decision marks a significant milestone in integrating ridesharing into the city\u2019s transport system and ensuring riders and drivers benefit from clear rules,\u201d it said.",

      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",
      "James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said Newsom's veto of the bill was \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 AI companion chatbots,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.",
      "Steyer also said the notification law didn't go far enough, saying it \u201cprovides minimal protections for children and families.\"",

The mother of a teenage boy in Florida who died by suicide after developing what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a chatbot has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Character.AI. And the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine recently sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier this year.",
      "OpenAI and Meta last month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress.",

      "It was over four centuries ago to the day Saturday that Filipinos set foot on the North American continent for the first time. Now, Filipino Americans are working to sustain a cultural footprint.",
      "During celebration of October's Filipino American History Month, many Filipinos are seeking their cities' acknowledgment of \u201cFilipino Towns\u201d \u2014 a cultural district designation similar to Chinatowns, Japantowns and Koreatowns that highlights the contributions of expat and immigrant populations to a major city's overall identity.",
      "That recognition can be through landmarks, event support or even permanent signage. Three years ago, Los Angeles' Historic Filipinotown \u2014 first designated as a neighborhood in 2002 \u2014 constructed a gateway arch, and Little Manila in New York City's Queens borough debuted an official street sign. Now, Las Vegas has joined the club.",
      "An official \u201cFilipino Town Cultural District\u201d street sign was unveiled last week to great fanfare \u2014 six months after Clark County commissioners unanimously passed a resolution affirming the distinction.",
      "\u201cThat was a great day,\u201d Rozita Lee, the original Filipino Town Las Vegas board president, recalled about the county's approval. \u201cA great day because we realized that the government actually recognized us Filipinos as a valid, solid entity here in Nevada. We were all so happy.\u201d",
      "Lee, 90, has lived in Las Vegas for nearly 50 years. She has seen a 1.2-mile (1.6-kilometer) corridor east of the Strip blossom with Filipino small businesses, a radio station and chains like Seafood City supermarket and Jollibee. Last year, the Filipino Town board's first step was to gather data to bolster their proposal. Filipinos are the largest Asian group in metro Las Vegas with over 200,000.",
      "They also spread the word among business owners.",
      "\u201cWe visited the people that were in the area because we had to knock on doors and let them know of the possibility of this area being named Filipino Town, and would they support,\u201d Lee said. \u201cEverybody said yes.\u201d",
      "Now resigned from the board, Lee is currently planning a Filipino American Museum.",
      "Current board president Bernie Benito is looking forward to making Filipino Town a site that tourists will consider.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to try to do is just to promote it culturally. We\u2019re going to entice developers, investors to come into the area in order to set up their businesses,\u201d Benito said.",

      "Pre-World War II, there were some Filipino enclaves made up mostly of single men. They were not as prevalent as Chinatowns and Japantowns. A lot of them either were demolished or floundered as some men moved away, said Joseph Bernardo, an adjunct professor in Asian Pacific American Studies at Loyola Marymount University.",

Devin Cabanilla, executive director of Filipinotown Seattle, is also a contract worker for King County Metro Transit. He applied to get the special streetcar.",

It has always included Filipinos supporting and living in the district.\u201d",

      "Democrats are calling on President Donald Trump to get more involved with negotiations to end the government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is showing little urgency to broker a compromise that would end the government shutdown, even as Democrats insist no breakthrough is possible without his direct involvement.",
      "Three weeks in, Congress is at a standstill. The House hasn\u2019t been in session for a month, and senators left Washington on Thursday frustrated by the lack of progress. Republican leaders are refusing to negotiate until a short-term funding bill to reopen the government is passed, while Democrats say they won\u2019t agree without guarantees on extending health insurance subsidies.",
      "For now, Trump appears content to stay on the sidelines.",
      "He spent the week celebrating an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal he led, hosted a remembrance event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk and refocused attention on the Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, his administration has been managing the shutdown in unconventional ways, continuing to pay the troops while laying off other federal employees.",
      "Asked Thursday whether he was willing to deploy his dealmaking background on the shutdown, Trump seemed uninterested.",
      "\u201cWell, look, I mean, all we want to do is just extend. We don\u2019t want anything, we just want to extend, live with the deal they had,\u201d he said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. Later Thursday, he criticized Democratic health care demands as \u201ccrazy,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to do it.\u201d",
      "Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Democrats must first vote to reopen the government, \u201cthen we can have serious conversations about health care.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune echoed that approach before leaving for the weekend, saying Trump is \u201cready to weigh in and sit down with the Democrats or whomever, once the government opens up.\u201d",
      "Still, frustration is starting to surface even within Trump\u2019s own party, where lawmakers acknowledge little happens in Congress without his direction.",
      "Leaving the Capitol on Thursday, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said, \u201cWe\u2019re not making much headway this week.\u201d For things to progress, Murkowski acknowledged Trump may need to get more involved: \u201cI think he\u2019s an important part of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are some folks in his administration that are kind of liking the fact that Congress really has no role right now,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201d",
      "While Congress has been paralyzed by the shutdown, Trump has moved rapidly to enact his vision of the federal government.",
      "He has called budget chief Russ Vought the \u201cgrim reaper,\u201d and Vought has taken the opportunity to withhold billions of dollars for infrastructure projects and lay off thousands of federal workers, signaling that workforce reductions could become even more drastic.",
      "At the same time, the administration has acted unilaterally to fund Trump\u2019s priorities, including paying the military this week, easing pressure on what could have been one of the main deadlines to end the shutdown.",
      "Some of these moves, particularly the layoffs and funding shifts, have been criticized as illegal and are facing court challenges. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, ruling that the cuts appeared politically motivated and were carried out without sufficient justification.",
      "And with Congress focused on the funding fight, lawmakers have had little time to debate other issues.",
      "In the House, Johnson has said the House won\u2019t return until Democrats approve the funding bill and has refused to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Democrats say the move is to prevent her from becoming the 218th signature on a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on releasing documents related to the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "So far, the shutdown has shown little impact on public opinion.",
      "An AP-NORC poll released Thursday found that 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of the Democratic Party, similar to an AP-NORC poll from September. Four in 10 have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of the Republican Party, largely unchanged from last month.",

      "Trump has largely followed that guidance. After previously saying he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health insurance subsidies, he walked it back after Republican leaders suggested he misspoke.",
      "And that's unlikely to change for now. Trump has no plans to personally intervene to broker a deal with Democrats, according to a senior White House official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations. The official added that the only stopgap funding bill that Democrats can expect is the one already on the table.",

When that doesn\u2019t work, he has vowed to unseat them in the next election. It\u2019s led many Democrats to believe the only path to an agreement runs through the White House and not through the speaker\u2019s office.",
      "Democrats also want assurances from the White House that they won't backtrack on an agreement. The White House earlier this year cut out the legislative branch entirely with a $4.9 billion cut to foreign aid in August through a legally dubious process known as a \u201cpocket rescission.\u201d And before he even took office late last year, Trump and ally Elon Musk blew up a bipartisan funding agreement that both parties had negotiated.",

      "Legal experts say U.S. strikes against alleged members of Latin American drug cartels are pushing the bounds of international law",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Under President Donald Trump, the drug war is looking a lot like the war on terror.",
      "To support strikes against Latin American gangs and drug cartels, the Trump administration is relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which allowed U.S. authorities to use lethal force against al-Qaida combatants who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.",
      "The criminal groups now being targeted by U.S. strikes are a very different foe, however, spawned in the prisons of Venezuela, and fueled not by anti-Western ideology but by drug trafficking and other illicit enterprises.",
      "Trump\u2019s use of overwhelming military force to combat such groups and authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars say. It comes as Trump expands the military\u2019s domestic role, deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities and saying he's open to invoking the nearly 150-year-old Insurrection Act, which allows for military deployment in only exceptional instances of civil unrest.",
      "So far, the military has killed at least 27 people in five strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes \u2014 the most recent came Tuesday, in which the U.S. killed six people \u2014 have occurred without any legal investigation or a traditional declaration of war from Congress. That raises questions about the justifications for Trump's actions and the impact they could have on diplomatic relations with Latin American nations who recall with deep resentment repeated U.S. military interventions during the Cold War.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community has also disputed Trump's central claim that Maduro\u2019s administration is working with the Tren de Aragua gang and orchestrating drug trafficking and illegal immigration into the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s assertion that the United States is engaged in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels is based on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after the Sept. 11 attacks. That includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.",
      "But the United Nations charter specifically forbids the use of force except in self-defense.",
      "\u201cYou just can\u2019t call something war to give yourself war powers,\u201d said Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cHowever frustrated we may be with the means and results of law enforcement efforts to combat the flow of drugs, it makes a mockery of international law to suggest we are in a noninternational armed conflict with cartels.\u201d",
      "After 9/11, it was clear that al-Qaida was actively plotting additional attacks designed to kill civilians. But the cartels' main ambition is selling dope. And that, while harmful to American security overall, is a dubious justification for invoking war powers, said Geoffrey Corn, a Texas Tech law professor who previously served as the Army\u2019s senior adviser for law-of-war issues.",
      "\u201cThis is the government, in my humble opinion, wanting to invoke war powers for a lot of reasons\" \u2014 including political ones, Corn said.",
      "\u201cEven if we assume there\u2019s an armed conflict with Tren de Aragua, how do we know everyone in that boat was an enemy fighter?\u201d he said. \u201cI think Congress needs to know that.\u201d",
      "Asked at the White House on Wednesday why the U.S. does not use the Coast Guard to stop the Venezuelan vessels and seize any drugs, Trump replied, \u201cWe have been doing that for 30 years and it has been totally ineffective.\u201d",
      "The president also suggested the U.S. may strike targets inside Venezuela, a move that would significantly escalate tensions and the legal stakes. So far, the strikes have occurred in international waters beyond the jurisdiction of any single country.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve almost totally stopped it by sea,\" Trump said of flow of drugs. \"Now we\u2019ll stop it by land.\u201d",

      "Trump was also asked about a New York Times report saying he had authorized a covert CIA operation in Venezuela. Trump, who has harshly criticized the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein, declined to say whether he had given the CIA authority to take out Maduro, saying it would be \u201cridiculous\" to answer.",
      "Numerous U.S. laws and executive orders since the 1970s make it illegal to assassinate foreign officials. But in declaring the Venezuelans unlawful combatants, Trump may be seeking to sidestep those restrictions and return to an earlier era in which the United States \u2014 in places like Guatemala, Chile and Iran \u2014 regularly carried out covert regime change missions.",
      "\u201cIf you pose a threat, and are making war on the U.S., you\u2019re not a protected person,\" Finkelstein said.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being \u201cone of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.\u201d",
      "But Trump's focus on Venezuela overlooks a basic fact of the drug trade: The bulk of American overdose deaths are from fentanyl, which is transported by land from Mexico. And while Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, around 75% of the cocaine produced in Colombia, the world's leader, is smuggled through the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean.",
      "Under the Constitution, it must be Congress that declares war. So far, though, there has been little indication that Trump's allies will push back on the president's expansionist view of his own power to go after cartels the White House blames for tens of thousands of American overdose deaths each year.",
      "The GOP-controlled Senate recently voted down a war powers resolution sponsored by Democrats that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes.",
      "Despite pressure even among some Republicans for a more complete account, the Trump administration has yet to provide underlying evidence to lawmakers proving that the boats targeted by the U.S. military were carrying narcotics, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said he and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in a classified briefing this month were also denied access to the Pentagon\u2019s legal opinion about whether the strikes adhered to U.S. law.",
      "Legal pushback isn't likely to sway the White House either. A Supreme Court decision arising from an attempt in 1973 by a Democratic congresswoman to sue the Pentagon to stop the spread of the Vietnam War to neighboring Laos and Cambodia set a high bar for any legal challenge of military orders, Finkelstein said.",
      "Meanwhile, relatives of the Venezuelans killed in the boat attacks face their own obstacles following several high court rulings narrowing the scope of foreign citizens to sue in the U.S.",
      "The military strikes took place in international waters, opening the door for the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation along the lines of its war crimes probes against Russia and Israel \u2014 which, like the United States, don\u2019t recognize the court\u2019s authority.",
      "But the Hague-based court has been consumed by a sexual misconduct probe that forced its chief prosecutor to step aside. U.S. sanctions over its indictment of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have also hindered its work.",

      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A man who was convicted of killing four members of a Phoenix family over 30 years ago as an act of revenge is set to be put to death Friday in what is set be Arizona's second execution of the year.",
      "Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, is scheduled to die by pentobarbital injection at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence.",
      "He pleaded guilty to murder in the deaths of couple Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who has been in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.",
      "If the execution is carried out, it will be the fourth in the country this week and the 39th of the year.",
      "Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.",
      "Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat and stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them. During Friday's execution, a team of four people including medical doctors and a phlebotomist will prepare syringes of saline and pentobarbital, insert an IV and inject the chemicals into Djerf. Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death. The state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.",

(AP) \u2014 Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squabbled over a host of lawyerly issues on Thursday in their first and only debate: criminal prosecutions, consumer protection and unlawful discrimination. But one matter overshadowed it all: Jones' leaked text messages endorsing political violence toward a former colleague.",
      "Miyares, the Republican incumbent running for reelection, pushed hard against Jones for suggesting to a Republican delegate in 2022 text messages that former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get \u201ctwo bullets to the head.\u201d",
      "Referencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, Miyares started the debate by saying: \u201cCharacter is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he (Jones) was doing in the dark.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?\u201d Jones said, adding, \u201cYou haven\u2019t said a word. I\u2019ve taken accountability for my mistakes. It\u2019s time you take accountability, too.\u201d",
      "The race for attorney general of Virginia has emerged as one of the most competitive statewide contests in this year's election, with members of both parties taking an interest in the down-ballot race. Straight-ticket voting is not an option in Virginia, which requires voters to choose candidates in each statewide contest.",
      "While Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has faced setbacks in her race for governor, as has John Reid, the GOP lieutenant governor nominee, the attorney general\u2019s race remains fiercely competitive.

Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, refused to say during a debate whether she still supported Jones' candidacy, suggesting it was up to the voters to decide.",
      "Jones and Miyares tangled over the violent text message for much of the debate. The way Miyares told it, Jones' texts about shooting a prominent Republican disqualified him from the race to be Virginia's lead prosecutor.",

Days after that shooting, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen near the Mexico border, injuring a police officer.

      "LAS CUEVAS, Trinidad -- LAS CUEVAS, Trinidad (AP) \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Samuel Moncada, condemned on Thursday a recent U.S. strike on a small boat in Caribbean waters that killed six people, calling it \u201ca new set of extrajudicial executions.\u201d",
      "He called on the U.N. Security Council to investigate what he called a \u201cseries of assassinations,\u201d noting there have been five lethal attacks and 27 reported deaths since the strikes in the Caribbean began in September, targeting what U.S. officials say are suspected drug traffickers.",
      "Among those believed to be killed in the latest strike that occurred Tuesday are two fishermen from Trinidad and Tobago, whom Moncada referenced in his speech.",
      "As Moncada spoke at the U.N. on Thursday, people in the sleepy fishing town of Las Cuevas in northern Trinidad mourned the disappearance of Chad Joseph. His relatives believe he was killed in the strike, although they offered no other evidence that he was aboard the boat that was hit.",

      "But in recent weeks, Clement said he told the family that he was disappointed with the money he was making and planned to come back home.",
      "On Tuesday, he boarded a boat bound for Trinidad and was expected to arrive on Wednesday, Clement said.",
      "But no one has heard from him from since then.",
      "His family has called and texted him to no avail as they condemned the strikes.",
      "\u201cHe was a quiet person,\u201d Christine Clement, Joseph\u2019s grandmother, said from her living room. \u201cHe has left the whole village in sadness.\u201d",
      "The Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, a local newspaper, reported that also missing is a man only identified as \u201cSamaroo.\u201d",
      "At U.N. headquarters, Moncada held up the newspaper\u2019s front page that detailed the lives of the two men from Trinidad.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Republican legislators offered a redrawn U.S. House district map for North Carolina on Thursday, seeking to help President Donald Trump retain GOP control of Congress by attempting to thwart the reelection of the Democrat now in the state's only swing seat.",
      "State House and Senate GOP leaders unveiled the proposed boundaries in advance of next week's General Assembly session, stepping into the national fray over mid-decade redistricting that has Democrats and Republicans battling to secure electoral advantages from coast to coast, including Texas and California. The Republicans announced earlier this week that legislators would return to Raleigh to debate and vote on a plan provided in response to Trump\u2019s call to secure more GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "An intensely competitive midterm election looms in which Democrats need to gain just three seats to take control of the House. The president\u2019s party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, something Trump is trying to avoid.",
      "Republicans already approved a North Carolina map in 2023 that resulted in GOP candidates winning 10 of the state\u2019s 14 U.S. House seats in 2024. That compared to a 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022.",
      "As anticipated, Thursday's boundaries appear, based on past election results, to focus on helping the GOP win the 1st District seat in northeastern North Carolina currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis. He won a second term in 2024 by less than 2 percentage points.",
      "The retooled 1st District boundaries would take in several coastal counties and remove others inland \u2014 including Greene County, Davis' home county \u2014 to create a little more right-leaning 1st District. Greene and others would be placed in a reworked 3rd District currently represented by Republican Rep. Greg Murphy, which based on election results would appear to become a little less GOP friendly.",
      "Other districts to the west would remain intact. Based on results of several past statewide elections attached to the map, Republicans would stand a decent chance to win 11 of North Carolina's 14 seats.",
      "Republican legislators provided no formal comment on the proposal while inviting online comment from the public. But with an image of the new map, Senate leader Phil Berger wrote Thursday on X that the General Assembly \u201cis ready to help Republicans secure Congress and move @realDonaldTrump\u2019s agenda forward!\u201d",

The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",

The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",

      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",

      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

    "story": [
      "Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, died on Thursday, his family and agent said. He was 74.",
      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall at his home, his agent said.",
      "Family members said in a statement\u00a0that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken.\"",
      "\"In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" Frehley's family said. \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\"",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",
      "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager, John Ostrosky, also known as John Ostronomy, said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0last month addressed to fans. Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",
      "In 2024, the band sold its catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be more than $300 million."

      "In his memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Oct. 21 by Grand Central), actor Tim Curry, renowned for such fan favorites as \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and \"Clue,\" writes of a multitude of journeys in his life pursuing various channels of creative expression (often in the guise of an irresistible villain), and of the 2012 stroke that nearly ended this vagabond's adventures.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Ben Mankiewicz's interview with Tim Curry on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 19!",
      "\"Vagabond: A Memoir\" by Tim Curry",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

      "Jeremy Allen White becomes \"The Boss\" in a new film, channeling Bruce Springsteen's raw vulnerability during one of the most introspective chapters of his life.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

In a statement shared by the festival, D'Angelo said that his doctors had advised he not perform. D'Angelo did not specify what kind of surgery he had had or what complications he was experiencing.",

    "story": [
      "The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation Cargill. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.",
      "\"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals \u2013 they're all encouraging more protein after lifting,\" said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.",
      "The protein boom",
      "Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, according to Mintel, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights reported, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.",
      "Chains like Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that \"consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",
      "Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.",
      "\"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly,\" Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition, said.",
      "Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.",
      "But \"today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need,\" Byrne said.",
      "Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.",
      "Consumer Reports recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their investigation, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.",
      "\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"",

      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",
      "High-protein foods",
      "\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.",

      "Washington \u2014 A scientist laid off by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said \"the everyday American should be very concerned\" by reductions in force amid the government shutdown.",
      "The scientist, one of hundreds of CDC employees terminated by the Trump administration last week, asked that her identity be concealed for fear of retribution.",
      "\"It's going to mean more deaths, more preventable deaths,\" she told CBS News on Wednesday of the layoffs. \"People will absolutely die from the impact of this administration.\"",
      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

(Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have fully installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 14:51:29 -0400",
    "summary": "The rush for gold continues as economic uncertainty deepens and anxious investors seek a safe haven for their money.",
    "story": [
      "As economic uncertainty deepens the rush for gold continues, with the price of the precious metal this week topping $4,300 for the first time.",
      "The going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a \"safe haven\" for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad \u2014 with President Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable.",
      "Still, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.",
      "Gold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 \u2014 trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That's up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.",
      "Silver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of this year's economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market.",
      "As a result, hiring has plunged\u00a0while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.",
      "Separately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point \u2014 and projected it would do so twice more this year.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there's been strong gold demand from central banks around the world \u2014 particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "And on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency \u2014 with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.",
      "Gold jewelry sticker shock",
      "Many jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own \u2014 sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal's rising price.",
      "At the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling \"sticker shock\" if they can't afford certain products anymore \u2014 particularly if it's something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.",
      "Larger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.",
      "Advocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven \u2014 arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic\u00a0growth has accelerated\u00a0in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell recently told CBS News.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment.",
      "Not always a reliable inflation hedge",
      "Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,\" the commission noted.",
      "The frenzy for gold has also resulted in health and environmental consequences \u2014 with officials pointing to rising demand for mercury, a toxic metal that is key in illegal gold mining worldwide.",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during artisanal or small-scale mining. But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people's bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks \u2014 putting in danger workers who rely on the industry, as well as residents in affected areas more broadly.",
      "The Associated Press has reported about the effects of mercury poisoning tied to gold mining in countries like Senegal, Mexico and Peru, among other parts of the world."

      "Other customers have complained about the noise in online forums such as Reddit, with some\u00a0posting hacks for trying to stop the shoes from squeaking.

      "Federal officials have flagged more air traffic control facilities for low staffing levels in recent days than they have since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom sent delays and cancellations soaring, according to a CBS News data analysis of Federal Aviation Administration airspace advisories.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",

    "summary": "A new scam involves fake letters that appear to be from U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts \u2014 but it's a ploy to trick seniors, agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "It looks official \u2014 a letter stamped with the U.S. Supreme Court seal, signed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, warning that you're under investigation. But it's a scam \u2014 one designed to steal money from Social Security recipients, according to the agency's watchdog division.",
      "The fake SCOTUS letter prompted an Oct. 8 warning from the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General, cautioning the program's 75 million beneficiaries to be on alert if they receive a purported letter from the nation's highest court.",
      "While the warning didn't disclose how many Social Security recipients have been targeted by the fraud, the watchdog group said the hoax marks the evolution of government imposter scams, such as the decade-old scheme in which criminals\u00a0pretend to be IRS officials\u00a0informing their target victims that they're under investigation for tax fraud. The threat of an IRS probe has long been used by scammers to scare individuals into providing money or private data such as Social Security numbers.",
      "In this latest version of the same scheme, fraudsters are impersonating Supreme Court justices, rather than IRS officials. The new scam relies on multiple points of contact, with a fake letter followed by a text or call from the fraudsters, making it appear more authentic, said John Haraburda, Transaction Network Services (TNS) robocall data expert and director of product management.",
      "\"The fraudsters get very, very smart,\" Haraburda said. \"They do the mailing, then they'll send you a text from the number they're going to use for the phone call saying, 'This is the Social Security Administration \u2014 we're going to be calling you from this number in a few seconds.'\"",
      "He added, \"Then you've got this text message in a way authenticating the call that's coming in. That lets you break down your hesitation, to basically drop your guard.\"",
      "According to the Social Security Inspector General, the scam letter is personally addressed to the would-be victim, warning that they're a suspect in connection with legal proceedings and criminal charges. It also falsely claims their Social Security number has been compromised.",
      "The fake letter goes on to say that the Supreme Court has requested financial institutions to freeze the recipient's assets, and urges them to cooperate with \"the U.S. Treasury Department,\" the watchdog agency said.",
      "\"The letter ominously closes by stating, should the recipient encounter any difficulties in safeguarding assets, the recipient will bear full liability for any losses incurred following the suspension of their SSN,\" the SSA's inspector general said. \"Scammers most likely will follow up with text messages or telephone calls.\"",
      "Scammers may follow up with a text that includes a link to a fake Social Security site, which will capture the victim's login and password as they attempt to gain access to their accounts, or might ask for credit card info, Haraburda said.",
      "Never click on a link in an email or text that purports to be from an official, he noted. Instead, go directly to the Social Security site \u2014 https://www.ssa.gov \u2014 to log in.",
      "\"On every level, this letter is completely false,\" Michelle L. Anderson, acting inspector general at the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General said in a statement. \"These criminals are falsely accusing an individual of a crime and using federal agencies and federal officials to try to scare and legitimize their scam \u2014 if you get this type of letter, rip it up and report it.\""

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",

      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",

      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports during the U.S. government shutdown may have travelers wondering if they have anything to worry about as they board their flight.",
      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed potential safety concerns during the shutdown on Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure that when you travel you travel safely, and so if we don't have controllers necessary to keep you safe, we slow it down,\" he told the network.",
      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-rural-health-fund-trump-medicaid-cuts/",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "States are battling for their piece of $50 billion in federal rural health funding, but it's not just hospitals vying for the money. Tech startups and policy demands are raising the stakes as Medicaid cuts loom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.",
      "Rather, states should submit applications that \"rebuild and reshape\" how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at D.C.'s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors' office staffers and state health agency leaders \u2014 some from as far away as Hawaii.",
      "\"This isn't a backfill of operating budgets,\" said Sutton, CMS' innovation director. \"We've been really clear on that.\"",
      "Rural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Trump's massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill's financial fallout for rural hospitals.",
      "Yet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency's leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.",
      "It's \"what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,\" said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.",
      "Applications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.",
      "Half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "The application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as \"symptom checkers and AI chatbots.\"",
      "In September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money \"will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.\"",
      "Smaller hospitals fear they will get \"a tiny little slice\" of each state's share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.",
      "\"There's a lot of frustration,\" Felder said.",
      "But Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet \"is really just throwing good money after bad.\" In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.",
      "One of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.",
      "The company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.",
      "\"They're doing their job, and they're talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,\" Schneider said. \"We're one of many in that position.\"",
      "KFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was \"unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.\"",
      "Instead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program \"will help states and communities reimagine what's possible for rural healthcare.\"",
      "Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn't \"sexy\" or \"revolutionary.\"",
      "\"If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don't think that's transformational,\" Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.",
      "Slabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money \u2014 including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating \"SWAT\" teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.",
      "More than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 \u2014 a statistic cited by CMS' Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.",
      "State applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.",
      "\"We will train them in the scoring criteria,\" Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from \"your state\" and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.",
      "States are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.",
      "In Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.",
      "\"It's one-time money, and it's a little bit of money,\" said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.",
      "\"How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?\" Mark said.",
      "Neither Montana nor Wyoming \u2014 vast, rural states \u2014 sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.",
      "Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were \"stretched with other commitments.\" Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.",
      "During the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.",
      "\"I think Arkansas' application is going to be better than yours,\" seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.",
      "The audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee's Bill Lee.",
      "\"See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,\" Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, \"I look forward to us both winning.\"",
      "KFF Health News Montana correspondent Katheryn Houghton contributed to this report.",

      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

    "summary": "A new lawsuit alleges Bank of America profited from its dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Bank of America was sued Wednesday over its alleged financial ties with Jeffrey Epstein, with the lawsuit claiming the financial giant facilitated and also benefited from his alleged sex trafficking venture.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of a Jane Doe, alleges Epstein committed his crimes \"through access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including Bank of America.\" Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "\"Egregiously, Bank of America had a plethora of information regarding Epstein's sex trafficking operation but chose profit over protecting the victims,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Bank of America said it has no immediate comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, opened an investigation into four large banks, including Bank of America, over their business relationship with Epstein. The probe is seeking more information about roughly $1.5 billion in financial transactions handled by the banks on behalf of Epstein.",
      "Suspicious activity?",
      "Jane Doe was living in Russia when she met Epstein in 2011, and was sexually abused and trafficked by him until 2019, the lawsuit alleges. It claims Epstein relied on force, threats, fraud and coercion to control her.",
      "In 2013, Epstein's accountant instructed her to open a Bank of America account, where money could be wired, purportedly to generate records for U.S. immigration authorities and to cover her rent, according to the lawsuit. The banking transactions should have raised red flags with the bank, the complaint alleges.",
      "\"A review of Jane Doe's account history will show incredibly alarming and erratic banking behavior, as Epstein, through one of his loyal employees, would utilize Jane Doe's account, often without her knowledge, to conduct business in amounts that were not typical for Jane Doe, and that would have in fact been impossible based on Jane Doe's income or typical pattern of deposit,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Banks are required by law to report suspicious activity in customer accounts to federal authorities in order to flag potential criminal activity, such as money laundering or fraud. The complaint alleges that Bank of America failed to file suspicious activity reports, known as SARs, until after Epstein's death in 2019.",
      "According to the New York Times, Bank of America\u00a0filed two SARs in 2020 related to $170 million in payments made to Epstein by billionaire investor Leon Black. The timing of the SARs was questioned by Raskin in an October 2025 letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "\"These SARs not only were untimely \u2014 filed years after the transactions in question \u2014 but Bank of America processed the payments without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,\" Raskin wrote. \"Financial institutions are often the first line of defense in detecting serious federal crimes, especially the ones that involve significant flows of money like sex trafficking.\"",
      "He added, \"Flagging and detecting Mr. Epstein's suspicious withdrawals may well have stopped his crimes years earlier.\"",
      "The Oct. 15 lawsuit claims that \"Bank of America's failure to timely file SARs about Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, in spite of numerous red flags, was wrongful and purposeful.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges that Epstein would not have been able to expand his illegal operations \"without complicit financial banking institutions that would ignore red flags and assist him in his sex-trafficking scheme.\"",
      "JPMorgan's settlement",
      "In exchange for looking the other way, the suit alleges, Bank of America profited by earning \"interest, commissions, service fees, and other financial benefits directly from its connection with Epstein, Epstein-related entities, and others acting in concert with Epstein.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase reached a\u00a0$290 million settlement with Epstein's victims over allegations the bank overlooked his crimes because of the profits it earned from him. At the time of the settlement, JPMorgan said it regretted its association with Epstein and that it \"would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\"",
      "The lawsuit against Bank of America is seeking class-action status on behalf of other women abused by Epstein. The attorney representing Jane Doe is David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who represented Epstein's victims in the settlement with JPMorgan."

      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

      "The complaint is the largest forfeiture action in the history of the Department of Justice, according to the agency.",

      "\"Today the FBI and partners executed one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement. \"This is an individual who allegedly operated a vast criminal network across multiple continents involving forced labor, money laundering, investment schemes, and stolen assets \u2014 targeting millions of innocent victims in the process.\"",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control\u00a0announced Tuesday that it has coordinated with U.K. officials to impose sweeping sanctions against 146 entities associated with the Prince Group, which has been formally designated a transnational criminal organization by the department.",
      "Prince Holding Group's website lists it as one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia, with businesses focused on real estate development, banking, finance and consumer services.",

The scammers then stole the funds, laundered them and used the proceeds for luxury travel, entertainment and other extravagant purchases, according to the agency.",
      "Allegations of human trafficking",
      "Federal prosecutors said Prince Group targeted victims around the world with assistance from local networks, including one operated from Brooklyn, New York. To carry out the schemes, the criminal actors allegedly trafficked hundreds of people and forced them to work in a network of compounds across Cambodia. The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",
      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",

      "\"Cambodia is the physical location where a lot of it operates, but it's also the money laundering center for the entire region,\" Taylor said",

      "Instagram-parent Meta announced Tuesday that teen users will now see content on Instagram that's similar to what they might see while watching a film with a PG-13 rating.",
      "That's because new content settings for Instagram users under 18 will adhere to the same regulations. The new automatic protections are being rolled by the company starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, according to Meta.",
      "\"We hope this update reassures parents that we're working to show teens safe, age-appropriate content on Instagram by default, while also giving them more ways to shape their teen's experience,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "PG-13, a rating used in the media industry, indicates that parental guidance is suggested when watching content, particularly for children under 13.",
      "What are the new restrictions?",
      "The accounts of Instagram users under 18 will now be automatically be placed under a 13+ setting. Opting out of the setting will require parental permission.",
      "Teens with the setting will be blocked from seeing search results for terms like \"alcohol\" or \"gore.\" This adds to list of search topics from which Meta said it already shields teens, such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.",

    "summary": "The U.S. economy picked up speed in the second half of the year, although job growth and inflation remain a concern, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy could be on the upswing even if tariffs and stubborn inflation continue to weigh on growth, according to a new analysis.",
      "The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) said Monday it expects the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 a measure of the total value of goods and services \u2014 to rise 1.8% in 2025, up from the group's previous estimate in June of 1.3%.",
      "The survey, which was conducted from Sept. 17-25, consulted 40 economists on their forecasts for labor growth, inflation and other key metrics for the remainder of the year and into 2026. NABE also expects the economy to expand at a faster pace in 2026, at 1.7%, higher than its June forecast of 1.4%.",
      "The report is the latest signal that economic growth continues to hold up despite rising inflation and a recent slowdown in the labor market. After\u00a0economic activity shrank in the first three months of 2025, growth has accelerated over the rest of the year, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco, vice president of NABE, told CBS News. The outlook for business investment in particular has improved, he noted.",
      "The economy could get a further boost this year from the Federal Reserve. NABE expects Fed officials, who trimmed their benchmark rate in September for the first time since 2024, to lower borrowing costs by another quarter of a percentage point by year-end and by a total of three-quarters of percentage point in 2026.",
      "Pain points remain",
      "While the economy has performed better than many experts predicted earlier this year, there are still signs of weakness. Government data indicates that job growth has deteriorated since the first half of the year.",
      "As hiring cools, meanwhile, the percentage of long-term job seekers \u2014 people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26% of the total unemployed population, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "Layoffs are also climbing. Through September, employers this year have cut nearly 950,000 jobs, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Looking ahead, NABE expects the job market to remain fragile. Economists predict average monthly payroll gains of 60,000 for the rest the year, down from the 87,000 the group forecasted in June. From January to August, employers added an average of around 75,000 jobs per month, according to government data.",
      "NABE projects that the nation's unemployment rate,\u00a04.3 % as of August, will rise to 4.5% in 2026.",
      "Another lingering pain point for the economy is inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% annual target. NABE expects inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure index \u2014 the Fed's preferred measure of inflation \u2014 to rise at an annualized rate of 3% over the rest of 2025.",
      "Nearly all of those surveyed \u2014 95% \u2014 expect U.S. tariffs to drive up consumer prices over the rest of the year, according to NABE, although the group now expects stepped-up duties on imports to have less of an inflationary impact than it previously predicted. As a result, inflation is projected to cool to 2.5% by the end of 2026, according to the panel of economists.",
      "A recession is unlikely, according to NABE. Most of the economists polled by the group put the odds of a slump in the next 12 months at between 20% and less than 40%."

      "Hamas responded by calling the move \"a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.\"",

      "Federal agents deployed tear gas on a crowd on Tuesday on the South Side of Chicago following a crash involving a federal vehicle. That use of tear gas\u00a0prompted a federal judge\u00a0Thursday to express concern and issue an order Friday that agents in Chicago wear body cameras in response\u00a0to a lawsuit\u00a0brought by several media organizations over allegations that forceful tactics were being used by federal agents against protesters and journalists.",

    "story": [
      "Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, two of President Trump's key negotiators in brokering the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, \"felt a little bit betrayed\" by Israeli airstrikes on Qatar during peace talks last month, they said in an exclusive \"60 Minutes\" interview.",
      "Witkoff learned about the strike, which Israel said targeted senior Hamas leadership in Doha, the morning after it happened. At the time, Mr. Trump wrote on social media, \"This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me.\"",
      "\"I think both Jared and I felt, I just feel we felt a little bit betrayed,\" Witkoff told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl.",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's reaction, Kushner said, \"I think he felt like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing, and that it was time to be very strong and stop them from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests.\"",
      "According to Witkoff, Israel's strike in Qatar impeded negotiations because Qatar was the negotiators' link to Hamas.",
      "\"It had a metastasizing effect because the Qataris were critical to the negotiation, as were the Egyptians and the Turks,\" Witkoff said. \"We had lost the confidence of the Qataris. And so Hamas went underground, and it was very, very difficult to get to them.\"",
      "Finally, Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an \"agreed upon line.\" On Monday, 20 living hostages were released. Hamas has also handed over the remains of other hostages.",
      "Stahl's full report on \"The Dealmakers\" is set to air on \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday. Witkoff and Kushner discuss meeting with Hamas in person during negotiations. They also explain more about the next phase of the 20-point peace plan, which deals with disarmament, troop pullback, rebuilding and post-war governance in Gaza."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 17:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to allow the deployment of National Guard members in Illinois.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to allow the deployment of National Guard members in Illinois, teeing up a showdown over the president's power to send troops into jurisdictions over the objections of local authorities.",
      "The Justice Department is asking the high court to freeze a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from ordering the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops within Illinois. A U.S. appeals court on Thursday upheld the decision as to the deployment of service members, but allowed the Guard to remain under federal service while legal proceedings continue.",
      "In a request for emergency relief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the order from a U.S. district court judge \"countermands the exercise of the President's Commander-in-Chief authority and projects its own authority into the military chain of command.\"",
      "He argued that forbidding the deployment of federalized Guard troops \"eviscerates\" Mr. Trump's decision to call into federal service 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to protect federal immigration officers and government property. The president also federalized up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard to assist in the Chicago area.",
      "\"It deprives DHS officers of the protections that the President sought to give them from ongoing violence, prevents the Guard from ensuring the enforcement of federal law, and puts lives and property in danger,\" Sauer wrote. \"It also places the Seventh Circuit in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the President's Commander-in-Chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the President can deploy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has invoked a law known as Title 10 to federalize National Guard troops to protect immigration personnel and government facilities in several cities, where protests have sprung up in response to the administration's immigration agenda. The law allows the president to call the members of any state's National Guard into federal service if there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the U.S. government, or if the president \"is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that demonstrations in some cities, including outside of Chicago, satisfy those conditions, allowing the president to exercise his authority under Title 10. In Illinois, government officials have argued that \"violence and the constant threat of violence\" have left regular federal law enforcement forces in Chicago unable to fully execute U.S. immigration laws, as well as those against assaulting and obstructing federal officers.",
      "The administration has also said that violence targeting federal authorities and property in Illinois in recent weeks constitutes a \"rebellion or danger of rebellion.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had threatened for weeks to mobilize the National Guard within Illinois amid confrontations outside a processing facility for immigrant detainees in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago. Then, in early October, the president said the situation in Chicago had become dangerous for federal agencies, and exercised his authority to call members of the Illinois National Guard into federal service.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker denounced the move and called it \"un-American to demand a governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.\"",
      "Pritzker wrote Friday on X that Illinois \"will keep defending the sovereignty of our state.\"",
      "The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sued over the federalization of National Guard members, arguing that the directives are unlawful. The Trump administration has argued that courts cannot review the president's move.",
      "U.S. District Judge April Perry sided with the state earlier this month, finding that the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of the events in Chicago to be \"unreliable.\"",
      "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit then issued a preliminary order temporarily blocking the deployment of Guard troops in Illinois, but said they could remain under federal control. In its decision Thursday, a unanimous panel of judges maintained that posture, finding \"the facts do not justify\" Mr. Trump's actions in Illinois.",
      "\"The spirited, sustained, and occasionally violent actions of demonstrators in protest of the federal government's immigration policies and actions, without more, does not give rise to a danger of rebellion against the government's authority,\" the judges wrote in an unsigned ruling.",
      "They also noted that federal facilities, including the processing center in Broadview, have remained open amid the protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies, and said disruptions have been contained by local, state and federal authorities.",
      "Clashes over the president's immigration policies have led the president to federalize and deploy members of the National Guard to the Los Angeles area, Portland and\u00a0Memphis. A federal appeals court\u00a0allowed Mr. Trump to deploy roughly 4,000 of California's National Guard to Los Angeles and is weighing a bid to allow the mobilization of troops to Portland.",
      "Mr. Trump has also sent National Guard troops to the streets of Washington, D.C., and has threatened to deploy members to cities including Baltimore and San Francisco."

    "story": [
      "Benjamin Leon Jr. hustled to a White House security checkpoint Wednesday night. He was running late for a dinner recognizing financial backers of President Trump's new ballroom construction project.",
      "Secret Service officers waved Leon and his wife through.",
      "Once inside, Leon, a wealthy Florida businessman and Mr. Trump's nominee for ambassador to Spain, joined an exclusive guest list of about 130 that included Nvidia's Ned Finkle, Extremity Care's Oliver Burckhardt, Boxabl's Paolo Tiramani and Galiano Tiramani and Coinbase's Kara Calvert.",
      "Representatives from companies that gave major contributions to the ballroom were on the list, including OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and Apple executive Nick Ammann, sources told CBS News.",
      "Some guests arrived in black SUVs with a security team. After a meal of tomato salad, Beef Wellington, and butterscotch ice cream with a pear jam-filled meringue, donors \"mobbed\" Mr. Trump, seeking a quick conversation or a cellphone photo, attendees told CBS News after the event.",
      "Several, including Leon, declined to share how much they'd donated, and the White House won't say either.",
      "But Mr. Trump says his $250 million ballroom is fully financed \u2014 and that leftover money could be directed toward his next architectural endeavor: an arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial.",
      "Mr. Trump has taken literally the task of building his legacy, ordering up construction projects that are likely to long outlast his presidency. He's already overhauled the Rose Garden (twice) and recently redid a room off the West Wing.",
      "Democrats would like some guardrails around the ballroom \u2014 even if they're powerless to stop its construction.",
      "California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, is introducing two ballroom-inspired bills Friday. One would ban donor names from being displayed on White House structures or grounds unless the House speaker, minority leader and White House approve it.",
      "CBS News reported in September that ballroom fundraisers had discussed etching donors' names in stone or brick in the structure.",
      "\"This is the White House \u2014 it's an emblem of our nation,\" Takano told CBS News. \"It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace.\"",
      "Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction.",
      "Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message.",
      "The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from \"his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care,\" Takano said.",
      "Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. \"For me, it's like \u2013 I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with.\"",
      "Construction crews are at work on the ballroom, with heavy machinery rumbling around the White House's east side. A John Deere excavator could be seen swinging its arm.",
      "Aside from financial donations, companies have also made in-kind contributions. Carrier is donating a \"world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come,\" according to a company statement.",
      "An unnamed firm committed $37 million in steel, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The ballroom, with bulletproof glass windows, will hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650 in July, Mr. Trump said. The footprint has \"definitely expanded,\" and its exact square footage is \"not yet settled,\" according to a source familiar with the layout.",
      "It was originally 90,000 square feet. That figure is likely to increase.",
      "The White House shared an abbreviated list of those invited to the dinner, but declined to disclose how much each person or company has given.",
      "CBS News obtained a full list of dinner guests.",
      "The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee confirmed earlier this month a probe of the ballroom's financing had commenced. \"We need to know who is involved. Are foreign governments paying for any of this?\" Rep. Robert Garcia told Meidastouch Network.",
      "The investigation is in a preliminary phase. In addition to exploring foreign donations, committee Democrats plan to scrutinize construction contracts, settlement money directed to the cause and whether donations lead to favors from government officials.",
      "Ballroom donations are being collected by the Trust for the National Mall, a charitable non-profit organization that partners with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trust told CBS News the White House and National Park Service are responsible for construction and design. So far, the Trust has received no foreign donations for the ballroom, the spokesperson said.",
      "According to a pledge form obtained by CBS News, the Trust takes a 2.5% cut on each donation, a routine administrative fee in the fundraising world. The Trust stands to collect more than $6 million in fees on $250 million raised. The Trust spokesperson declined to offer specifics on the fee arrangement.",
      "The Trust recently took in $22 million from a settlement agreement between YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Trump. The civil lawsuit stemmed from YouTube deplatforming Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.",
      "At the dinner Wednesday, Mr. Trump held up three mock-ups of his next project, an arch on the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, across from the Lincoln Memorial.",
      "In 1902, the National Park Service considered building a triumphal arch on that site to honor President and Union General Ulysses S. Grant, but the arch was never built. Perhaps this time will be different.",
      "\"Small, medium and large,\" Mr. Trump said, gesturing to the miniature models, which resembled Paris' Arc de Triomphe. \"I happen to think the large looks by far the best.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 16:41:40 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News has had an office in the Pentagon for decades, where it has covered every conflict since World War II, as well as the stories of the U.S. military's service members.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time in more than 60 years, CBS News will close out the week without a workspace in the Pentagon after declining \u2014 along with nearly every major news organization \u2014 to sign onto new press requirements that reporters' associations say could infringe on their First Amendment rights.",
      "During D-Day, CBS News radio correspondent Joseph F. McCaffrey reported live from the Pentagon about the strategy and General Dwight D. Eisenhower's background.",
      "\"Most of the plotting, the working, the split-haired timing was done in this building,\" McCaffrey reported on June 6, 1944. \"Although only a chosen few knew when the day would arrive, the atmosphere here in the Pentagon building has been tense for several weeks.\" Listen to the audio here.",
      "CBS News had radio correspondents in the building since the 1940s and a TV network booth, or mini-office, in an area designated for media since the 1970s. Over the past two decades, as the networks have been able to go live from the building, \"on-air\" lights flash on when major news breaks, and journalists relay information to the public live from the Pentagon.",
      "For most of that time, CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin was the one breaking the news and reporting out every story. The Pentagon gave him his first press badge in 1983, his longtime producer Mary Walsh 10 years later. Since then, the duo has not only covered every military conflict, but also told stories about the military's service members and their lives.",
      "\"I'm proud of the work David Martin and I have done, telling stories of valor on the battlefield and courage and resilience at Walter Reed,\" Walsh wrote in an email before turning in her Pentagon press credential this week. \"I have been inspired and humbled by the fortitude of these men and women, their willingness to sacrifice everything for our country.\"",
      "Many of those stories emerged from relationships built because of CBS News' constant presence inside the Pentagon.",
      "\"Walking the halls of the Pentagon was my M.O. for 40 years. I don't know how else to cover a story except by being there,\" Martin wrote in an email. \"I would guess that 90 per cent of the stories I broke were a result of being in the hallways and visiting officials in their offices.\"",
      "\"Not every official was glad to see me but dealing with them face to face, day in and day out, developed a level of trust on both sides. Sometimes relationships got tense but never acrimonious,\" Martin wrote. \"Even when [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs] Colin Powell was yelling at me to get the hell out of his way, I knew I could go back and talk to him the next day.\"",
      "Martin's first day on the job as CBS News Pentagon correspondent was April 18, 1983, the day a previously unknown terrorist group called Hezbollah blew up the American embassy in Beirut.",
      "\"Nobody knew it at the time, but that was the start of the age of terror,\" Martin said.",
      "\"The next 40 years included the invasion of Grenada, Panama, the First Gulf War, the air war against Serbia, 9/11, the invasion of first Afghanistan and then Iraq, the Bin Laden raid and the withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2014 not to mention all the cultural issues, like women in combat. I cannot imagine covering any of those stories without a building pass,\" Martin wrote.",
      "Bob Schieffer, the moderator of \"Face the Nation\" from 1991-2015, spent some of his first years at CBS News wearing a Pentagon pass.",
      "\"I came to work for CBS in 1969, and it was shortly after that, they just sent me out to the Pentagon because I was the rookie,\" Schieffer said in a phone interview.",
      "Schieffer was there for about six years and \"loved it.\"",
      "\"I'll tell you what I loved about it \u2014 it was like covering a small town in the middle of a big city,\" Schieffer said. \"You could get information, and you know, most of the time, it was information that not only helped you, it helped the public understand.\"",
      "\"They spend a lot of money at the Pentagon and rightly so, but I think people have a right to know about it, and not just get one public relations person who's going to put out a press release.\"",
      "Currently, Charlie D'Agata is CBS News' senior national security correspondent covering the Pentagon and brings over two decades of experience covering the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the U.S. military involvement in war zones from Iraq and Afghanistan to Syria.",
      "But it's not just the correspondents on camera who are giving up their passes.",
      "CBS News radio correspondent Cami McCormick has covered national security at CBS for over two decades. And teams of producers, camera operators, audio technicians and engineers crucial to bringing stories of the military to Americans across the country will also be turning in their passes.",
      "The Pentagon says the intent of its new policy is to stop press leaks and exercise control over stories about the military reported by CBS News and other media organizations. It sent journalists a memo in September mandating they sign an agreement acknowledging they would need formal authorization to publish either classified or controlled unclassified information.",
      "The department said in the memo that \"information must be approved before public release \u2026 even if it is unclassified.\" News organizations were given a deadline of 5 p.m. this past Tuesday to return the signed agreement. The vast majority declined to do so, though at least one outlet, the far-right One America News Network, agreed to the new restrictions.",
      "CBS News Pentagon journalists may have turned in their credentials this week, but losing access to the building isn't going to stop them from reporting what's going on in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth once promised would be \"the most transparent administration ever.\"",

    "summary": "Russell Vought said the Army Corps of Engineers is pausing more than $11 billion in \"lower-priority projects,\" including in New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The head of the White House Office of Management and Budget said Friday that the Trump administration will be pausing more than $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects, including in four Democratic-led cities, continuing its efforts to increase pressure on Democrats as the government shutdown is poised to extend into another week.",
      "\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects. The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore,\" Russ Vought, director of the budget office, wrote on X.",
      "He said additional information would come from the Army Corps of Engineers. It's unclear whether the \"lower-priority projects\" being paused include others beyond those in New York, San Francisco, Baltimore and Boston, which are all located in states represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has been targeting federal dollars going to projects in Democratic-led cities and states since the early days of the shutdown, which entered its 17th day on Friday and is set to continue into next week. The Trump administration has so far\u00a0frozen roughly $18 billion for a pair of infrastructure projects in New York City,\u00a0canceled $8 billion for climate-related efforts in 16 states and withheld $2.1 billion for infrastructure projects in Chicago. All of the states that would benefit from the funds are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has also overseen a plan to lay off thousands of federal workers amid the ongoing shutdown. Federal agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices last week, and Vought estimated that the number of government employees impacted could exceed 10,000.",
      "A federal judge, however, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with the job cuts, saying during a hearing in San Francisco that they appeared to be politically motivated.",
      "The Trump administration's moves appear aimed at ramping up the pressure on Democratic lawmakers to support a GOP-backed stopgap funding measure. Democrats have resisted backing the plan, which passed the House last month, and are instead pushing for an extension of enhanced health care tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. They also want to undo cuts to Medicaid that were part of Mr. Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" passed earlier this year.",
      "Democrats have so far been unmoved by the pressure by the Trump administration, with a 10th vote in the Senate to resolve the logjam failing on Thursday."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 15:06:06 -0400",
    "summary": "John Bolton was indicted on 18 counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified information.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014John Bolton, who served as national security adviser to President Trump in his first term, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified information shared with two relatives in \"diary-like entries\" across a seven-year span.",
      "Bolton appeared at the federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, where he was expected to be processed in the criminal case. He made an initial appearance before a magistrate judge after a federal grand jury handed up an 18-count indictment against him Thursday. Bolton was released on his own recognizance, promising to appear in court as required and surrender to serve any sentence that may be imposed.",
      "He was required to turn over his passport and is restricted from traveling outside the continental U.S. without permission from the court, according to an\u00a0order setting the conditions of his release. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama, will oversee the criminal case against Bolton.",
      "Bolton, who has held a variety of senior positions within the U.S. government since the 1980s, is the third prominent critic of Mr. Trump's to face criminal charges in recent weeks. Grand juries in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted former FBI Director James Comey late last month for allegedly lying to Congress, and New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged bank fraud. Comey pleaded not guilty to the two charges brought against him, and James has called the claims against her \"baseless.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that from 2018 to August 2025, Bolton shared with two unnamed relatives more than 1,000 pages of information about his day-to-day activities while serving as national security adviser to Mr. Trump, some of which was classified. The indictment also claims that Bolton kept documents, writings and notes related to the national defense, including information that was classified, in his home in Montgomery County, Maryland.",
      "Bolton faces eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
      "In a statement following the indictment, Bolton said Mr. Trump has been working to punish him since he left his post as national security adviser in 2019, during the president's first term in the White House.",
      "\"Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,\" Bolton said.",
      "He said the charges brought against him \"are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, Bolton's lawyer, denied that his client committed wrongdoing.",
      "\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career \u2014 records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries \u2014 that is not a crime.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that Bolton's \"diary-like\" notes were typed transcriptions of handwritten notes that were then sent to two unnamed relatives through a commercial non-governmental messaging app. They said Bolton also used personal email accounts, like those from AOL and Google, to email classified information to the relatives at their own accounts.",
      "The indictment alleges that the entries included sensitive information up to the top secret and sensitive compartmented information level, a designation that means it was derived from sensitive intelligence sources. The notes contained \"detailed information that Bolton learned from meetings with senior members of the U.S. Government, intelligence briefings from members of the intelligence community and military, discussions with foreign leaders and foreign intelligence and military organizations, and intelligence products and reports,\" according to the document.",
      "Bolton is also accused of printing out and storing the notes at his Maryland home and keeping digital copies on personal devices. The FBI conducted a search of Bolton's house and Washington, D.C., office in August and seized electronic files showing the diary entries had been transmitted to the two relatives, according to the indictment. Investigators also found hard-copy printed versions of Bolton's diary entries during the search, it said.",
      "Prosecutors said that at some point between 2019 and 2021, after he left the White House, Bolton's email account was hacked by a \"cyber actor,\" believed to associated with Iran, which gained \"unauthorized access \" to the classified and national defense information housed within the account.",
      "A representative for Bolton notified the U.S. government of the hack in July 2021, but didn't disclose that it contained sensitive information, according to the indictment. Prosecutors said that Bolton received an email around July 2021 that read: \"I do not think you would be interested in the FBI being aware of the leaked content of John's email (some of which have been attached), especially after the recent acquittal. This could be the biggest scandal since Hillary's emails were leaked, but this time on the GOP side! Contact me before it's too late ...\"",
      "The FBI was informed of the message.",
      "The indictment against Bolton includes much more detail than those involving Comey and James, and the charges were brought by a different U.S. attorney's office than the one pursuing those other two cases. Still, Bolton \u2014 like Comey and James \u2014 has been frequent target of Mr. Trump since he left this post as national security adviser.",
      "Soon after the president returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump ended Bolton's U.S. Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted protection by the Biden administration in 2021 following a series of threats from Iran related to the 2020 killing of General Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday after Bolton was indicted that he's a \"bad guy.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\""

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with President Trump at the White House today.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to press President Trump not only for long range Tomahawk missiles and upgraded air defense capabilities, but also for increased intelligence sharing to help his forces inflict more damage on Russia's energy sector.",
      "A Ukrainian and a U.S. lawmaker told CBS News that Kyiv wants to purchase equipment to upgrade its existing weapons systems, including for the F-16 jets it already possesses. On Thursday, Zelenskyy also met with executives from defense firm Lockheed Martin about the F-16 aircraft, as well as missiles. He also met with Raytheon, which makes Patriot missile systems, about potential joint manufacturing.",
      "Energy supply is the less conventional weapon to be discussed Friday, and it's a key interest for Mr. Trump. CBS News confirmed the U.S. has been aiding Ukraine through intelligence support in its efforts to hit Russian energy supplies, according to sources familiar with the U.S. efforts. Energy is the main source of income for Moscow's war chest.",
      "Ahead of the cold winter months, Ukraine and Russia have been targeting each other's energy sector to deprive \u2014 or at least make more costly \u2014 the supply of heat and electricity. The Ukrainian government says that Russia has attacked the infrastructure at Naftogaz, the largest gas and oil company in Ukraine, six times this month as part of its campaign.",
      "During his Washington visit this week, Zelenskyy had meetings with U.S. energy company executives that he said had been proposed by President Trump himself. He posted on social media videos of discussions with those executives and can be heard speaking in English about liquified natural gas terminals.",
      "Zelenskyy also met with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and said that they discussed the Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy and the need to restore the facilities that were damaged in the attacks.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report on Oct. 1 that Mr. Trump had recently signed off on allowing U.S. intelligence and the Pentagon to aid Kyiv with strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Last week, the Financial Times reported that U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv had indeed already enabled strikes on important Russian energy assets far beyond the frontline.",
      "That targeting indicates a more aggressive posture by the Trump administration than its rhetoric would indicate.",
      "Asked about the Financial Times' reporting, House Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the Ukrainian attacks on refineries had reduced Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other products by almost 20%.",
      "Himes, a member of the Gang of 8, the congressional leaders who are privy to sensitive classified information, said that despite Trump's often friendly rhetoric toward Russia, his actions had not necessarily matched up.",
      "\"His rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "Energy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy, who confirmed that 20% damage figure to CBS News, tallied at least 18 Russian refineries that have been hit by at least one Ukrainian drone strike, affecting nearly half of Russian distillation capacity. This has reduced Russia's ability to export refined products and has contributed to gasoline shortages within Russia.",
      "The pain is clearly being felt by Moscow. On Sept. 30, the Russian government also announced an extension of its temporary ban on gasoline exports through the end of the year. Diesel, marine fuel and other gas oils were also banned.",
      "Mr. Trump has been mulling whether to provide long-range weapons like Tomahawks to Ukraine, which is a step former President Joe Biden did not take. Both presidents have had concerns that strikes deep inside Russian territory that are facilitated by U.S. equipment would be perceived as escalatory and trigger a Russian response that could potentially draw in the U.S. or other NATO members.",
      "Trump indicated to reporters on Thursday that he may not provide Tomahawks: \"We have a lot of them, but we need them. I mean, we can't deplete for our country. So, you know, they're very vital, they're very powerful. They're very accurate, they're very good, but we need them too.\"",
      "In the meantime, Ukraine's own offensive drone technology has rapidly developed, enabling it to strike targets well inside the Russian territorial borders. Some of the hits on energy installations have been carried out by drones, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "A lawmaker familiar with developing Ukraine policy told CBS News that Ukraine's offensive drone technology is a potential game changer. Ukraine does not need U.S. permission to use\u00a0 drones it has produced to strike Russia, but it does need U.S. permission to strike into Russia with U.S.-provided weapons. The Trump administration's decision to provide long-range targeting intelligence would allow for increased effectiveness of the Ukrainian drones, which would make it less vital for the U.S. to provide weapons for the same purpose.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that it is finally time to move in the next 30 days on the secondary sanctions bill that would further reduce Russia's ability to sell oil to buyers like India, China, and others. The bill has overwhelming bipartisan support, and a veto-proof majority, so, if it makes it to Mr. Trump's desk, he would have to sign it into law.",
      "There is also a second bill Congress being considered in the coming days that would designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for the crime of kidnapping of Ukrainian children, which could trigger further financial penalties. Republican Senators Katie Britt and Lindsay Graham as well as Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Dick Blumenthal are co-sponsoring the measure.",
      "Last week, first lady Melania Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally responded to her advocacy on behalf of Ukrainian children by promising to discuss future releases of children. Yale University investigators estimate that at least 35,000 Ukrainian children have been taken into Russia, and the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, given his direct role in the scheme.",
      "The Trump administration is hoping that the increased economic and military pressure will jumpstart the stalled diplomatic track. On Thursday, President Trump said he expected to meet again soon with Putin, perhaps in Budapest, Hungary.",
      "Ukraine remains skeptical of Putin's intentions. Ukraine's new ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, said that the massive overnight missile strike by Russia hours before Presidents Putin and Trump spoke by phone Thursday exposes \"Moscow's real attitude toward peace.\""

      "A federal judge has lifted travel restrictions for Mahmoud Khalil, allowing the Palestinian activist to speak at rallies and other events across the U.S. as he fights his deportation case brought by the Trump administration.",
      "Khalil, who was freed from a Louisiana immigration jail in June after missing the birth of his first child, had asked a federal magistrate judge to lift the restrictions that limited his travel to New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Louisiana and Michigan.",
      "\"He wants to travel for the very significant First Amendment reasons that are at the bottom of this case,\" his lawyer, Alina Das, said during a virtual hearing Thursday. \"He wants to speak to issues of public concern.\"",
      "An attorney for the government, Aniello DeSimone, opposed the move, arguing that Khalil \"has not provided enough of a reason why he couldn't attend these and other events telephonically.\"",
      "The magistrate judge, Michael Hammer, agreed Thursday to allow Khalil to travel, noting he is not considered a flight risk and had not violated any of his release conditions.",
      "Hammer granted the government's request that Khalil, a green card holder, alert U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about his travel plans ahead of time.",
      "An immigration judge in Louisiana ruled last month that Khalil \u2014 a former graduate student at Columbia University in New York \u2014 could be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application. His attorneys are currently challenging that decision.",
      "The government has\u00a0accused Khalil\u00a0of leaving out details on his immigration paperwork about his past associations, including membership in a United Nations agency that works with Palestinians and his \"continuing employment\" at the British Embassy in Lebanon. Khalil has denied making misrepresentations and said he was not a member of the U.N. agency but instead an unpaid intern through Columbia. He also stated he stopped working at the British Embassy in Beirut in 2022.",
      "Khalil, who was a prominent figure at protests against the war in Gaza at Columbia, was arrested by ICE agents on March 8, becoming the first campus activist swept up in President Trump's crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists. Khalil is one of several international students who were detained due to their links to pro-Palestinian campus activism, which the Trump administration alleges is riddled with antisemitism \u2014 a charge the protesters deny.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin previously said in a statement to CBS News: \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, take over buildings and deface property, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.\"",
      "Khalil has\u00a0denied\u00a0advocating for violence or engaging in antisemitic speech during campus protests at the university, saying in\u00a0court papers\u00a0he is \"committed to peaceful protest.\""

    "story": [
      "Powerful members of the Democratic National Committee will soon decide how states will be chosen to be among the first to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries, moving the party closer to one of the most important decisions it will make in the coming years.",
      "CBS News has learned that at a meeting later this month, the party's influential rules and bylaws panel will focus on the application process to be among the first handful of states to hold a Democratic presidential nominating contest.",
      "Earning one of these prized slots is likely to bring about outsized power in the political process. With that influence comes major attention from candidates, a potential economic boost and the chance to play a role in how Democrats message and campaign on major topics and issues as the party tries to find a path forward after stinging losses in last year's presidential election.",
      "A source familiar with the calendar efforts detailed the materials written by the co-chairs of the party's rules and bylaws panel, including a draft resolution and request for proposal, were shared Friday with members. At the late October meeting, members will have a chance to revise and vote on the work.",
      "The resolution outlines standards, which according to the source, cover the following:",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;\u00a0Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;\u00a0Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",

      "Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;",
      "Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "The plans call for four or five states to be chosen by DNC members to hold a nominating contest in what's known as the \"early window,\" which comes before states begin voting in large numbers on Super Tuesday and the weeks afterwards. Under the draft, each of the four regions being focused on by the DNC, the East, Midwest, South and West, would need to have at least one state from its respective areas be chosen.",
      "The work comes after Democrats overhauled the early voting calendar during Joe Biden's time as president, jettisoning the Iowa caucuses from being the first state to have its say on a presidential nominee. Party leaders followed Biden's push to instead install South Carolina, whose primary revived his 2020 presidential primary campaign, in the top voting spot instead.",
      "New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden had struggled to a fifthplace primary finish in 2020, was given the chance to remain an early voting state but was moved down to sharing its primary day with Nevada. The general election presidential battleground states of Georgia and Michigan were selected to round out the list.",
      "The perceived pushback against New Hampshire was derided by Democrats from the state, who have a tradition of intensely defending its first-in-the-nation primary status and have a state law to help it try and do so.",
      "In early 2024, the state held a primary outside of the DNC process before South Carolina voted, resulting in Mr. Biden's not filing in New Hampshire's contest. Allies, however, rallied behind a robust write-in campaign for him in New Hampshire. Mr. Biden easily won without his name even being on the ballot, which calmed tensions between first-in-the-nation advocates and Biden supporters.",
      "Any state can apply for the early window slots. While South Carolina was the first DNC approved primary last year, it's not certain it will be picked to start the calendar again. While the southern state is reliably red in general elections, Mr. Biden's view, as shared in a 2022 letter, invoked South Carolina's diversity when he urged DNC members to \"ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window.\"",
      "New Hampshire is expected to try to regain its place as the first 2028 DNC primary state with a pitch that can be made about the state's tradition, small size, voter engagement and ability for unexpected candidates to succeed. Democrats in Nevada however are also already making a case that the presidential battleground state out West should go first instead.",
      "In an August memo, Nevada State Democratic Party Executive Director Hilary Barrett argued that \"elevating a union-strong, diverse, highly competitive battleground state will lay the groundwork to help Democrats win back working-class voters and voters of color. If we fail to rebuild that coalition, we won't win back the White House.\"",
      "There's potential that Michigan, a state crucial to Democrats' chances of winning the presidency, could rise to the top slot, given the party's hope that early primary attention and investments may help a Democratic presidential candidate carry the state's electoral votes in 2028."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. government is probing the social media of those applying for legal immigration benefits as part of a Trump administration push to root out \"anti-American\" activity and views that are \"beyond the pale,\" a top immigration official told CBS News.",
      "Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency in charge of the legal immigration system, said the vetting effort primarily relies on what he called the \"social media screening\" of people applying for green cards and other immigration applications.",
      "In August, the Trump administration issued a directive instructing USCIS officials to consider the identification of \"anti-American\" views and activity of certain applicants for immigration benefits as an \"overwhelmingly negative factor\" that could justify denial.",
      "Asked what types of views and activities could be found to be \"anti-American\" by his agency, Edlow cited \"what we've seen college campuses to have allowed over the last several years.\"",
      "\"There has been such a large-scale espousing of foreign terrorist ideology, whether it's Hamas or another organization that has been matched with \u2026 a clear desire by these elements to trample on the rights of other people around them,\" Edlow told CBS News during an interview at USCIS headquarters in Maryland.",
      "Pressed on whether those determinations could be based on speech protected by the U.S. Constitution, Edlow said, \"Absolutely not.\"",
      "\"People are free to make whatever statements they want on social media or anywhere else. And anyone who, you know, doesn't support the same candidate that I support. That is not what we're talking about,\" he said.",
      "\"We are talking about beyond the pale,\" Edlow added. \"We are talking about people who are actively supporting the violent overthrow of this country, or otherwise are providing material support to terrorist organizations across the world.\"",
      "Edlow said the probe into \"anti-American\" views and activities would not be the sole criteria for granting or denying applications.",
      "\"It's not the deciding factor. It's not the only factor, but it is one factor that we want to make sure that we fully understand,\" he said.",
      "Critics of the Trump administration have accused it of weaponizing U.S. immigration law to punish noncitizens for their legally protected speech.",
      "Federal courts have questioned the legality of the administration's effort to deport legal residents like Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who participated in protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza. The administration has claimed Khalil and other activists undermined U.S. foreign policy and fostered antisemitism. But those targeted and their allies have argued the government is simply penalizing them for exercising their First Amendment rights.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department announced that officials had revoked the visas of several foreign nationals who it said \"celebrated\" the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV\"",
      "Unlike its sister agencies Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, processing immigration benefits has long been the core function of USCIS.",
      "But under the second Trump administration, USCIS has placed a greater emphasis on combating immigration fraud, aggressively vetting applicants and working more closely with ICE, including to facilitate arrests at its offices across the country. This summer, the agency also announced it would hire and train its own team of armed special agents, who Edlow said are not yet on the job.",
      "The citizenship process alone has been tweaked several times by the Trump administration, which has added more questions to the civics test used to quiz applicants on U.S. history and politics, and expanded inquiries into whether applicants have \"good moral character.\"",
      "It has also restarted a long-dormant practice, known as \"neighborhood checks,\" which involves sending investigators to interview the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants. Edlow said those checks will not apply to every case due to resource constraints.",
      "Immigrant advocates argue the changes are unfairly scaring legal immigrants. But Edlow said USCIS is \"moving back to where it was supposed to be at the beginning,\" arguing that it had effectively become \"a rubber-stamping agency\" under the Biden administration. He said vetting has always been a core function of USCIS since its creation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
      "\"We are not here as a police force,\" he said. \"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns that right now create much confusion and many problems within the legal immigration system.\"",
      "Edlow argued the effort would ultimately make it easier for people to immigrate to the U.S. legally.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV \u2026 of this government,\" Edlow added. \"We want to be faster. We want to be leaner.\"",
      "No decision yet on DACA's future",
      "One of the most well-known programs administered by USCIS is the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which currently protects half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" from deportation and allows them to work in the U.S. legally. They are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas.",

      "\"Back then, you could have a simple question, but you couldn't get an easy answer,\" Tyson said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday. \"Now, you can type anything into Google, into ChatGPT. If you have ever seen those replies that come in from AI, it's got no soul. It's got no personality.\"",
      "He says the questions he gets today are more playful and imaginative.",
      "\"People are now asking questions that are a little more fun, rather than, 'How hot is the sun?' Stuff you can just look up.\"",
      "One example he highlights: \"If aliens came and exploded the moon, what effect would that have on us?\"",

      "On the topic of aliens, Tyson is clear about the science and the skepticism.",

    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

The group published a study on the new finding in the October issue of its scientific journal, the\u00a0Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",
      "While ORCs detected in the past looked like one bright circle, this one consisted of two intersecting rings, which is rare. Previously, research into ORCs suggested the rings could be caused by shockwaves that were triggered by the merging of supermassive black holes or galaxies, but the latest findings propose that they actually could be linked to \"superwind\" flowing out of their host galaxies, the Royal Astronomical Society said.",

      "The magnetic field surrounding Earth protects the planet from cosmic radiation and particles charged by the sun. Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.",
      "The weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.",
      "The ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.",
      "The satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",
      "The satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.",
      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",

      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch.

      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instagram-meta-restrictions-teen-accounts-pg-13/",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 20:16:57 -0400",
    "summary": "The new restrictions for teen users are gradually rolling out starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, Meta said.",
    "story": [
      "Instagram-parent Meta announced Tuesday that teen users will now see content on Instagram that's similar to what they might see while watching a film with a PG-13 rating.",
      "That's because new content settings for Instagram users under 18 will adhere to the same regulations. The new automatic protections are being rolled by the company starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, according to Meta.",
      "\"We hope this update reassures parents that we're working to show teens safe, age-appropriate content on Instagram by default, while also giving them more ways to shape their teen's experience,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "PG-13, a rating used in the media industry, indicates that parental guidance is suggested when watching content, particularly for children under 13.",
      "What are the new restrictions?",
      "The accounts of Instagram users under 18 will now be automatically be placed under a 13+ setting. Opting out of the setting will require parental permission.",
      "Teens with the setting will be blocked from seeing search results for terms like \"alcohol\" or \"gore.\" This adds to list of search topics from which Meta said it already shields teens, such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.",
      "Teens will also be prevented from following accounts that regularly posts content deemed age-inappropriate. Instagram users under 18 who already follow such accounts, will no longer be able to see or interact with their content, send them DMs, or see their comments under anyone's posts.",
      "Meta is also applying the new regulations to its artificial intelligence technology which is integrated into Instagram to help answer users' questions. \"A.I.s should not give age-inappropriate responses that would feel out of place in a PG-13 movie,\" Meta said Tuesday.",
      "The social media company is also unveiling a separate setting for parents who prefer a \"more restrictive experience for their teen.\" That setting, called \"Limited Content,\" filters more content out from teens' feeds while also restricting their ability to see, leave or receive comments on posts.",
      "Meta introduced \"Teen Accounts\" last year, billing the move as a way to protect the safety of its younger user base. The company's new teen restrictions follow similar announcements by\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and\u00a0OpenAI."

      "The popular online gaming platform Roblox, which hosts millions of user-created games, is being sued by families and state attorneys general who claim online predators can groom, extort and exploit kids they meet on the platform.",
      "Steven, a father of two, is among those who have filed lawsuits as his family tries to rebuild their life after his son was allegedly targeted.",
      "He said that allowing his teen son to play Roblox seemed like a safe bet \u2014 at first.",
      "\"I set up every parental control I could find and did the best I could,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview, asking that CBS News only use his first name for privacy reasons.",
      "But despite the platform's parental controls, an alleged sex offender posing as a 16-year-old befriended his 13-year-old son in the popular \"Pet Simulator\" game, according to the lawsuit. Steven alleged the predator offered his son Roblox gift cards in exchange for sexually explicit photos, which his son sent via Discord \u2013 a separate gaming and chat platform.",
      "\"At a certain point it was, 'tell me what your address is' and when he said no, he's like, 'Well, I have these photos of you, I'll tell your parents,'\" Steven said of the interaction between the predator and his son back in July 2024. \"He was 30 feet down the hall from us and just\u2014 felt too trapped to \u2026 come and talk to us.\"",
      "It was \"pure luck,\" Steven said, that he found out \u2014 because of a threatening message from the perpetrator that allegedly popped up as he was replacing the screen on his son's phone, which had cracked.",

      "Lawsuits against Roblox, Discord",
      "Steven's family is among dozens of families, as well as attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, who are suing Roblox and other tech platforms, alleging they allowed sexual predators access to their children.",
      "Kentucky announced a lawsuit against Roblox last month, and Louisiana filed a suit against the platform in August.",
      "\"For years, Roblox has ignored this crisis so it could continue turning a profit,\" Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement. \"Our responsibility is to protect Kentucky children from online exploitation by these predators and the companies like Roblox that knowingly facilitate it.\"",
      "Steven said his family is suing Roblox as well as Discord, an instant messaging and social platform, because \"at the end of the day, the thing they seem to care about the most is the bottom line, their profit.\"",
      "\"It almost feels like they're a haven for \u2026 predators, pedophiles, dangerous individuals and like they should do better,\" he said.",
      "Steven's attorney Alexandra Walsh, with the firm Anapol Weiss, is currently investigating hundreds of cases of child endangerment and grooming that allegedly started on Roblox.",
      "\"Roblox was the gateway. Roblox is the site that ... in this case that gave this predator, this very dangerous man, the ability to find a target and groom this child,\" Walsh said.",
      "Steven has moved his family across the country to have a new start as he supports his son through depression and PTSD, he said.",
      "\"This thing happens so much faster than you can ever imagine,\" Steven said. \"You want to believe that like \u2026 you've done everything you can and that it'll never happen to me and I thought the same thing until it did.\"",
      "Roblox and Discord respond",
      "Matt Kaufman, the chief safety officer at Roblox, said the platform does not allow image sharing in filtered chats and has rolled out over 100 new safety features this year, including age estimation and increased chat monitoring.",
      "\"We have safety systems that are in place by default and a lot of these situations that you're talking about, like extortion, people sharing, graphic images, they simply cannot happen on Roblox,\" Kaufman said.",
      "Until recently, Roblox did not verify players' ages. By the end of the year, all users will have to pass its checks to communicate within the platform. According to Roblox, these checks will include \"a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification and verified parental consent.\"",
      "Currently, any communication between adult users and those between 13 and 17 is prohibited, unless a real life confirmed relationship can be proven.",
      "\"For users 13 to 17 who confirm their age through Facial Age Estimation, adding a Trusted Connection, whether a peer or an 18 or older user, requires an existing real-world relationship, verified by a QR scan or Contact Importer,\" Roblox says on its site.",
      "Roblox's chief safety officer  Kaufman said the company has caught and self-reported 23,000 incidents of\u00a0potentially harmful content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children so far this year.",
      "\"What's really important about these cases that we report is: we report when we see signs of something that doesn't look safe,\" Kaufman said. \"Any platform of our size \u2026 it draws bad actors and our job is to do the best that we possibly can to prevent anything from happening on our platform and to report those situations as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Discord told CBS News it won't comment on pending litigation, but said in a statement that it is \"deeply committed to safety,\" and works to \"prevent the spread of sexual exploitation and grooming.\""

      "Crowds hit the streets Saturday in cities and towns across the country to vent their anger over President Trump's policies in \"No Kings\" protests, which Republicans have slammed as \"Hate America\" rallies.",
      "People carrying signs with slogans such as \"Nothing is more patriotic than protesting\" or \"Resist Fascism\" packed into New York City's Times Square and rallied by the thousands in parks in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. Demonstrators marched through Washington and downtown Los Angeles and picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states, a courthouse in Billings, Montana, and at hundreds of smaller public spaces.",
      "Mr. Trump's Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as \"Hate America\" rallies, but in many places the events looked more like a street party. There were marching bands, huge banners with the U.S. Constitution's \"We The People\" preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon.",
      "More than 2,700 demonstrations were planned coast to coast, with at least one in every state and even near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where he is spending the weekend.",
      "Organizers said the nationwide rally drew more people than similar events on June 14, which was Mr. Trump's birthday and the day of a giant\u00a0military parade in the U.S. capital, the No Kings Coalition said in a news release.",
      "\"The millions of people protesting are centered around a fierce love for our country. A country that we believe is worth fighting for,\" said Katie Bethell, the executive director of MoveOn, an advocacy group that's part of the larger coalition.",
      "Protestors said they were outraged over the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants and its deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.",
      "Since then, Mr. Trump \u2014 who returned to the White House in January \u2014 has ordered National Guard troops into Washington, D.C. and Memphis. Planned deployments to Chicago and Portland\u00a0have so far been blocked in the courts.",
      "Demonstrators are also upset over Mr. Trump's attacks on the media, prosecutions of his political opponents and a host of other actions they see as authoritarian.",
      "On its website, \"No Kings\" organizers say, \"The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don't have kings and we won't back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty.\"",
      "\"This president is a disgrace and I hope there will be millions in the street today,\" Stephanie, a 36-year-old hospital worker who did not give her last name, told AFP in the Queens borough of New York, where hundreds had already gathered in the morning.",
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered in Portland for a peaceful demonstration downtown. Later in the day, tensions grew as a few hundred protesters and counterprotesters showed up at a U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement building, with federal agents at times firing tear gas to disperse the crowd and city police threatening to make arrests if demonstrators blocked streets.",
      "The building has been the site of mostly small nightly protests since June \u2014 the reason the Trump administration has cited for trying to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, which a federal judge has at least temporarily blocked.",
      "More than 10,000 people showed up at Lafitte Greenway for the No King New Orleans rally, organizers told CBS News. When asked about how numbers were counted, they said it was based on RSVPs online and other on-the-ground crowd-counting measures.",
      "In Chicago's Grant Park, Democratic Congresswoman Delia Ramirez led the crowd in a chant, \"When I say people, you say power!\"",
      "\"May that powerful voice be heard from here to Washington, D.C., and every corner of this country,\" Ramirez said, CBS Chicago reported. \"I am the proud daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, and I will never be ashamed of my roots.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker joined the demonstration.",
      "In San Francisco hundreds of people spelled out \"No King!\" and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she too had never been to a protest before. Only recently she began to view Trump as a \"dictator.\"",
      "\"I was actually OK with everything until I found that the military invasion in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland \u2014 Portland bothered me the most, because I'm from Portland, and I don't want the military in my cities. That's scary,\" Wingard said.",
      "In Miami, one demonstrator told CBS Miami\u00a0that she showed up to give voice to those who feel the most marginalized in the country.",
      "\"I'm most worried about people who aren't doing well in this country, people who are being marginalized,\" said Roxanne Featherly. \"The hate [and] I guess you can say the bipolarism that we have.\"",
      "More than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and openly citing the city's history of protests and the critical role it played in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement two generations ago, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"It just feels like we're living in an America that I don't recognize,\" Jessica Yother, a mother of four, told the AP. \"It was so encouraging. I walked in and thought, 'Here are my people.'\"",
      "Outside of the U.S., crowds gathered outside U.S. embassies in Berlin, Rome, Paris and Sweden in solidarity with the protesters in the U.S. Photos show them holding signs denouncing fascism and dictatorships.",
      "So far, the president's response to the events has been muted.",
      "\"They're saying they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,\" he told Fox News show \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" in an interview that will air on Sunday.",
      "But top surrogates, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, dismissed the event. Johnson called it the \"Hate America Rally.\"",
      "\"You're going to bring together the Marxists, the Socialists, the Antifa advocates, the anarchists and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat Party,\" he told reporters.",
      "Republican lawmaker Tom Emmer also used the \"Hate America\" phrase and referred to participants as the \"terrorist wing\" of the Democratic Party. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin activated the National Guard and announced a \"substantially increased police presence\" ahead of the planned events. He said that protestors have the right to free speech but that \"does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic, or violence of any kind\u2014for which there will be zero tolerance.\" Texas Gov.

      "And that's exactly what happened to me, reporting on the case of Joe Shymanski, a Washington, D.C., photographer murdered in 2023. Covering this story took me back into some of the most familiar terrain of my life \u2014 my tiny, Pennsylvania hometown. But it also took me into unfamiliar territory: confronting someone I grew up with caught up in a murder case.",
      "Heather Snyder and I hadn't communicated since 1998, the year I literally crowned her my successor as high school homecoming queen. Fast forward to 2025, and I discovered that the very same Heather I knew was a central character in this story. She was now Joe Shymanski's ex-wife. She was the one who reported Joe Shymanski missing and it was Heather's boyfriend after leaving Joe Shymanski, Brandon Holbrook, who became authorities' prime suspect in Joe's murder.",
      "In an exclusive interview, Heather answered my questions about her relationship with Holbrook. She has an alibi and emphatically told us she had no involvement in Joe's murder. She has never been identified by authorities as a suspect or charged with a crime in connection with the Shymanski case.",
      "But Heather was the only known link between Joe Shymanski and Holbrook. And Joe Shymanski's loved ones started asking questions about her.",
      "\"She just needed it done and she found her person that would do that for her,\" Joe's niece Janine Shymanski said.",
      "Janine Shymanski and other friends and relatives spelled out their suspicions of Heather Snyder and Heather addressed those suspicions in\u00a0\"My Uncle Joe's Murder,\"\u00a0an all-new \"48 Hours\" airing Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025, at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Heather said she began dating Joe Shymanski when they were vendors at a weekly Washington, D.C., food and crafts fair at the historic Eastern Market. Joe Shymanski sold his photographs there and Heather had a vegetable business. She had three children from a previous marriage, but wanted a big family and she remembers being excited to learn that Joe Shymanski wanted kids. She said that in the beginning, he was funny, charming and swept her off her feet.",
      "\"It was like a fairy tale,\" Heather said.",
      "They married in July 2014, Heather said, and bought a house in Calvert County, Maryland. She gave birth to a daughter and a son a year apart. But she says Joe Shymanski soon became obsessive about his kids and started to push her and her three older children aside. She says he became emotionally abusive to her and in one instance, she claims, he got physical.",
      "The Shymanski family and friends say Heather Snyder's allegations do not match the Joe Shymanski they knew. One friend told me Heather was attracted to Joe Shymanski's money \u2014 an allegation she denies. Snyder says the pandemic only made things worse. She took the kids and left Joe Shymanski in July 2021, moving back to our hometown in Pennsylvania. Before long, she says, she began seeing Holbrook, who she met online. But Joe Shymanski's friend Anneli Werner said the turbulence of Heather and Joe's relationship was far from over.",
      "\"Joe was in an ugly, contentious divorce,\" Werner remembered.",
      "By the summer of 2023, Joe Shymanski had bought a million-dollar life insurance policy listing his two minor children as beneficiaries. The court had awarded him and Heather joint custody of the kids but gave Joe Shymanski primary physical custody when school was in session. And the judge had also reduced the amount Joe Shymanski owed her in the settlement.",
      "\"Joe had started winning,\" Anneli said.",
      "Joe Shymanski reported missing",
      "It was Labor Day 2023 at 7:47 p.m. when authorities got the call from Heather to report Joe Shymanski missing. She told them she had driven to her ex-husband's house to drop off their children in a custody exchange but had not found him home. So, she said she checked with the neighbors and then called 911. Investigators found Joe's keys and phone inside his house. When a sheriff's deputy escorted Heather inside to get pajamas for the kids, his body camera shows her getting emotional.",
      "The next day, Calvert County investigators questioned Heather at the sheriff's office.",
      "\"Are you in any relationship right now?\" asked Calvert County investigator Joshua Buck. \"No,\" Heather replied. \"No boyfriends or \u2014 ?\" Buck continued. \"No,\" she answered. \"I had a boyfriend but, briefly. But I don't.\"",
      "Heather told Calvert County investigators she had recently broken up with Holbrook, who also lived in Pennsylvania. But they soon unearthed an image of his truck and license plate near Joe Shymanski's house in Maryland the day Joe disappeared. The Calvert County, Maryland, Sheriff's Office, which declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview, sent investigators to Pennsylvania. With the help of Pennsylvania police, they approached Holbrook's house at about 11 p.m. on Sept. 5, 2023.",
      "When they brought Holbrook to police headquarters for questioning, he told them he was a driver for a plant that processed waste from chicken slaughterhouses. Despite the camera images showing his truck near Joe Shymanski's house, Holbrook claimed he hadn't been there \u2014 or anywhere in Maryland \u2014 around the time Joe disappeared. But investigators found items that struck them as curious. On Holbrook's property, there were firearms, plastic tarps, rubber gloves and cleaning fluid. There was also an open package of power saw blades without a matching saw.",
      "\"Is that a tool that's powerful enough to dismember a body?\" I asked Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, Detective Jessica Aurand, who helped investigate the case. \"\u2026 Possibly,\" she answered.",
      "By this point, authorities had also noted a strange smell coming from Holbrook's truck in the driveway, said Mifflin County Police Department Sgt. John Chester. In the back, they found something an investigator noted appeared to be human blood.",
      "\"It looked like a homicide scene,\" Chester said.",
      "But the blood in the truck would turn out to have come from an animal.",
      "\"Because he had access to the \u2026 chicken plant, did he put stuff in there and cover it up with chicken remains?\" Aurand wondered aloud.",
      "Despite having no body, authorities arrested Holbrook shortly afterward. The next day in a field near Holbrook's house, they located human remains that later turned out to match Joe Shymanski.",
      "All of this happened only about 45 minutes from where Heather Snyder and I grew up.",
      "Both our families still live in Newport, Pennsylvania, home to only about 1,500 people. Even when you add up the cars and the horse-drawn, Amish buggies, there still isn't enough traffic for a single stoplight. As a kid there, I never dreamed I would become a contributor to \"48 Hours.\" And if you'd told me I was one day going to interview a former teammate mentioned in connection with a murder case, I would have said you were crazy.",
      "It was downright surreal when a \"48 Hours\" producer first told me that a murder victim's family had questions about someone I knew in my youth. The Heather I remembered was a top student, a cheerleader and the treasurer of her class. We played field hockey together.",
      "I knew Heather might not want to talk to me. If I could convince her to do an interview, I also knew it would mean asking her the toughest questions. When I learned another national news program was looking into the story, I contacted Heather. As I suspected, she told me it was too soon to talk to me. She said she wouldn't consider meeting until after Holbrook's trial last spring.",
      "The trial of Brandon Holbrook",
      "Prosecutors would argue Holbrook shot Joe Shymanski to death in Joe's Maryland driveway, then drove his body back to Pennsylvania, dismembering him and disposing of his remains. They showed the images of Holbrook's truck near Joe Shymanski's house that night and video showing Holbrook shopping for cleaning supplies the next morning. They even showed video of Holbrook dumping what turned out to be human remains next to the parking lot outside the store.",
      "Holbrook's defense team had little choice but to acknowledge there was evidence he was involved in disposing of Joe's body. But they pointed out that there were no forensics tying him to the murder itself \u2014 nothing placing him at Joe Shymanski's house \u2014 the images of his truck near Joe's house hadn't been clear enough to identify the driver, nor anything proving Joe Shymanski \u2014 alive or dead \u2014 was ever at Holbrook's house.",
      "Defense attorney Brendan Callahan insisted Holbrook had no motive to want Joe Shymanski dead and that his client may not have been the only one involved. Callahan said authorities failed to sufficiently investigate Heather Snyder and were slow to recover a gun she told them she had at home. He says they never searched her property.",
      "\"Only one person's life is better today than it was before the murder of Joseph Shymanski,\" said Callahan. \"And that is Heather Snyder.\"",
      "Callahan argued Heather might have stood to gain custody of her two youngest children and, since they were minors, control over any life insurance payout they received.",
      "In all, Heather Snyder was mentioned more than 400 times in the Brandon Holbrook murder trial \u2013 so many times it felt to me like she was on trial too.",
      "Both sides had listed Heather as a witness. Everyone in the crowded courtroom wanted to hear what she had to say under oath. On the fifth day of trial testimony, she was called to the stand. But Heather invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The jury gasped. But prosecutors later introduced Heather's alibi: photos taken in her Pennsylvania home and video showing her buying a pizza in a Newport grocery store around the time Joe Shymanski was killed about a three-hour drive away.",
      "It took the jury just 80 minutes to convict Holbrook of first-degree, premeditated murder. As I said, Heather Snyder has never been charged with a crime in this case.",
      "Questions for Heather Snyder",
      "After the trial, I met with Heather to talk about doing an interview. I think it's fair to say she was reluctant, but she told me she understood she was the best person to tell her story. She also seemed keenly aware that Joe Shymanski's family felt she was somehow involved in his death. She said she wanted to set the record straight and ultimately, she agreed to sit down with me for our \"48 Hours\" report. No questions were off limits.",
      "On a rainy night in May 2025, our team set up our gear in a converted barn just minutes from both of our parents' homes. As I was waiting for Heather to arrive, I recorded my thoughts in a kind of video diary.",
      "When we began the interview itself, Heather seemed nervous, but before long, she became more poised.",
      "\"Did you ever say to Brandon Holbrook, I wish Joe were dead?\" I asked her.\u202f\"No,\" she said, and continued, \"\u2026 the most I said to Brandon was that I thought Joe should be in jail for the way he was acting.\"",
      "\"Did Brandon tell you he wanted to kill Joe?\" I asked. \"Nope,\" she said. \"Did you help him cover it up?\" I continued. \"Nope. Nope,\" she answered.",
      "Heather told me that a criminal lawyer advised her to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege at the Holbrook trial. \"If you don't have anything to hide, why not just get up there and testify?\" I asked. \"\u2026 People twist your words,\" Heather replied.",
      "I asked her about texts with Holbrook in which he suggests \"other solutions\" for her problems with Joe.",
      "\"I thought it was a \u2014 just a joke,\" Heather said. \"It didn't cross your mind for a second \u2013.\" \"No,\" she responded. \"That he might hurt Joe?\" I continued. \"No,\" Heather said.",
      "I also asked her about text messages about her hope that karma would catch up with Joe in which she had said she was \"tired of being patient.\"",
      "\"That's how I was feeling \u2026\" Heather told me. \"Do you think \u2026 that may have triggered Brandon?\" I asked. \"I don't know,\" she said.",
      "\"Are you afraid authorities will come for you?\" I wanted to know. \"No,\" Heather said. \"Not at all?\" I asked. \"I'm not worried at all, no ...\" she said.",
      "We asked Calvert County's top prosecutor, Robert Harvey, for an interview about the Joe Shymanski murder investigation and about Heather Snyder. Harvey declined our request but wrote to us that there was \"\u2026 a thorough and exhaustive investigation \u2026\" into Mr. Shymanski's death. \"Mr. Holbrook received a 'fair and impartial trial \u2026'\" Harvey continued. \"Because Mr. Holbrook's case is under appeal \u2026 it remains open,\" Harvey continued. \"Therefore, I am not going to respond to questions regarding the investigation and I am not going to speculate on what may or may not happen in the future.\"",
      "We also asked Pennsylvania authorities about the status of the case:",
      "\"Is there a current investigation into Heather Snyder?\" I asked. \"I can't answer that question,\" said Aurand. \"Should there be?\" I continued. \"I can't answer that question,\" Aurand responded. \"Do you think Heather Snyder is involved in this crime in any way?\" I continued. \"I can't answer that,\" Aurand said. \"But you do know the answer,\" I asked.\u202f\"Yes. But I'm not allowed to say,\" Aurand said.",
      "Heather Snyder told me despite it all, she wants to keep Joe Shymanski's memory alive for their children. She knows the Shymanski family wants to see them and says she is open to the idea, assuming they stop publicly pointing a finger at her.",
      "She added she still has love for Holbrook, though she believes he belongs behind bars. \"I think obviously psychologically he snapped over something,\" she told me. \"I think he did something horrible, horrific. He hurt my family. He hurt me.\" Last July, a judge sentenced Brandon Holbrook to life in prison with no parole.",
      "\"So many people watching are gonna be frustrated,\" I said. \"Uh-huh,\" she agreed. \"\u2026 and they're gonna think it \u2014 it just \u2014 logically you have to had known something.\" \"Right,\" she said. \"But I didn't. That's the torturous part, because people will \u2014 it's almost like they want to believe that I was involved with it. They want that true-crime narrative. And it just simply wasn't the case.\""

    "story": [
      "The investigation of Joe Shymanski's murder began as a missing persons case. It was Sept. 4, 2023, at 7:47 p.m. when sheriff's deputies in Calvert County, Maryland, were called to the home of the well-known photographer.",
      "His ex-wife, Heather Snyder, met them in the driveway. She would tell authorities she had arrived by car at about 7 p.m. from her home in Pennsylvania to hand off custody of their then-8-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son.",
      "HEATHER SNYDER (bodycam video): Um, I was supposed to return the kids to him.",
      "DEPUTY: OK.",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: At 7 o'clock tonight ...",
      "HEATHER SNYDER (bodycam video): \u2026 kids went in the house cause he did \u2014 he usually just comes right out, like he knows that they're coming.",
      "But nobody was home. Heather Snyder had checked with the neighbors and called 911.",
      "HEATHER SNYDER (bodycam video): Yeah, I don't know what I even should do at this point.",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: \u2026 everything about it's weird.",
      "DEPUTY: OK.",
      "What happened to Joe Shymanski?",
      "All the signs suggested Joe Shymanski should be there. His car was in the driveway, his keys and phone were in the house. Authorities started searching the property \u2013 even using a drone.",
      "DEPUTY (bodycam video): Do you know if he ever goes out hiking in the woods or anything?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: I mean, I wouldn't put it past him.",
      "Heather Snyder: I answered their questions about everything they asked, you know, the situation \u2026",
      "Among other things investigators wanted to know about was Heather and Joe's divorce from the previous year.",
      "Alison Stinson-Pounsberry: I know it was very contentious. So there was a lot of arguing \u2026 specifically the drop-off location for the kids was their biggest argument.",
      "Shymanski's neighbors Alison Stinson-Pounsberry and Colton Pounsberry were home that night when Heather Snyder knocked on the door.",
      "Alison Stinson-Pounsberry: She had asked me if Joe was here. I said, no.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How was Heather acting?",
      "Alison Stinson-Pounsberry: So, Heather was acting a little annoyed \u2026 She was annoyed that he wasn't here for drop-off after she had already driven four hours.",
      "The Pounsberrys went to Joe Shymanski's home, telling authorities they hadn't seen Joe since the previous afternoon.",
      "COLTON POUNDSBERRY (bodycam video):\u00a0 Yeah, we saw him yesterday about 4 o'clock. He was helping me with some drywall.",
      "DEPUTY: OK.",
      "COLTON POUNSBERRY: We gave him some dinner \u2026",
      "DEPUTY: Any depression issues?",
      "COLTON POUNSBERRY: None that I noticed.",
      "DEPUTY What do you think is going on?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: I have no idea.",
      "DEPUTY: OK. Alright.",
      "The Pounsberrys ended up giving Heather and the kids places to sleep for the night. But first Heather went inside Joe's house.",
      "Heather Snyder: I didn't have any clothes for the kids \u2026 So it was late at night they let me go in and get \u2026 pajamas.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Do you remember how you were feeling when you went inside?",
      "Heather Snyder: Upset \u2026 It was surreal.",
      "HEATHER SNYDER (bodycam video): I'm sorry. (crying)",
      "DEPUTY: No, You're fine. Absolutely fine. It's a lot to deal with \u2026",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: I just feel bad for my kids. What am I gonna tell them? (crying)",
      "Ted Shymanski: How could he not be there? Especially knowing that the kids were going to be there.",
      "It was about two-and-a-half hours later that Heather Snyder called Joe's older brother Ted Shymanski and Ted's wife \u2013 also named Heather.",
      "Heather Shymanski: I felt like I was like punched in the stomach.",
      "Ted Shymanski:\u00a0 So there was no way in the world that Joe woulda missed \u2026 this meeting with the kids. \u2026 This isn \u2014 something's wrong.",
      "It fell to Ted Shymanski to deliver the news to his sister Mary Shymanski.",
      "Mary Shymanski: When I heard that Joe \u2026 was missing, I fell to my knees and said a prayer. \u2026 Because this was such a bizarre situation it felt like I needed, I needed something greater than me right away \u2026",
      "And then the morning after Joe disappeared, investigators noticed something they'd been unable to see at night. There was blood in his driveway.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did Joe have any enemies?",
      "Alison Stinson-Pounsberry: Not that we knew of.",
      "An investigator asked Heather Snyder to come to the station.",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK (questioning): Do you know of anybody that \u2014 that'd be, uh, an enemy of his?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: No \u2026",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK: .\u2026 are you in any relationship right now?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: \u00a0No.",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK: No boyfriends or \u2014?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: No.",
      "But Heather Snyder told them she had recently broken up with someone who lived near her in Pennsylvania.",
      "HEATHER SNYDER (questioning):\u00a0 I had a boyfriend but, briefly. But I don't -",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK: Recently?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: Yeah, within the last couple months, yeah.",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK: What's his name?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: Brandon Holbrook.",
      "Mary Shymanski: The name Brandon Holbrook entered the scene quite quickly.",
      "The Shymanskis say Joe told them he'd never met Brandon Holbrook.",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK (questioning): How long were you and Brandon together?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: We were friends for a while. Um, since 20 \u2013 2022? I wanna say.",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK: OK.",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: Or it might have been, like, November 2021.",
      "Authorities then decided to look more closely at Brandon Holbrook.",
      "They pulled his car registration and discovered a camera had picked up his license plate near Joe Shymanski's house the very day Joe vanished. Investigators now had a person of interest, and headed to Pennsylvania, notifying police there.",
      "A grisly discovery",
      "On Sept. 5, 2023, Sgt. John Chester of the Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, Police Department got a call that Maryland authorities were investigating a homicide. They wanted to talk to a person of interest: Brandon Holbrook.",
      "Sgt. John Chester: We've arrested Mr. Holbrook in the past.",
      "Over the years, Holbrook had pleaded guilty to at least five counts of indecent exposure. They approached his house at about 11 p.m.",
      "An investigator noted Holbrook's eyes were bloodshot, and that there was a strange, particular smell \u2014 both on him and the covered bed of his pickup in the driveway.",
      "SGT. JOHN CHESTER (bodycam video):\u00a0 This truck reeks.",
      "BODY CAM DEPUTY: \u2026 man, that smells terrible.",
      "SGT. JOHN CHESTER: It smelled like death.",
      "Holbrook told authorities he was a driver for a Pennsylvania plant that processes chicken slaughterhouse waste. He denied being near Joe's house or anywhere in Maryland the day Joe disappeared.",
      "Sgt. John Chester:\u00a0 We knew his truck was in Maryland \u2026",
      "One police report indicates he also denied any contact with Joe. Another says he \"was not being entirely truthful ... and appeared nervous.\"\u00a0 So, in the early morning hours of Sept. 6, 2023, investigators arrested Brandon Holbrook for the murder of Joe Shymanski.",
      "By then, Detective Jessica Aurand had reported for duty.",
      "Det. Jessica Aurand: I was called in when they got back to the station with him.",
      "Aurand helped them get warrants for Holbrook's truck and house.",
      "Sgt. John Chester: We still didn't know \u2026 the magnitude of what we were dealing with \u2026",
      "In the truck cab, investigators found gloves and plastic sheeting and in the truck bed, something described as human blood.",
      "Sgt. John Chester: It looked like a homicide scene.",
      "There were firearms in the house and plastic garbage bags, bleach, Lysol, and wet tools in a trailer outside.",
      "In the garage, Aurand says, \"there was an open tool case.\" And next to it, an open package of power saw blades. But investigators didn't spot a matching saw.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Is that a tool that's powerful enough to dismember a body?",
      "Det. Jessica Aurand: Possibly.",
      "Authorities with cadaver dogs began following a dirt road catty-corner to Holbrook's house, leading into the woods. The next day, they made a grisly discovery in a clearing near a creek.",
      "Det. Jessica Aurand: They found the jawbone \u2026 with some of the ear \u2026 and some teeth still intact.",
      "Incident reports show there was also a burn barrel which smelled of decomposition. Scattered nearby \u2014 piles of ash. Authorities sent the material off for testing, but they had a strong hunch they were human remains, and a strong hunch whose.",
      "Fearing the worst, Joe Shymanski's family and friends gathered in Washington.",
      "Alton McDougle:\u00a0 He was a person that would give you his shirt off his back, even in a rainstorm \u2026",
      "Joe Shymanski met Alton McDougle in 2000 after coming to D.C. to teach middle school history and social studies. McDougle says Joe became his mentor, exposing him to new ideas \u2014 and to photography.",
      "Nikki Battiste:\u00a0 He taught you how to see the world?",
      "Alton McDougle: Yes. Through a lens.",
      "They eventually became friends, says McDougle, and partnered in the photo business at Eastern Market. That's where Joe first started dating Heather Snyder. She was then a single mom of three kids and was running a vegetable business.",
      "Heather Snyder: He was fun \u2026 very charming.",
      "Nikki Battiste: And then he swept you off your feet?",
      "Heather Snyder: He did \u2026",
      "Heather Snyder and Joe Shymanski married in July 2014 and bought a house in rural Calvert County. Heather Snyder gave birth to a daughter and a son a year later, but Joe's family and friends say by 2020, the marriage was in trouble.",
      "Mary Shymanski: Heather Snyder and Joe Shymanski were never on equal footing financially.",
      "Alton McDougle: The spending was definitely a problem \u2026",
      "McDougle says Joe wrote Heather Snyder a check for thousands of dollars to pay off a debt on a house she owned, then he gave her more money to help her launch a new business.",
      "Alton McDougle: I used to tell him all the time \u2026 she's using you.",
      "Heather Snyder says that's not true. She was never after Joe's money. She blames the difficulties in the marriage on Joe, saying he could behave erratically, and that he started pushing her and her older children away after their own kids were born.",
      "Heather Snyder: Joe's attention was just on \u2026 those two children. He was almost obsessive to a degree. It was, he cared less about what I thought or what I was saying \u2026 and it was all about those two.",
      "She says Joe was emotionally abusive to her. And there was one instance, she claims, when he got physical.",
      "Heather Snyder: He bodychecked me into a car. And that was after chasing me around the house \u2026",
      "The Shymanski family says Heather Snyder's abuse allegations don't match the Joe they knew. By 2021, Snyder says she'd had enough.",
      "Heather Snyder: I was afraid he was gonna snap and hurt me and then my children were gonna see it \u2026",
      "Nikki Battiste: You just left?",
      "Heather Snyder: I left.",
      "Mary Shymanski: He was devastated.",
      "Joe's friend Anneli Werner noticed it too.",
      "Anneli Werner: That spark that made Joe \"Joe\" was gone, it was gone!",
      "Heather Snyder had moved back to her hometown of Newport, Pennsylvania. She told investigators that it was a few months later that she began seeing Brandon Holbrook. All the while, say Joe's friends and family, he and Heather Snyder were arguing over custody and cash. It got so bad Heather Snyder says she began recording their interactions around the kids. Werner says Joe was also upset and made recordings too, about Heather Snyder, for their children to hear one day.",
      "JOE SHYMANSKI (audio recording): Mom has a way of manipulating everyone.",
      "JOE SHYMANSKI (audio recording): Everyone. She's toxic. Honestly, I am honestly afraid for your mental and emotional safety.",
      "JOE SHYMANSKI (audio recording): There's no safety in mom for me. It's dangerous to be close to mom for me.",
      "Anneli Werner: Joe was in a contentious, ugly divorce.",
      "But Werner says things had slowly started going Joe's way. Though he and Heather had joint legal custody of the kids, he had primary physical custody when school was in session. He'd bought a million-dollar life insurance policy naming the children as beneficiaries. And just weeks before he vanished, the court had reduced the settlement he owed Heather Snyder.",
      "Anneli Werner: Joe had started winning! ...",
      "A haunting conversation",
      "In mid-September 2023, forensic experts matched the remains that they found in that clearing near Brandon Holbrook's house to Joe Shymanski. Mifflin County Coroner Andrea Alcalde.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was Joe Shymanski's cause of death?",
      "Coroner Andrea Alcalde: Uh, he had a gunshot wound to the head.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was his manner of death?",
      "Coroner Andrea Alcalde: Homicide.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Could you just state your name?",
      "BRANDON HOLBROOK:\u00a0 My name is Brandon Holbrook.",
      "BRANDON HOLBROOK: This is \u2014 thing has my whole head messed up.",
      "Authorities had uncovered evidence that didn't look good for Brandon Holbrook.",
      "Sgt. John Chester: We knew the white truck had been in Maryland based on \u2026 the license plate reader had read the \u2026 tag and the tag matched the vehicle that was sitting here.",
      "And with the saw blades in Holbrook's garage, the cleaning supplies and tools in his trailer, and Joe's remains in the clearing nearby, it all seemed to suggest that Holbrook had killed Joe in Maryland and brought his body to Pennsylvania. But for all the evidence investigators had, the case still contained some inconvenient truths.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you find any of Joe Shymanski's remains on Brandon Holbrook's property?",
      "Det. Jessica Aurand:\u00a0 No.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you find the murder weapon?",
      "Det. Jessica Aurand:\u00a0 No.",
      "In addition, records show Holbrook's phone had only pinged towers near his Pennsylvania home the afternoon and evening Joe disappeared. And remember, images of Holbrook's truck in Maryland did not show who was driving. And when the blood in the truck bed was tested, it wasn't human. It was animal.",
      "Det. Jessica Aurand: Because he had access to the \u2026 chicken plant, did he put stuff in there and cover it up with the chicken remains?",
      "Joe's family and friends had trouble believing Holbrook could have devised such an elaborate plot without help.",
      "Mary Shymanski: I do not believe that Brandon Holbrook is the only person involved in my brother's death. I think he was highly inspired by Heather Snyder. \u2026 Heather Snyder is the common denominator in this entire picture.",
      "Alton McDougle also thinks Heather Snyder was involved. A few days before Joe went missing, McDougle says they were hanging out and Joe told him Heather Snyder was coming over to drop off the kids instead of meeting halfway between their homes like they usually did. McDougle says he told Joe that concerned him.",
      "Alton McDougle: I just don't want her to come to your house, dude \u2026 I just don't trust her.",
      "He says Joe dismissed his concern, but the conversation haunts him to this day.",
      "Alton McDougle: I get chills right now. (crying)",
      "Nikki Battiste: What are you feeling? That if he listened to you, he might still be here?",
      "Alton McDougle: I mean, he might be, right?",
      "Joe's family and friends acknowledge their suspicion of Heather Snyder was just a gut feeling, and that the investigation hasn't turned up any evidence of her involvement. Nevertheless, McDougle says he shared his speculation with authorities.",
      "Alton McDougle: Heather, at least, planned it. \u2026 her boyfriend had at least helped \u2026",
      "He says he and the family find it strange that Heather Snyder reported Joe as missing before he was even an hour late.",
      "Heather Shymanski: You're jumping to \u2013",
      "Ted Shymanski: He's missing \u2026 then he's gone \u2026 call the police \u2026",
      "Heather Shymanski: \u2014 then he's missing like \u2026 I mean and you're gonna call 911?",
      "Especially, they say, because she had then waited more than two-and-a-half hours to notify them.",
      "Mary Shymanski: That seems like extraordinary long period of time before she'd let the immediate family know that Joe was missing.",
      "And they question\u00a0 Heather Snyder's behavior when she went in Joe's house with investigators.",
      "Anneli Werner: And she walks in the house \u2026 and she begins to cry \u2026 sobbing over her ex-husband that she would do anything to get away from.",
      "They suspected it was all an act, something Heather Snyder denies.",
      "Alton McDougle:\u00a0 She just wanted to paint a picture that he was missing because she knew the plan.",
      "And the Shymanskis believe she was untruthful with investigators about Brandon Holbrook.",
      "INVESTIGATOR JOSHUA BUCK (reprise questioning): ... are you in any relationship right now?",
      "HEATHER SNYDER: No.",
      "Mary Shymanski: She told the police that \u2026 she broke up with him and that they were no longer together. B-------.",
      "Janine Shymanski says she suspects Heather Snyder had used Holbrook to get rid of Joe Shymanski.",
      "Janine Shymanski: \u2026 So she just needed it done and she found her person that would do that for her.",
      "Nikki Battiste: You think Heather Snyder was the mastermind?",
      "Janine Shymanski: Yes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was there any doubt in your mind?",
      "Janine Shymanski: No.",
      "Holbrook was in custody and authorities had combed the clearing. But weeks later, Mary Shymanski was visiting the site when she found more burnt remains. She acknowledges searchers may have simply missed them in the woods, but she and Coroner Andrea Alcalde believe there's another possibility.",
      "Coroner Andrea Alcalde: I think the more likely is that there were remains dumped after the fact.",
      "That would mean they were dumped by someone else.",
      "Nikki Battiste: That's a bombshell.",
      "Coroner Andrea Alcalde: Yeah \u2026",
      "But Alcalde says Maryland authorities seemed skeptical. The Calvert County Sheriff's Office declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview. Still, the theory that someone else was involved in Joe Shymanski's death is a point Holbrook's attorneys will argue from the start of his trial.",
      "Defense Attorney Brendan Callahan: Only one person's life is better today than it was before the murder of Joseph Shymanski. And that is Heather Snyder.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you have anything to do with Joe's death?",
      "Heather Snyder:\u00a0 I did not.",
      "The trial of Brandon Holbrook",
      "On March 31, 2025, the trial of Brandon Holbrook for the murder of Joe Shymanski got underway. Prosecutors wanted a conviction on premeditated murder. They argued Holbrook fatally shot Joe Shymanski in Maryland, drove him back to Pennsylvania, put chicken parts in his truck to cover his tracks and then disposed of Joe's remains in that clearing near Holbrook's house. And they brought in the barrel searchers found, suggesting it was used to burn him. But Holbrook's defense team says it was a tactic.",
      "Defense Attorney Brendan Callahan: It was there for the emotional impact.",
      "There were no cameras allowed in court. Defense attorney Brendan Callahan tried to turn the jury's attention away from Brandon Holbrook and towards Heather Snyder. She was mentioned more than 400 times at trial, though she hasn't been charged with a crime.",
      "Defense Attorney Brendan Callahan: The only person with an obvious motive \u2026 was Heather Snyder. She was in a \u2014 a heated custody fight that was not going well for her ...",
      "And Callahan told the jury Heather Snyder had a million other reasons, too. If Joe Shymanski was dead, Callahan said, she might stand to gain control of his life insurance payout since her children, the beneficiaries, are still minors.",
      "Defense Attorney Brendan Callahan: When you throw in \u2026 a million-dollar life insurance policy \u2026 the \u2014 the motives write themselves.",
      "Heather Snyder told \"48 Hours\" she knew nothing about Joe's life insurance before he died.",
      "Prosecutors kept the focus on Holbrook. They introduced videos of his truck near Joe's house in Maryland the day Joe disappeared, Holbrook shopping for cleaning supplies in Pennsylvania the morning after, and video that's hard to see, but that they say shows Holbrook near his white truck dumping something which turned out to be burned human remains. It put the defense in a corner.",
      "Defense Attorney Brendan Callahan: There's evidence that he is involved at some point, but there's very little evidence that he's the one who committed the actual murder.",
      "And while Holbrook's truck might have been spotted near Joe's house that day, Callahan says someone else could have been driving it.",
      "Defense Attorney Brendan Callahan: Brandon Holbrook had absolutely no reason to kill Joseph Shymanski.",
      "The state contended Holbrook did have a motive: love for Heather Snyder and hate for Joe Shymanski intense enough that Holbrook took matters into his own hands.",

      "Prosecutors painted a picture of that obsession \u2014 showing an image taken nearly seven months before the murder, of a car Holbrook also owned, near Joe Shymanski's house. And they showed a text exchange between Heather Snyder and Holbrook from Jan. 21, 2023, also months before the murder, in which she is complaining about Joe. \"... I'm just tired of the abuse.\" Heather Snyder told him, \"It's been years upon years. ...\" Holbrook later suggested she see a therapist but added:\u00a0 \"I have other solutions in mind, but probably not the best way to go.\"",
      "Defense Attorney Brendan Callahan: That could mean a lot of things. I mean it's very easy to read in it \u2013 the\u00a0 most nefarious intent and that's what the State tried to do in this case. But it could mean just about anything. It could be a joke.",

She agreed to the interview with no questions off limits. She acknowledged she was upset with Joe Shymanski during their custody fight.",
      "Nikki Battiste: \u2026 did you ever say to Brandon Holbrook, I wish Joe were dead?",

      "From\u00a0vehicle crashes\u00a0to\u00a0forceful takedowns, encounters with federal agents captured on cellphone video have gone viral amid the crackdown.

Now, though, many of those Border Patrol agents have been deployed on the streets\u00a0of cities like Chicago.",
      "\"What strikes me immediately is how this administration has put these agents in a terrible position,\"\u00a0John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE, told CBS News. \"...These are units that are designed to address high-risk threats and bring overwhelming force to bear. And I think the big flaw here is, not, I don't blame these agents. I blame the administration for putting agents, who are trained in this manner, in a city where they don't belong.\"",
      "Federal agents deployed tear gas on a crowd on Tuesday on the South Side of Chicago following a crash involving a federal vehicle. That use of tear gas\u00a0prompted a federal judge\u00a0Thursday to express concern and issue an order Friday that agents in Chicago wear body cameras in response\u00a0to a lawsuit\u00a0brought by several media organizations over allegations that forceful tactics were being used by federal agents against protesters and journalists.",
      "\"I'm glad that the judge is stepping up, doing the right thing,\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters. \"I think we're going to see more cases brought against ICE and CBP.\"",

      "\"The use of force policies for DHS are pretty consistent with law enforcement agencies around the country,\" Sandweg said. \"The use of force that you use needs to be reasonable to the threat that you face. You are required to try to de-escalate a situation first.\"",
      "CBS News showed some of the viral clips to DHS. In response, a DHS spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the videos show \"a growing and dangerous trend of illegal aliens and agitators obstructing and attacking law enforcement.\"",

      "\"The agents have a mission, and they're only going to tolerate so much,\" Robinette said. \"And when somebody crosses that line, you know, the administration has pretty much given them orders that they are not to back down.\"",
      "Robinette said he believes the U.S. is in uncharted territory as it relates to these immigration raids and the protests that have stemmed from them.",
      "\"We've never had to deal with these kinds of extreme confrontations,\" Robinette said. \"You know, there have been isolated incidents, but nothing like we're seeing today. And for us, obviously, this is something totally foreign to us.\""

About 1.8 million Americans got divorced in 2023, according to Pew \u2014 reshaping how families and households are formed, often in surprising ways.",
      "Two-thirds of divorced Americans marry again, according to the Pew analysis released Thursday, which focused on what it called in its report \"eight facts\" about divorce in the U.S.",
      "Men and women are remarrying at a fairly similar rate, though divorced men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, Pew found. A slight caveat, the analysis showed, was that widows are less likely to remarry than women who have been divorced.",
      "And Pew found that 46% of divorced Americans who have remarried have a child with their current spouse.",
      "\"A sizeable fraction of Americans who've divorced have gone on to form new families,\" lead study author and Pew research associate Jake Hays told CBS News.",

Pew found that the median household wealth, or net worth, of divorced working adults was $98,700 in 2023, while those in their first marriage had a median household wealth of $326,900. Remarried people had a slightly higher net worth of $329,100, Pew found.",

      "Pew researchers found that, overall, the divorce rate has continued to decline since the 1980s, with gray divorces being the exception. Although the gray divorce rate has leveled off recently, after rising from 1990 to 2008, Pew found.",
      "That leveling off could be due to several reasons, Shrout and Weiser said. There are fewer marriages today compared to previous generations, and some older people are in committed relationships without marriage. Just like younger couples,\u00a0cohabitation\u00a0without marriage is an increasingly popular choice among older adults. There are also those couples who choose to live apart, a term referred to as \"living apart together,\" where they maintain separate homes while in a committed relationship, the professors wrote.",

      "Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction.",
      "Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message.",
      "The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from \"his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care,\" Takano said.",
      "Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. \"For me, it's like \u2013 I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with.\"",

    "summary": "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager had said.",
    "story": [
      "Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, died on Thursday, his family and agent said. He was 74.",
      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall at his home, his agent said.",
      "Family members said in a statement\u00a0that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken.\"",
      "\"In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" Frehley's family said. \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\"",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",
      "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager, John Ostrosky, also known as John Ostronomy, said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0last month addressed to fans. Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",
      "In 2024, the band sold its catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be more than $300 million."

The company said Thursday that authorized representatives and estate owners can request that a public figure's likeness not be used in Sora 2 videos.",
      "\"While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,\" OpenAI and King's estate said.",

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed the issue in a blog post earlier this month, noting that the company will give copyrights owners \"more granular control over generation of characters.\""

      "Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency in charge of the legal immigration system, said the vetting effort primarily relies on what he called the \"social media screening\" of people applying for green cards and other immigration applications.",
      "In August, the Trump administration issued a directive instructing USCIS officials to consider the identification of \"anti-American\" views and activity of certain applicants for immigration benefits as an \"overwhelmingly negative factor\" that could justify denial.",
      "Asked what types of views and activities could be found to be \"anti-American\" by his agency, Edlow cited \"what we've seen college campuses to have allowed over the last several years.\"",
      "\"There has been such a large-scale espousing of foreign terrorist ideology, whether it's Hamas or another organization that has been matched with \u2026 a clear desire by these elements to trample on the rights of other people around them,\" Edlow told CBS News during an interview at USCIS headquarters in Maryland.",
      "Pressed on whether those determinations could be based on speech protected by the U.S. Constitution, Edlow said, \"Absolutely not.\"",
      "\"People are free to make whatever statements they want on social media or anywhere else. And anyone who, you know, doesn't support the same candidate that I support. That is not what we're talking about,\" he said.",
      "\"We are talking about beyond the pale,\" Edlow added. \"We are talking about people who are actively supporting the violent overthrow of this country, or otherwise are providing material support to terrorist organizations across the world.\"",
      "Edlow said the probe into \"anti-American\" views and activities would not be the sole criteria for granting or denying applications.",
      "\"It's not the deciding factor. It's not the only factor, but it is one factor that we want to make sure that we fully understand,\" he said.",
      "Critics of the Trump administration have accused it of weaponizing U.S. immigration law to punish noncitizens for their legally protected speech.",
      "Federal courts have questioned the legality of the administration's effort to deport legal residents like Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who participated in protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza. The administration has claimed Khalil and other activists undermined U.S. foreign policy and fostered antisemitism. But those targeted and their allies have argued the government is simply penalizing them for exercising their First Amendment rights.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department announced that officials had revoked the visas of several foreign nationals who it said \"celebrated\" the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV\"",
      "Unlike its sister agencies Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, processing immigration benefits has long been the core function of USCIS.",
      "But under the second Trump administration, USCIS has placed a greater emphasis on combating immigration fraud, aggressively vetting applicants and working more closely with ICE, including to facilitate arrests at its offices across the country. This summer, the agency also announced it would hire and train its own team of armed special agents, who Edlow said are not yet on the job.",
      "The citizenship process alone has been tweaked several times by the Trump administration, which has added more questions to the civics test used to quiz applicants on U.S. history and politics, and expanded inquiries into whether applicants have \"good moral character.\"",
      "It has also restarted a long-dormant practice, known as \"neighborhood checks,\" which involves sending investigators to interview the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants. Edlow said those checks will not apply to every case due to resource constraints.",
      "Immigrant advocates argue the changes are unfairly scaring legal immigrants. But Edlow said USCIS is \"moving back to where it was supposed to be at the beginning,\" arguing that it had effectively become \"a rubber-stamping agency\" under the Biden administration. He said vetting has always been a core function of USCIS since its creation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
      "\"We are not here as a police force,\" he said. \"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns that right now create much confusion and many problems within the legal immigration system.\"",
      "Edlow argued the effort would ultimately make it easier for people to immigrate to the U.S. legally.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV \u2026 of this government,\" Edlow added. \"We want to be faster. We want to be leaner.\"",
      "No decision yet on DACA's future",
      "One of the most well-known programs administered by USCIS is the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which currently protects half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" from deportation and allows them to work in the U.S. legally. They are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to terminate DACA, arguing it was illegal. But the Supreme Court blocked the effort on technical grounds.",
      "Asked whether the second Trump administration will try to end DACA again, Edlow suggested a final decision had not been made.",
      "\"We're still engaged in conversation. Obviously there's a lot of litigation on that,\" he added. \"As that continues to play out \u2026 we'll see where we land.\"",
      "Asked why the administration had not articulated a policy position on DACA this time around, Edlow said the question should be posed to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, USCIS' parent agency.",
      "In recent years, federal courts in Texas and Louisiana have declared DACA \u2014 and the Biden administration's efforts to codify the policy \u2014 illegal. But they have allowed current recipients to continue renewing their two-year work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "The Republican-led states challenging DACA's legality, however, recently asked a federal judge in Texas to order the Trump administration to gradually terminate the policy. It's unclear when or how the judge will rule.",
      "In 2020, Edlow, then USCIS' deputy director, agreed with the GOP-led states' argument against DACA, calling it a \"de facto amnesty program.\"",
      "Pressed on whether he still believes that, Edlow said \"I do.\""

      "Cinnamon's tainted history",
      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",
      "Lead can also cause long-term health problems in adults, according to the World Health Organization, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage."

      "Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News that the video depicts a long pattern of punishment that Hamas uses against suspected collaborators with Israel.",
      "\"Hamas is killing them because they can,\" Baskin told CBS News this week. \"Hamas is a criminal organization that has ruled the Palestinian people in Gaza for almost 20 years. This is not a democratic, liberal regime.\"",
      "Baskin also explained that Palestinian militia groups that are opposed to Hamas had been armed by Israel\u00a0during the war\u00a0in an effort to weaken Hamas' power.",

      "The deal also calls for Hamas to release the remains of 28 deceased hostages, but so far it has only released the remains of 10 of those.\u00a0Another two bodies\u00a0were released by Hamas Saturday, but they are pending identification.",

      "In some cases, Mr. Trump has posted videos of the strikes to Truth Social and alleged the boats were carrying drugs, describing the deceased as \"narcotraffickers.\" The administration has justified the strikes by arguing the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels.",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" the president told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Some lawmakers have pushed back on the strikes, arguing the administration needs to get permission from Congress to attack drug cartels and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats are carrying narcotics.",
      "The attacks are taking place amid a wider military buildup in the Caribbean, as the administration pressures the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of working with drug cartels.",
      "The U.S. has deployed eight warships, fighter jets and 10,000 U.S. forces to the region. And on Wednesday, American B-52 bombers flew about 150 miles north of the coast of Venezuela, CBS News previously reported.",

He said Friday of Maduro, \"He has offered everything. He's offered everything,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're right. You know why? Because he doesn't want to f*** around with the United States.\"",
      "Maduro has denied connections to drug trafficking and accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change. Earlier this week, he said he's ready to declare a state of emergency over American \"aggression,\" and granted himself additional powers in case the U.S. \"dares to attack our homeland.\""

    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

      "\"It would have been almost impossible for Hamas to mobilize, even if they knew where all the 28 bodies were, to mobilize and get them home,\" one adviser said Wednesday.",
      "Strikingly, the adviser said the U.S. is sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas to assist in finding hostage remains. The adviser also said Turkey has offered to help search for and retrieve remains by sending in expert teams with experience rescuing people from the frequent earthquakes in the country.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz said Thursday that American personnel would be part of the effort to recover the remains of the hostages that have yet to be turned over.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

    "summary": "Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, President Trump's dealmakers in brokering the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, discuss a setback that nearly derailed the peace talks.",
    "story": [
      "Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, two of President Trump's key negotiators in brokering the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, \"felt a little bit betrayed\" by Israeli airstrikes on Qatar during peace talks last month, they said in an exclusive \"60 Minutes\" interview.",
      "Witkoff learned about the strike, which Israel said targeted senior Hamas leadership in Doha, the morning after it happened. At the time, Mr. Trump wrote on social media, \"This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me.\"",
      "\"I think both Jared and I felt, I just feel we felt a little bit betrayed,\" Witkoff told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl.",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's reaction, Kushner said, \"I think he felt like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing, and that it was time to be very strong and stop them from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests.\"",
      "According to Witkoff, Israel's strike in Qatar impeded negotiations because Qatar was the negotiators' link to Hamas.",
      "\"It had a metastasizing effect because the Qataris were critical to the negotiation, as were the Egyptians and the Turks,\" Witkoff said. \"We had lost the confidence of the Qataris. And so Hamas went underground, and it was very, very difficult to get to them.\"",
      "Finally, Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an \"agreed upon line.\" On Monday, 20 living hostages were released. Hamas has also handed over the remains of other hostages.",
      "Stahl's full report on \"The Dealmakers\" is set to air on \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday. Witkoff and Kushner discuss meeting with Hamas in person during negotiations. They also explain more about the next phase of the 20-point peace plan, which deals with disarmament, troop pullback, rebuilding and post-war governance in Gaza."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 15:43:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The skeletal remains were found during a dig at the Roman city of Mursa, located in modern-day Croatia.",
    "story": [
      "Seven fully preserved skeletons found in an ancient city in Croatia have been identified as Roman soldiers who would have lived 1,700 years ago, scientists said in a new paper.",
      "The skeletal remains were found in 2011 during a dig at the Roman city of Mursa, located in modern-day Croatia, in a water well that had been repurposed as a mass grave, said the researchers, who are from a number of European archaeological institutions. The area was conquered by Romans during the first century B.C., and the city was an \"important trade and craft center\" that bordered an active military zone, according to the paper published this week.",
      "All seven skeletons were identified as belonging to taller-than-average adult men. Four are younger adults, between 18 and 25, while the other three are middle-aged, between 36 and 50, the researchers found. All were \"robust\" but showed \"indicators of early-life stress\" such as wear on the teeth.",
      "The skeletons were placed in different positions and at different depths, the researchers said, but all appear to have been buried at the same time. The remains seem to have been \"thrown in\" shortly after death, the researchers said. The men were likely soldiers who may have participated in a 260 C.E. battle for the city or died in a skirmish afterward, according to the researchers.",
      "Several of the skeletons had injuries, including blunt-force injuries on the facial bones of one and puncture wounds on the torsos of two others that were likely caused by weapons such as arrows or spear tips, according to the paper. The wounds and their locations were determined by analysis of the skeletal remains.",
      "The researchers were also able to use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to learn more about the soldiers' day-to-day lives. They ate lots of grains, including wheat and millet, and vegetables, but little meat, the study found. Four of the skeletons underwent DNA analysis, which found that none appeared to be local to the area. One was likely from northern or Eastern Europe, while another was likely from the Byzantine Empire.",
      "Remains of Mursa have been explored by researchers for decades. Archaeologists have found a number of water wells, small pits and other evidence of civilization.",
      "Mursa was affected by a number of conflicts, the researchers said. Many occurred during the Crisis of the Third Century, an era during which Rome nearly collapsed due to civil wars, foreign invasions and economic issues, according to CBS News' partner network\u00a0BBC News. The city eventually \"ceased to exist as an urban settlement\" after attacks in 441 C.E., the researchers said."

      "Federal prosecutors accused a man in Louisiana of participating in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, then traveling to the U.S. on a fraudulent visa, according to newly unsealed court documents.",
      "Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, 33, was allegedly part of the National Resistance Brigades, the military wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a paramilitary group that has fought alongside Hamas and participated in the 2023 attack, according to the documents.",
      "Al-Muhtadi was charged with providing, attempting to provide or conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and the fraud and misuse of a visa or other documents. The charges were brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel after hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.",
      "Al-Muhtadi's phone pinged a cell tower near Kibbutz Kfar Aza at about 10:01 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, the documents said, a few hours after the attack began. Kibbutz Kfar Aza is just a few miles from Gaza's border. Sixty people were killed there, and 19 were kidnapped, the court documents said. More than 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage during the attack. The documents do not accuse al-Muhtadi of any killings or specific crimes.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel within hours of hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly submitted a U.S. visa application in June 2024, the court documents said. In the application, he said that he was not a member or representative of a terror organization, that he had no specialized skills or training, including firearm usage, and had never engaged in terrorist activities.",
      "He met with a U.S. Embassy consular official in August and entered the United States through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Sept. 12, 2024, according to the documents. He lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for several months, the documents said. Photos shared by al-Muhtadi on social media show him posing with a gun in his Tulsa apartment.",
      "In early 2025, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents located al-Muhtadi living in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he worked in a local restaurant.",
      "A person with al-Muhtadi's name and birth date was being held at the St. Martin Parish Correctional Center near Lafayette, according to online records. He was booked into the facility on Thursday. He made his initial court appearance on Friday, according to court records. Online records did not make it clear if he had a lawyer.",
      "Federal prosecutors have previously charged six senior Hamas leaders with the deaths of at least 43 American citizens on Oct. 7. Those charged included former Hamas leader\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in October 2024."

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with President Trump at the White House today.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to press President Trump not only for long range Tomahawk missiles and upgraded air defense capabilities, but also for increased intelligence sharing to help his forces inflict more damage on Russia's energy sector.",
      "A Ukrainian and a U.S. lawmaker told CBS News that Kyiv wants to purchase equipment to upgrade its existing weapons systems, including for the F-16 jets it already possesses. On Thursday, Zelenskyy also met with executives from defense firm Lockheed Martin about the F-16 aircraft, as well as missiles. He also met with Raytheon, which makes Patriot missile systems, about potential joint manufacturing.",
      "Energy supply is the less conventional weapon to be discussed Friday, and it's a key interest for Mr. Trump. CBS News confirmed the U.S. has been aiding Ukraine through intelligence support in its efforts to hit Russian energy supplies, according to sources familiar with the U.S. efforts. Energy is the main source of income for Moscow's war chest.",
      "Ahead of the cold winter months, Ukraine and Russia have been targeting each other's energy sector to deprive \u2014 or at least make more costly \u2014 the supply of heat and electricity. The Ukrainian government says that Russia has attacked the infrastructure at Naftogaz, the largest gas and oil company in Ukraine, six times this month as part of its campaign.",
      "During his Washington visit this week, Zelenskyy had meetings with U.S. energy company executives that he said had been proposed by President Trump himself. He posted on social media videos of discussions with those executives and can be heard speaking in English about liquified natural gas terminals.",
      "Zelenskyy also met with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and said that they discussed the Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy and the need to restore the facilities that were damaged in the attacks.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report on Oct. 1 that Mr. Trump had recently signed off on allowing U.S. intelligence and the Pentagon to aid Kyiv with strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Last week, the Financial Times reported that U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv had indeed already enabled strikes on important Russian energy assets far beyond the frontline.",
      "That targeting indicates a more aggressive posture by the Trump administration than its rhetoric would indicate.",
      "Asked about the Financial Times' reporting, House Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the Ukrainian attacks on refineries had reduced Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other products by almost 20%.",
      "Himes, a member of the Gang of 8, the congressional leaders who are privy to sensitive classified information, said that despite Trump's often friendly rhetoric toward Russia, his actions had not necessarily matched up.",
      "\"His rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "Energy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy, who confirmed that 20% damage figure to CBS News, tallied at least 18 Russian refineries that have been hit by at least one Ukrainian drone strike, affecting nearly half of Russian distillation capacity. This has reduced Russia's ability to export refined products and has contributed to gasoline shortages within Russia.",
      "The pain is clearly being felt by Moscow. On Sept. 30, the Russian government also announced an extension of its temporary ban on gasoline exports through the end of the year. Diesel, marine fuel and other gas oils were also banned.",
      "Mr. Trump has been mulling whether to provide long-range weapons like Tomahawks to Ukraine, which is a step former President Joe Biden did not take. Both presidents have had concerns that strikes deep inside Russian territory that are facilitated by U.S. equipment would be perceived as escalatory and trigger a Russian response that could potentially draw in the U.S. or other NATO members.",
      "Trump indicated to reporters on Thursday that he may not provide Tomahawks: \"We have a lot of them, but we need them. I mean, we can't deplete for our country. So, you know, they're very vital, they're very powerful. They're very accurate, they're very good, but we need them too.\"",
      "In the meantime, Ukraine's own offensive drone technology has rapidly developed, enabling it to strike targets well inside the Russian territorial borders. Some of the hits on energy installations have been carried out by drones, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "A lawmaker familiar with developing Ukraine policy told CBS News that Ukraine's offensive drone technology is a potential game changer. Ukraine does not need U.S. permission to use\u00a0 drones it has produced to strike Russia, but it does need U.S. permission to strike into Russia with U.S.-provided weapons. The Trump administration's decision to provide long-range targeting intelligence would allow for increased effectiveness of the Ukrainian drones, which would make it less vital for the U.S. to provide weapons for the same purpose.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that it is finally time to move in the next 30 days on the secondary sanctions bill that would further reduce Russia's ability to sell oil to buyers like India, China, and others. The bill has overwhelming bipartisan support, and a veto-proof majority, so, if it makes it to Mr. Trump's desk, he would have to sign it into law.",
      "There is also a second bill Congress being considered in the coming days that would designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for the crime of kidnapping of Ukrainian children, which could trigger further financial penalties. Republican Senators Katie Britt and Lindsay Graham as well as Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Dick Blumenthal are co-sponsoring the measure.",
      "Last week, first lady Melania Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally responded to her advocacy on behalf of Ukrainian children by promising to discuss future releases of children. Yale University investigators estimate that at least 35,000 Ukrainian children have been taken into Russia, and the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, given his direct role in the scheme.",
      "The Trump administration is hoping that the increased economic and military pressure will jumpstart the stalled diplomatic track. On Thursday, President Trump said he expected to meet again soon with Putin, perhaps in Budapest, Hungary.",
      "Ukraine remains skeptical of Putin's intentions. Ukraine's new ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, said that the massive overnight missile strike by Russia hours before Presidents Putin and Trump spoke by phone Thursday exposes \"Moscow's real attitude toward peace.\""

    "summary": "Trump weighs sending 1,000-mile range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, which could target Russian airbases and energy infrastructure across Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said he would \"speak\" with Moscow on giving Kyiv Tomahawk missiles in a thinly veiled threat.",
      "Tomahawks, Tomahawks, Tomahawks.\u00a0That\u2019s the word buzzing in the ears of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as President Donald Trump weighs providing America\u2019s precision strike missile of choice to Ukraine.",
      "Since May, Trump has bombed the Houthis in Yemen, obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and hit narco-terrorist drug boats in the Caribbean.\u00a0 Putin has to realize that Tomahawks could soon be in the skies over Russia.",
      "What can Ukraine hit with the 1,000-mile-range Tomahawks?\u00a0Start with the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan, and at least 67 Russian airbases. Tomahawks in Ukraine\u2019s hands rip open Russian energy infrastructure to precision attack with no warning.",
      "ZELENSKYY PITCHES TRUMP ON UKRAINE DRONE-FOR-TOMAHAWK MISSILE EXCHANGE AS PRESIDENT WEIGHS ESCALATION CONCERNS",
      "If Ukraine launches Tomahawks, they\u2019ll be flying as low as 100 feet, hugging the terrain, evading radar.\u00a0TLAMs can each take separate routes at 500 mph and then meet up over the Russian target for a coordinated strike.",
      "Trump is baiting Putin.\u00a0\"Hopefully, they won\u2019t need it,\" Trump said of the Tomahawks at Friday\u2019s lunch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.\u00a0Trump said he\u2019d like to \"get the war over without Tomahawks\" but then went on to describe the missiles as \"very dangerous\" and \"incredible.\"",
      "President Trump is considering giving powerful Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, a move that has gotten Russian President Vladimir Putin's attention. (Getty Images)",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory on the Tomahawks and why Trump is keeping them on the table to pressure Putin.",
      "First tested in 1972, the Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missile, or TLAM, was actually developed by the U.S. Navy during the Cold War to attack targets on land in the Soviet Union.\u00a0In case you haven\u2019t seen one up close, the Tomahawk is 20 feet long but just 21 inches wide.\u00a0 It looks like a white pole with winglets, but inside is a powerful turbo-fan engine and sophisticated guidance.\u00a0Today\u2019s Block IV Tomahawks can be retargeted in flight, and loiter over a target for hours, taking electro-optical scans and waiting for other missiles to arrive before detonating.\u00a0They carry a unitary warhead for harder targets, or dispense cluster munitions over a wide pattern to hit airfields, for example.\u00a0(Yes, there was once a nuclear TLAM variant with a 200 Kiloton warhead, but they were placed in storage in 1991 and eliminated in 2010.)",
      "The presence of Tomahawks in Ukraine will set up an almost insoluble air defense problem for Putin.\u00a0No way can Russia place air defenses at every remote gas pipeline point or cover all the airbases where planes park out in the open.",
      "TLAMs could be in Ukraine in 24 hours.\u00a0The Army Mid-Range Capability missile system is a tractor-trailer missile launcher that can be driven onto a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane.\u00a0The Army deployed TLAM launcher 8,000 miles away to North Luzon in the Philippines in under 15 hours last year for a wargame.\u00a0Trump has plenty of time.",
      "Deterring Putin.\u00a0The brutal escalation of mass attacks by Russia led Ukraine to ramp up its drone strikes on Russian energy starting in August. According to a Reuters study, Ukraine\u2019s drones have hit 18 pumping stations, plus 32 strikes on refineries. Ukraine\u2019s Liutyi drones have a range of about 600 miles and carry warheads of about 50 pounds.\u00a0Mixing in TLAMs would intensify pressure on Russian energy, Putin\u2019s single biggest source of government revenue.\u00a0Zelenskyy has called Ukraine\u2019s drone attacks on Russian energy \"the sanctions that work the fastest.\"",
      "In this handout released by the U.S. Navy, the guided-missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG 52) launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn. (U.S. Navy via Getty Images)",
      "The U.S. still has about 4,000 Tomahawks in its inventory, and new missiles like the U.S. Navy\u2019s SM-6 are already in action.\u00a0The U.S. Army deployed its new Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic weapons to Australia in August and will have its first full battery by December.\u00a0By the way, last year Japan bought 400 Tomahawks for targeting China and North Korea.",
      "Tomahawks have piled up an incredible combat record since Jan. 17, 1991, when 122 TLAMs hit Iraqi oil and command and control targets at the start of Operation Desert Storm.\u00a0Eight-hundred TLAMs were fired in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.\u00a0Over the years, Tomahawks have hit targets in Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and, of course, Iran.\u00a0On June 22, TLAMs hit above-ground \"key surface infrastructure targets\" in the nuclear complex at Isfhahan, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.\u00a0The TLAM strikes left the sprawling site visibly damaged and blackened.\u00a0\"We gave it a capper with 30 TLAMS,\" as Trump said Friday.",
      "Putin may yell and scream about Tomahawks for Ukraine.\u00a0Pay no attention.\u00a0He\u2019s grumbled about each weapon system, from F-16s to Patriots. And no, Putin does not dare escalate with nuclear weapons in Ukraine, because the wind patterns blow radiation clouds back into Russia.",
      "As Trump said Friday: \"Yeah, its escalation. But we\u2019re going to talk about it anyway.\"",

Veterans and families spent years reporting high rates of rare cancers, birth defects and chronic diseases, only to face a long fight for recognition and care. Federal investigations later found that military and health officials were slow to act, even after learning the water was unsafe.",
      "When the contamination first became public in the mid-1980s, Marine officials blamed a nearby dry-cleaning shop for leaking chemicals into the groundwater.

      "Originally, injury claims related to Camp Lejeune had a filing deadline of 1997 \u2014 long before many victims even knew about the contamination.",
      "When Congress passed the Camp Lejeune Justice Act in 2022, victims felt a wave of relief. Harris learned that her breast cancer qualified as a covered condition and filed a claim to help pay for radiation and surgery.",

The most important goal, they say, is simply to get into court \u2014 to have their cases move forward rather than remain buried in procedural bottlenecks.",

      "\"We were really happy when the bill got passed,\" she said. \"We thought finally we were going to get the justice our loved ones deserved.\"",
      "That hope, she said, has since been replaced by frustration. \"We thought we\u2019d be able to have jury trials and our voices would be heard,\" James said. \"But we\u2019ve come across so many hurdles \u2014 proving causation, no limits on attorney fees, and only one court handling hundreds of thousands of claims.\"",
      "Camp Lejeune, a North Carolina Marine Corps base, is the site of one of the worst drinking water contaminations in U.S. history. (AP)",

      "But the most important change, she said, is restoring the right to a jury trial. \"You can write it on paper, but it\u2019s not the same as hearing from the people who lived it \u2014 seeing their faces, understanding their loss.\"",
      "Her support group has become a lifeline for families struggling under the weight of illness, lost income, and grief. \"Some women have lost their homes. Others are too sick to work. It\u2019s heartbreaking,\" she said. \"But we lean on each other.\"",

      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",

      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history.

If your Privacy Mode is off, they can see when you're online, send unwanted chats, or try to join meetings outside your group, even if you're just using a free account.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "You might have noticed that in the past few months, many companies have disclosed data breaches, including Google, Dior and Allianz, and one name that appeared in most cases was Salesforce. Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale. Nearly a billion records were stolen across dozens of organizations, and now cybercriminals are extorting victims by threatening to publish the data unless hefty ransoms are paid. Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",

      "JEEP AND CHRYSLER PARENT STELLANTIS CONFIRMS DATA BREACH",
      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",

      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",

      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",

Recently, a\u00a0father lost $4 million in Bitcoin to vishing. Though\u00a0AI voice cloning has improved, it\u2019s still flawed. You can spot inconsistencies by verifying the speaker's identity. Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person. You may also consider verifying the claims through the second channel. If the person on the other side of the phone says something, you can get it confirmed by the official email to be on the safer side.",

      "A Los Angeles-based aerospace startup called Inversion Space has unveiled Arc, its first flagship spacecraft designed to deliver supplies from orbit back to Earth in record time. The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network. During an event at the company's factory, they described Arc as the next evolution of global delivery, one that starts in orbit, not on the ground.",

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

      "Why Arc's hypersonic speed could change aerospace testing",
      "Beyond rapid delivery, Arc doubles as a hypersonic testing platform. It can reach speeds over Mach 20, endure extreme heat and survive massive g-forces. Those capabilities have caught the attention of U.S. defense agencies, which are eager to improve hypersonic flight testing. Inversion's participation in the Kratos-led MACH-TB 2.0 program highlights the growing military interest in Arc's reusable design. \"Fully reusable and capable of precise landings for rapid recovery, Arc makes hypersonic testing faster, repeatable, and more affordable,\" the company said.",

Though a short circuit prevented reentry, it provided valuable data that led to Arc's development. Ray's success convinced the company to push forward with full-scale testing. Inversion has already completed dozens of drop tests and built a full-scale Arc prototype. The startup also partnered with NASA to refine the vehicle's thermal protection system for reentry.",

Imagine doctors receiving vital medical kits from orbit after a natural disaster, or soldiers getting urgent supplies in minutes instead of hours.

      "Now, fake settlement claim emails and websites are flooding inboxes. They look convincing, but behind the plain design and official-sounding language is a trap for your Social Security number, banking info and more. So how can you make sure you get your money without losing even more in the process?",

      "TOP 5 OVERPAYMENT SCAMS TO AVOID",
      "Why fake settlement sites are so convincing",
      "Settlement claim websites rarely look polished. Most have generic layouts, long URLs and simple forms asking for a claim ID from your email or postcard. That makes it easy for scammers to mimic them. To test how simple it is, we created a fake settlement site (below) in minutes using AI tools like ChatGPT.",
      "To steal your data, scammers build fake settlement sites that mimic real sites (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "If we can do it, you can bet criminals are already exploiting the same shortcuts. Facebook has been the target. A fake site once popped up around the Equifax settlement, tricking thousands before it was shut down. The lesson? If the site appears unusual, it doesn't necessarily mean it's fake, but it should prompt you to double-check before entering your details or clicking on any links.",
      "Red flags that expose fake settlement sites",
      "Spotting a scam often comes down to noticing the little details. Watch for these common warning signs before you hand over your information.",
      "If a site asks for your full Social Security number or the names of your children, stop. For example, the official Equifax settlement only requested the last six digits of SSNs. Genuine claim sites may ask for limited info (like the last four digits of your SSN), but they rarely demand complete Social Security or bank details.",
      "Real administrators calculate payments only after the claim period closes.",
      "Settlements are announced by mail or email, not through random DMs or SMS.",
      "Fraud can be found with red flags like odd URLs, urgent countdowns, or fee requests (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Even one extra letter in the web address is a sign of a spoof site. Legitimate settlements use official or clearly named administrator domains. Be wary of addresses with unusual add-ons, such as \"secure-pay\" or \"claims-pay.\"",
      "Scammers rely on urgency to pressure you into acting fast. Real settlement sites don't demand 24-hour turnarounds.",
      "A sure giveaway of a fake. Real settlement administrators never require money to file or to receive your payout.",
      "Scam sites often throw in fake \"secure\" seals. Look for recognized security seals and make sure they're clickable and verifiable.",
      "Official sites list multiple, verifiable contacts. If the email or phone number matches the weird domain, that's a red flag.",
      "Sloppy errors in legal-sounding text are a classic sign you're looking at a scam.",
      "Start with official FTC links or mailed notices to file claims safely (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Before filing any claim, follow these steps to ensure you're dealing with a legitimate settlement site and protecting your information.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission keeps updated lists of approved class action settlements at\u00a0ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds. The legitimate links always point to a .gov website. If your email sends you elsewhere, treat it with caution.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps examines usability, routing accuracy, data handling and features across the top navigation platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson discusses Instagram\u2019s new maps feature and more on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019",
      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies. In this article, we compare these three apps across usability, accuracy, features and data handling to help you determine which one best fits your needs.",

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin one day before Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and more on 'Special Report.'",
      "The term \"special relationship\" has been used to describe the U.S.-U.K. partnership since WWII in the face of Nazi, Germany, but many have argued it was solidified during the Cold War under the close alliance of President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margret Thatcher.",
      "This week former and current diplomats, government officials and foreign policy advisers convened in London to celebrate what would have been Thatcher\u2019s centennial birthday, and to reflect on her partnership and friendship with the late U.S. president.",
      "The Reagan-Thatcher alliance set a precedent that has transcended political parties and national leaders, even during periods when the U.S. and U.K. faced undeniable differences.",

      "\"They were political soul mates, in a sense. This wasn't a forced marriage,\" Fred Ryan, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the\u00a0Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ryan explained that their relationship was so successful, in part, because they had formed a relationship prior to either of them becoming heads of state, and they shared a mutual dedication to revitalizing their economies and countering communism.",
      "\"I think the personal relationship made it more than just transactional \u2013 it made it something that was a kind of a relationship of exceptional trust in terms of what it's done today,\" Ryan, who also served as Chief of Staff to\u00a0Reagan starting in the late 1980s, said. \"Going forward, I think it's set a great example.\"",
      "Though the Reagan-Thatcher alliance is most known for pressing the Soviet Union, ardent anti-communist principles and ultimately ending the Cold War, experts this week in London argued that, perhaps more significantly, their partnership created a lasting obligation that future leaders would adhere to ensure the U.S.-U.K. partnership continued.",

Actions he took upon re-entering the White House, including steep tariffs and a critical tone of NATO, had some worried he was favoring American isolationism.",
      "But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Trump have made significant efforts to keep the relationship positive.",
      "Trump has frequently referred to his mother\u2019s Scottish roots as one reason he is fond of the U.K. and Ryan argued that the U.S.-U.K. partnership is also rooted in not only its shared history, but \"built into the DNA\" of both nations, dating back to the British colonies prior to the American Revolution.",
      "\"[Both have] given extra weight to the special relationship, and it does appear to be something that they're both working at,\" Ryan said. \"People have seen that Keir Starmer [and] Donald Trump have been able to build a good relationship. It's an example for others to try to emulate.\"",
      "COULD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH PUTIN BE THE NEXT REAGAN-GORBACHEV MOMENT?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. relationship is once again under the microscope, not only because of how different Trump and Starmer are politically, but because both nations face the greatest threat to the West since the Cold War, once again emanating from Moscow.",

      "Both Thatcher and Reagan were able to form a strong relationship with the former and final leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, though the post-Cold War peace lasted for less time than the protracted geopolitical tussle following Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump has drawn raised eyebrows in his repeated attempts to diplomatically engage with Putin despite little to no action by the Kremlin chief to end his war ambitions.",
      "Security experts have questioned whether Putin is playing Trump by issuing platitudes and agreeing to meet with Trump in a show that outwardly placates the president's desire to end the war, though taking no concrete steps to actually do so.",

      "Ryan noted there are many differences in the threat the U.S. and U.K. are facing this time around from Russia, but said, \"I do think both sides realize the threat that Putin poses, and hopefully, through this close relationship that we've had, we can be united and allied in standing up to it.\"",

But let the world remember: this could have ended long ago if many around the world \u2014 from U.N. officials to so-called human rights groups like Amnesty International \u2014 had not spent two years justifying Hamas instead of confronting it.\"",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who also flew to Egypt for the signing, has faced intense criticism in the German media for allegedly seeking to bask in the victory of Trump\u2019s triumph after he imposed a weapons embargo on Israel\u2019s army. Israeli tanks are dependent on German technological parts and Merz prohibited deliveries.",
      "Writing on the website of the conservative news outlet NIUS, its editor-in-chief, Julian Reichelt, said Merz \"supplied Hamas with air support while simultaneously denying Israel the weapons it needed to fight Hamas. He withdrew support to the Jews but increased financial support for the proven Hamas front organization UNRWA, which was directly involved in the Oct. 7 attack.\" The airpower reference was Merz\u2019s decision to send humanitarian aid to Gaza via airlift deliveries. Hamas has repeatedly stolen aid that was meant for the Palestinian population.",

They\u2019re just too disorganized to put up a good fight against this bulls---.\u201d",

But we could have done this in March. We let this go on for way too long before taking a stand.\u201d",
      "Many elected Democrats did attend No Kings protests on Saturday. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., spoke to rallygoers in Boston. Schumer joined protesters in New York. Illinois Gov.

Chris Murphy, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, Mamdani and Michigan Senate candidate Mallory McMorrow.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of a lot of the old guard and bring in some fresh blood,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe have too many octogenarians and septuagenarians in Congress.\u201d"

      "Two years of war and Israeli restrictions on aid have pushed the population of Gaza to the brink of starvation, with the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declaring a famine in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City.

Not only by the times changing \u2014 \u2018Oklahoma!\u2019 is the future; his kind of music is the past \u2014 but his partner\u2019s leaving him,\u201d Linklater told NBC News in a joint interview with Hawke. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of movies about romantic breakups almost to the point that there\u2019s kind of a similarity there, but not enough films about artistic breakups, which are so complex. Because, in this case, it\u2019s not about the art. It\u2019s really about Larry\u2019s life and his addictions, his problems. He\u2019s made himself hard to work with, and it\u2019s just heartbreaking to see that relationship coming to an end.\u201d",
      "Hawke noted that \u201cthere\u2019s an intimacy to artistic relationships\u201d that is difficult to articulate.",
      "\u201cThe relationship with Rodgers is the most important relationship in his life. It\u2019s almost beyond a lover,\u201d he said of Hart, whose working relationship with Rodgers spanned more than 1000 songs. \u201cSo to lose that is to lose a huge aspect of yourself, of your professional life, of your self-esteem \u2014 it\u2019s all coming apart at its very foundations, because his whole identity is wrapped up in his relationship with Rodgers.\u201d",
      "Linklater, 65, first sent Hawke, 54, an early draft of Kaplow\u2019s screenplay a dozen years ago, but Linklater said he felt Hawke was still too young \u2014 and, as the director joked, \u201ctoo good-looking\u201d \u2014 to play Hart in the final months of his life. Every few years, they would pull out the script and workshop the dialogue, which was crafted to gradually reveal details about Hart\u2019s personal and professional lives. When the time came to finally step into Hart\u2019s shoes, after years of researching the lyricist on his own time, Hawke joked that he was \u201cstripped\u201d of all of his \u201cvanity.\u201d The nearly 6-foot actor was made to look a foot shorter; given a balding, combover haircut; and was forced to adopt a completely new diction and set of mannerisms.",
      "\u201cHim perceiving himself as diminutive in status was essential to the way he interacted with the world. There\u2019s a lot of people that talk a lot that are kind of blowhards, and they\u2019re trying to dominate. Larry\u2019s not trying to dominate. He\u2019s trying to be seen,\u201d Hawke explained. \u201cIf he\u2019s not talking, if he\u2019s not the smartest person in the room, if he\u2019s not the funniest, if he\u2019s not the most insightful, nobody notices him \u2014 that\u2019s how he feels. He feels tossed away sexually, like he\u2019s not a viable romantic interest for anyone. So things like the comb over, the bad skin, the awkward body language \u2014 all that stuff was essential to how he perceived himself so that the audience could understand who Larry was.\u201d",
      "In the April 2013 edition of The Atlantic, writer Robert Gottlieb reported that many of Hart\u2019s contemporaries knew he was gay, but he still went to great lengths to try to conceal his sexuality. While writing \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d Kaplow got ahold of 11 letters addressed to Hart from a young woman named Elizabeth, who was a student at Yale University. The screenwriter chose to dramatize that relationship by having Elizabeth (played by Margaret Qualley) show up at Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d to meet Hart, a man more than twice her age who had become infatuated with her.",
      "\u201cI found that such an interesting part because today we forget that to be gay in the \u201940s is to be underground. Your sexuality is against the f\u2014ing law. You could be arrested,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cSo even the people who worked with him, Larry\u2019s sexuality was never on the table. Rogers never referenced it.\u201d",
      "Linklater found there was something \u201ctouching but very complex\u201d about the short life of Hart, who died in 1943 at age of 48.",
      "\u201cIt was a tough time to be around, but then he was born at the right time to do what he does with his gift, to write a thousand songs. They were doing so many shows,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we benefit from that, that Larry Hart was alive at this time, but he suffered like so many because of the time he was in.\u201d",
      "Hawke said for his interpretation of Hart, \u201cthe pain of losing Rodgers is so great and so significant\u201d that \u201che can\u2019t actually absorb the impact of what\u2019s happening to him.\u201d Instead, \u201che\u2019s distracting himself with a new wound\u201d: his sexuality.",
      "\u201cHe believes that an aspect of him is heterosexual, and he could live a normal life, and he sees her as a path to rescue,\u201d Hawke said of Hart\u2019s view of Elizabeth. \u201cHe has so much work to do before he\u2019s the partner that Rodgers wants \u2014 this guy who\u2019s showing up on time \u2014 and he\u2019s not going to do that work. Elizabeth is another wonderful, glorious distraction like the alcohol.\u201d",
      "Hawke and Linklater acknowledged the irony of telling a story about an artistic breakup at a time when their own creative partnership has never been stronger. But whereas Hart and Rodgers worked only with each other for a quarter-century, Hawke said he and Linklater have \u201cbeen lucky that we are not the only well we draw water from.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve changed because having grown children changes you, time changes you, politics changes you. You have a different relationship to the community as an older person than you do as a younger person,\u201d Hawke said of how his relationship with Linklater has evolved over time. \u201cBut the thing that probably would surprise people the most, what\u2019s remarkable about it, is how consistent it\u2019s been. We started talking in 1992, and we just kept talking.\u201d",
      "Linklater concurred, adding that he and Hawke have always been \u201creally simple, in that we just want to do the work\u201d at hand.",
      "\u201cNo matter what\u2019s going on, our priority is seemingly working and making movies, expressing ourselves. I think if I had become a raging alcoholic, or vice versa, the partnership would\u2019ve drifted,\u201d Linklater said with a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that 30 years later, we\u2019re still on a similar track, I guess, until you\u2019re not. That\u2019s why this film about an artistic breakup is heartbreaking because it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh yeah, things do come to an end.\u2019\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As she runs for a U.S. Senate seat in Michigan, Democratic state Sen. Mallory McMorrow is buzzing around a state known for making cars with a unique pitch: keep bees instead.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to a manufacturing-based economy, she often warns on podcasts and at public events. McMorrow also boasts about the work she and others have done to promote apprenticeship programs and encourage less obvious career paths.",
      "She rhapsodizes about winemaking and beer brewing. And she\u2019s particularly enthusiastic about beekeeping.",
      "\u201cYou can go into a certified apprenticeship, and maybe you find out you\u2019ve always wanted to be a beekeeper and you didn\u2019t know it, and now you have a great career,\u201d McMorrow said last month in a video chat with The Common Good, a nonpartisan advocacy group.",
      "It\u2019s an approach that McMorrow describes as hopeful and forward-looking \u2014 and an alternative to what she sees as a dangerously singular focus on the auto industry, the longtime lifeblood of Michigan\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cWhen the auto industry does well, we do well. When it goes down, we go down,\u201d McMorrow, 39, said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cThat has been an Achilles\u2019 heel for us. Between that and the fact that, for millennials and Gen Z, we\u2019re not going to have the career security that our parents did, it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019re going to have to change your career multiple times throughout your working life.\u201d",
      "McMorrow\u2019s message also presents a substantial tension point in next year\u2019s Democratic Senate primary. Rep. Haley Stevens, one of her rivals for the nomination, has made Michigan\u2019s rich manufacturing history \u2014 and her work in the Obama administration on the Great Recession-era rescue plan for Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers \u2014 central to her campaign.",
      "Their race is already a study in the traditional versus the nontraditional, as one of a handful of 2026 primaries that will clarify the direction of a Democratic Party struggling to find its bearings. Stevens, a sitting member of Congress, has establishment support in her state and in Washington. McMorrow and a third candidate, physician Abdul El-Sayed, are running as outsiders. McMorrow\u2019s focus on alternative, artisanal career paths contrasts with the sensibilities of Stevens, who launched her campaign reminiscing about her first car, a used Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme \u2014 \u201ca piece of Michigan \u2026 the Michigan that helped build this country.\u201d",
      "Asked about McMorrow\u2019s focus on nontraditional apprenticeships, including beekeeping, Stevens countered that now is the time to \u201cdouble down\u201d on manufacturing.",
      "\u201cThere have always been people, pundits and speculators who have doubted Michigan manufacturing, and that is not me, and that is not the people of Michigan,\u201d Stevens, 42, said. \u201cI\u2019ll just say that we are in a really trying time right now with the current administration and the tariffs that they\u2019re putting in place, and our manufacturing sector deserves an advocate.\u201d",
      "McMorrow rejected the idea that she is disparaging manufacturing. She said she favors an \u201call-of-the-above solution\u201d and that she is optimistic about the auto industry\u2019s future. Responding to Stevens\u2019 comments, she added: \u201cI think that either/or approach has hurt us.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, McMorrow\u2019s emphasis on beekeeping and other niche apprenticeships stands out as a staple of her speeches and a subject she raises unprompted in interviews. She even acknowledges that her evangelism has echoes of \u201clearn to code\u201d \u2014 the mantra from the 2010s that was meant to promote a shift to high-tech jobs but mutated into a condescending clapback.",
      "\u201cAt one point it was \u2018learn to code,\u2019 or it was \u2018pivot to video\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s the one weird trick that\u2019s gonna fix it,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cAnd what I\u2019m trying to say in the room is there is no one weird trick, that we don\u2019t know how technology is going to change our economy and change our workforce. \u2026 So, yes, there is a little bit of a callback to \u2018learn to code,\u2019 but what I\u2019m saying is learn to find what\u2019s next for you.\u201d",
      "Michigan\u2019s count of active registered apprentices jumped 12% last year, according to a state report. But nearly 60% of those apprenticeships were concentrated across five job categories: electricians, construction laborers, carpenters, millwrights and plumbers, pipe fitters and steamfitters. While there has been an uptick in nontraditional apprenticeships, it has largely been in fields like health care and public administration.",
      "The report included no mentions of winemaking, beer brewing or beekeeping.",
      "El-Sayed, 40, agrees that such \u201ccraft\u201d apprenticeships offer career paths that are valuable to Michigan\u2019s economy, singling out cheesemaking, leather-making and knitting. He believes more should be done to ensure those jobs have higher pay, better benefits and stability.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to talk about apprenticeships,\u201d said El-Sayed, who lost a primary for governor in 2018. \u201cBut it\u2019s another to talk about the structures that enable a sustainable economy in those spaces, and I think that comes with empowering small businesses and empowering unions, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so focused on those two parts.\u201d",
      "Others, like Stevens, are less enamored with McMorrow\u2019s approach.",
      "Republicans backing former Rep. Mike Rogers for Senate would almost certainly highlight McMorrow\u2019s emphasis on such jobs if she is the Democratic nominee, said Greg Manz, a GOP strategist in Michigan.",
      "\u201cMichigan built the American middle class through manufacturing, and Republican leaders in the Great Lakes State are focused on reviving that strength \u2014 not replacing it with boutique hobbies,\u201d Manz said.",
      "McMorrow, Manz added, previewing an attack line, \u201cis throwing in the towel on family-sustaining industrial jobs, while Mike Rogers is fighting to bring them back.\u201d",
      "Adrian Hemond, a Democratic consultant in Michigan who said he is not affiliated with any of the candidates but has spoken favorably of Stevens, also criticized McMorrow\u2019s approach, saying it is geared more to \u201ccollege-educated white women\u201d than it was to blue-collar workers. He called it an \u201cabsolute, atrocious loser\u201d in a general election.",
      "\u201cTalk about beekeeping and winemaking \u2014 like, that is pitched pretty clearly at affluent Dem donors, right?\u201d Hemond added. \u201cThat has no appeal with the broader electorate, like zero. There are probably a few dozen people in Michigan who think that they might make a career beekeeping or winemaking. This is just la-la land stuff for an important, but relatively small, slice of the electorate.\u201d",
      "Michigan is home to more than 600,000 manufacturing workers, according to a recent state estimate. And a December 2024 report from MichAuto, an industry advocacy group, counted 288,000 jobs directly tied to the auto sector, with more than 1.2 million jobs directly or indirectly tied to the broader mobility industry, which includes automaking.",
      "Quantifying the number of beekeeping jobs is a tougher task. In a 2022 interview with WCMU Public Media, an expert in the field from Michigan State University estimated the number of commercial bee farms in the low hundreds.",
      "Officials with the Michigan Beekeepers Association \u2014 a group that has 800 members, most of them hobbyists \u2014 said they were delighted to learn of the apprenticeships McMorrow is championing, though they were unaware of them until reached by NBC News.",
      "Candace Casados, the association\u2019s president, said the state had 82,000 honey-producing colonies in 2024 and roughly $15 million of honey production in sales. She believes apprenticeships can help the industry grow.",
      "\u201cBeekeeping is very much an experiential field,\u201d Casados said. \u201cApprenticeships let mentors pass on their knowledge for things like disease detection, hive management, seasonal cycles and forage planning. There\u2019s so much that needs to be learned as a new beekeeper, and having that hands-on experience and knowledge and guidance under someone is just key.\u201d",
      "As of late September, there were only two registered beekeeping apprentices in Michigan, making an average hourly wage of $15.50, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The state also reported having two winemaking apprentices, at an average wage of $18.50, and one professional brewer apprentice, at a $17 wage.",
      "\u201cI bring up beekeeping as an example, mostly because it\u2019s unexpected, and it\u2019s surprising to people, and it catches people\u2019s attention,\u201d McMorrow said when asked about its tiny footprint when compared to mightier industries in Michigan.",
      "McMorrow, who has held campaign events at craft breweries across the state, said she has met brewers and others who, worried about the rise of AI and shifting economic tides, left behind jobs in the finance, tech and auto industries. Those conversations, she added, have reinforced her belief that a wider menu of apprenticeships is prudent.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming yet,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this technology is going to change our workforce. And we\u2019re going to be much more nimble and ready as a state. If you are able to pivot and get into another field, [you] may not be so susceptible to changes with AI and know that if you need to change again in another 10 years, you can.\u201d",
      "Stevens, for her part, did not explicitly criticize McMorrow by name but drew unmistakable contrasts, emphasizing her belief in manufacturing as the past, present and future.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up on manufacturing,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd we, of course, need a senator who\u2019s going to want to champion it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our skilled workforce that\u2019s going to move us forward,\u201d Stevens added. \u201cAnd so when you talk about the new technologies that over the last 50 years have caused people to doubt the prowess of our industrial base and our manufacturing sector, it is going to be our skilled workforce here in Michigan that\u2019s tied to manufacturing that will win the day.\u201d",
      "McMorrow characterized such thinking as shortsighted.",
      "\u201cI think where we have fallen short as a state,\u201d McMorrow said, \u201cis by putting all our eggs in one basket instead of recognizing we can do all of the above.\u201d"

      "Ed Gein spent the remainder of his life in Wisconsin psychiatric hospitals after confessing to a pair of murders in 1957, but did he commit another homicide while in a hospital?",
      "The Netflix series \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story\" depicts Gein, played by Charlie Hunnam, having a fatal encounter with a nurse at one of the psychiatric hospitals where he is being held.",
      "Did that really happen, or is it another fictional departure from Gein's story in the series?",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What Happens Between Ed Gein and a Nurse in 'Monster'?",
      "In the seventh of the show's eight episodes, Gein is shown crossdressing in women's lingerie while in a psychiatric hospital.",
      "A new head nurse named Roz Mahoney, played by Linda Reiter, tells Gein on her first day that there will no more crossdressing. Gein's life inspired the crossdressing Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins, in the horror classic \"Psycho.\"",
      "\"You, sir, are the most notorious killer since Jack the Ripper, so I intend to treat you like that,\" Mahoney says. \"You will be escorted by staff wherever you go.\"",
      "She also labels him \"clever\" instead of \"crazy\" and calls him a \"liar\" when he says he would never hurt her.",
      "Gein later is shown violently killing Mahoney with a chainsaw. Gein was never known to use one on the two women he confessed to killing, but he has been cited as an inspiration for iconic horror character Leatherface in \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"",
      "However, following the murder scene with the nurse, Gein is showing waking up and realizing Mahoney is alive.",
      "Her murder was just a violent hallucination, which causes Gein to suffer a breakdown.",
      "Gein is diagnosed with schizophrenia and put on medication under Mahoney.",
      "Did Ed Gein Actually Kill a Nurse at a Psychiatric Hospital?",
      "No, Gein was confined to Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Wisconsin and then later Mendota State Hospital in the same state. He was 51 years old when he admitted to his crimes and lived the next 26 years in the two hospitals.",
      "Gein pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity after being charged with first-degree murder.",
      "It's true that Gein was diagnosed with schizophrenia and endured hallucinations, according to a letter issued on Dec. 19, 1957, by officials at Central State Hospital after they questioned Gein.",
      "\"It was determined that Mr. Gein has been suffering from a schizophrenic process for an undetermined number of years and that this schizophrenic process is made apparent by what is delusional thinking,\" the report stated.",
      "\"He stated that his activities were the result of some outside force acting upon him, and that he had been chosen as an instrument of God to carry out activities which were ordained to happen,\" the report continued. \"There have been at least several incidents of olfactory, auditory and perhaps visual hallucinations in the last 12 years.\"",
      "The letter recommended Gein be committed to Central State Hospital as \"insane.\"",
      "No incidents were reported during Gein's stay in multiple psychiatric institutions. He died in 1984 at 77 years old while living in Mendota Mental Health Institute."

      "The wide application of the \"girl whatever\" trend include: Horses running by a pool, footage from a Lady Gaga concert, a skydiving expedition, or eating a burrito on a beach.

      "The social media agency @media.alacarte, which explains TikTok trends in videos, said you can \u201cuse this iconic Charli XCX song to show how you are loving life, despite everything going on around you. Because let\u2019s be honest..it was never *that* serious.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe \u2018girl whatever\u2019 trend is all about loving yourself and embracing your main character energy,\u201d creator Melanie Martinez said in a video.",

      "TikToker Lizzy Lucamai offered another take on what the trend \u201creally means.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt means escaping the ordinary and realizing that you were meant for something more,\u201d Lucamai wrote. \u201cIt means nurturing your wild woman spirit and chasing down your dream. It means leaving behind everything that is not meant for you, clearing space for the things that are.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A dispute between a high-end bakery and an online food reviewer has a mess of crumbs all over TikTok.",
      "On Oct. 7, Aurora Griffo, who posted food videos under the name \u201cGlamorama\u201d on TikTok, shared a now-deleted review of Arizona bakery JL Patisserie that sparked major backlash and, eventually, an apology.",
      "\u201cI do not mind spending 10 dollars on a pastry if they are really good, but you cannot use fake-ass ingredients,\u201d Griffo said in the controversial review, while holding a pistachio croissant. \u201cThat pistachio color is about as natural as my boobs, ass and waistline.\u201d",
      "She was similarly harsh regarding the shop\u2019s coffee, which she deemed \u201csuper sour and acidic,\u201d and its quiche, which she said had a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d crust and so much egg, she \u201cwould have eaten an omelet\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cFive dollars for a canel\u00e9? I didn\u2019t even pay that in San Tro-f---ing-pez,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the price next to the Phoenix Airport? OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",
      "Griffo did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Leurquin\u2019s response garnered a staggering 60 million views and nearly 50,000 comments.",
      "\u201cI am loving this new trend of restaurants getting publicity for outing these influencers, blackmailing businesses for a pastry,\u201d commented one TikTok user.",
      "Referring to Griffo\u2019s review, someone else said, \u201cThat was straight bullying just because she couldn\u2019t get free food.\u201d",
      "Even mega-popular food reviewer Keith Lee weighed in on the drama.",
      "\u201cWhat you do with a little is what you do with a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re gonna be honest now, and you not honest, you ain\u2019t gonna be honest when you get 100 million followers, that\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d",
      "Glamorama Responds, Then Apologizes",
      "Griffo posted a response to Leurquin, saying it was a \u201cbit of a stretch\u201d that she was bullying the bakery, since it has more followers than she does, but later deleted the video.",
      "\u201cGoddamn, someone finally stood up to me. You know, I gotta say f---ing kudos for real,\u201d Griffo said. \u201cI never said that I would leave a good review for a free meal.\u201d",
      "That video didn\u2019t go over well, either: After even more backlash, Griffo deleted all of her videos, changed her username and posted an apology.",
      "\u201cMy review was not revenge for being turned down for a collaboration I had already planned to visit and review the bakery regardless, paid or not,\u201d Griffo wrote in the text-based TikTok. \u201cBut I understand with how things unfolded, it might have looked like I did it out of spite. That\u2019s not who l am, and that was never my intention.\u201d",
      "Griffo said she gives honest reviews and the folks who have followed her \u201cfor a while\u201d know that, but understands now that \u201chonesty without compassion can come across the wrong way.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo the bakery, I\u2019m sincerely sorry for any harm my words may have caused. I respect the time, effort, and heart that goes into running a small business, and I genuinely wish you nothing but success moving forward,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. Sometimes we mess up publicly and all we can do is take accountability, learn, and grow from it.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner Speaks Out",
      "Leurquin says since her video went viral, it\u2019s \u201cthe busiest we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Leurquin tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd primarily, people have just been so nice.\u201d",
      "The baker says that people have been opting for the pistachio croissant most, of course, followed by the pumpkin croissant, an item that was on special last weekend.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my community. I\u2019m very proud that I stood up for what we do, and my team, and I think the truth spoke for itself, and the way people stood up really, truly amazed me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have ever imagined to see this in my life, truly, and I feel so blessed and amazed that people are supporting us the way they are, and people have been so nice, so patient this weekend. It\u2019s mind blowing.\u201d",
      "Leurquin also says some of the harsher backlash Griffo is receiving is not what she wishes on her.",
      "\u201cI know she is getting some death threats and stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very intense on her side but in a negative way. That\u2019s something that we never meant to have happen.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian has opened up about the \"narrative\" that she keeps her four children from seeing their father, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and how she has \"never once done that.\"",
      "The reality star and beauty mogul spoke with Alex Cooper for the Oct. 15 episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast about how she co-parents with Ye. Kardashian, 44, also spoke about what made her finally seek a divorce from the controversial rapper, the last time he spoke with their children, and why she decides to stay silent when Ye posts screeds about her online.",
      "Kardashian and Ye, who were married from 2014 to 2022, share children North, 12, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 6.",
      "\"What do you think co-parenting with Kanye West is like?\" Kardashian asked when Cooper broached the subject. \"It\u2019s not easy, but I raise the kids, full time. They live with me, and I welcome a great, healthy relationship with my kids and their dad, and I think he knows that.",
      "\"I push for it all the time, but I also protect them when it\u2019s time for that. And it goes in waves and phases, and it\u2019s a lot of work.\"",
      "Kardashian also shared the last time the children have been in contact with their father.",
      "\"Whenever he\u2019ll call for them and ask,\" she said. \"It\u2019s probably been a couple months since we\u2019ve heard from him. They always knew that he had a big life traveling before and was always on tour and all of that, and that he lives in different countries all the time and loves to live all over the place. We manage it really well.\"",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Ye for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Kardashian tries to keep her focus on her children.",
      "\"They love their life and their routine and their schedule,\" she said. \"And I think just the job as their mom is just to make sure that they stick to their routine, and they\u2019re healthy and happy.\"",
      "She also addressed the speculation that she does not let her kids see their father.",
      "\"Look, it\u2019s not easy no matter what, co-parenting with anyone. I think that the one thing that just gets me is that there\u2019s this narrative that I keep the kids away from him,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve never once done that.",
      "\"There\u2019s been so many times where I\u2019ve been like, 'Ah, I just want to show all of these texts. What are you talking about?' Like, we just haven\u2019t heard (from Ye),\" she continued. \"I beg them to go hang out or things like that.\"",
      "Ye has accused Kardashian on social media of not allowing him to see the children, which she has denied.",
      "\"It\u2019s more of just the narrative that, like, I think it\u2019s all good and we\u2019re living our life, and then I just wake up and there\u2019s all these tweets about how I\u2019ve kidnapped the kids,\" Kardashian said. \"And I\u2019m like, it\u2019s not a kidnapping, it\u2019s a divorce, you know? We can still all be in each other\u2019s lives and have group dinner.\"",
      "Kardashian said her mother, reality star Kris Jenner, says she needs to give it \"five years of being divorced\" before \"everyone can coexist and be friends.\"",
      "\"Every time he has asked, I will always let them see their father,\" Kardashian said. \"That\u2019s just who I am. If there\u2019s a time where it\u2019s just really super unhealthy, I will say, 'Hey, let\u2019s do it here at my house, or let\u2019s figure out a different time.' But actually when he is like that, he doesn\u2019t really want to see the kids a lot.\"",
      "Kardashian said Ye has lived in Saudi Arabia, Italy and Japan, and she has \"never once denied\" her children going to visit him.",
      "\"I don't keep the kids, and I think that all that narrative really sucks for me,\" she said. \"And if I spoke out about it and rebutted it, I\u2019m just not that girl online that\u2019s going to, like, fight back and be like, 'Wait a minute, your assistant and you said you wanted a whole different birthday party, and you said your party\u2019s at 4 (o'clock), so we did ours at noon, and now you\u2019re going online saying (something else).' It\u2019s just a totally different narrative than what the reality is, and that just really sucks.\"",
      "Ye has previously said derogatory things about Kardashian on social media, but she does not respond.",
      "\"There has been so many times where I\u2019ve written a draft and been like, 'I\u2019m going to go,'\" she said. \"And then I\u2019m just like, 'What\u2019s the point? What is the point? Am I going to go back and forth? My kids are going to see this.' They\u2019ll figure it all out when when they want to make those decisions. And I used to be so protective and so 'hide everything,' and then sometimes you just can\u2019t hide it all.\"",
      "\"I never say anything negative about my kid\u2019s dad just because it\u2019s out there,\" she continued. \"Like, the last thing my kids need is for them to hear it from me. And I never saw my parents talk bad about each other no matter what was going on. I do think that that\u2019s just who I am. I just don\u2019t want to go there with, like, fighting back, saying negative things, you know?\"",
      "That's not to say she hasn't thought about it.",
      "\"I wish I did last time,\" she said. \"I had a good post ready to go.\"",
      "She added that it's hard for her to stay restrained when Ye has said negative things online about her mother.",
      "\"That\u2019s what\u2019s really hard for me, because she loves him, and to this day still does and is super emotional about it and sad about it. It was a big part of our lives,\" Kardashian said. \"My kids, I say such positive things about their dad that, like, North had to say to me, 'Mom, I think you go upstairs and, like, cry at night. Like, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s time to move on. You need to have a boyfriend now.' And I\u2019m like, 'Wait, what? What? I cry? No, I'm getting a massage upstairs. What do you think is happening?'\"",
      "Kardashian also shared why she split with Ye, between him saying negative things about her mother and sisters and airing out \"personal stuff.\"",
      "\"Just not feeling safe, not even physically, just, like, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" she said, adding, \"We had, like, five Lamborghinis, and I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d all be gone if he was in an episode. And I\u2019d be like, 'Oh, wait, where\u2019s all our cars? My new car.' And it would be like, 'Oh, he gave them away to all of his friends.'\"",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get when you wake up,\" she continued. \"And that\u2019s, like, a really unsettling feeling. Lack of stability was a big thing.\""

      "\u201cThey would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep \u2014 \u2018Oh, you\u2019re awake?\u2019 \u2014 with a knife in her hand,\u201d he wrote, according to the Times. \u201cThen she\u2019d turn around and pad off without explanation.\u201d",
      "Federline said in an interview with the Times that he hasn't spoken to Spears in years, but he has become concerned about her due to what he hears from his sons.",
      "\u201cThe truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it\u2019s racing toward something irreversible,\u201d he wrote in the book, according to the Times.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become impossible to pretend everything\u2019s OK,\u201d he added, per the Times. \u201cFrom where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we\u2019re getting close to the 11th hour. Something bad is going to happen if things don\u2019t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding the pieces.\u201d",
      "Federline told the Times he had not discussed the contents of his memoir with Spears, whom he once was a backup dancer for.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never, ever, once, been against Britney,\u201d Federline said. \u201cI\u2019ve only tried to help my sons have an incredible relationship with their mother. And it\u2019s hard because when I really reflect on everything that\u2019s happened \u2014 my kids do not know the woman that I married. And I\u2019ve spent two decades trying to bridge that gap.\u201d",
      "In an Oct. 14 interview with \"Entertainment Tonight,\" Federline denied writing the memoir for money.",
      "\"I\u2019m absolutely, as a father, terrified that one day I might wake up and my sons are going to have to deal with the unimaginable,\" Federline said.",
      "In 2021, Spears was freed from her 13-year conservatorship after months of court hearings and years of public support from her fans, following several documentaries that investigated the pop star's life.",
      "Spears wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cThe Woman in Me,\u201d that while she was under the conservatorship she felt like she \u201cbecame a robot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut not just a robot \u2014 a sort of child-robot. I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,\u201d Spears wrote. \u201cThe conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child. I became more of an entity than a person onstage. I had always felt music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me.\u201d",
      "Spears' memoir is being adapted into a biopic by Universal Pictures, with \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu and producer Marc Platt attached, according to NBC News. (TODAY and Universal Pictures are owned by the same parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Spears seemingly referenced the project in a post on X in 2024.",
      "\"Excited to share with my fans that I\u2019ve been working on a secret project with #MarcPlatt. He\u2019s always made my favorite movies \u2026 stay tuned,\" she said, adding a rose and camera emoji."

      "A flow of stories about Prince Andrew\u2019s association with Epstein has dogged King Charles III\u2019s younger brother for six years, with the scandal becoming one of the most damaging in recent British royal history.",
      "Giuffre had alleged that Epstein trafficked her to his powerful friends, including Andrew, against whom she filed a lawsuit in 2021 alleging that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17.",
      "Andrew, who denies having had sex with Giuffre and any wrongdoing connected to Epstein,\u00a0stepped back from active royal duties in 2019 as controversy around his association with Epstein swirled. He agreed to settle the suit with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount in 2022 with no admission of wrongdoing.",

      "\u201cThat was the real last nail in the coffin for Andrew because it makes him look, in black and white, like a liar,\u201d said NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",

      "Israel\u2019s military earlier this week informed the U.N. it would halve the amount of aid expected to enter Gaza due to the slow release of the remains of Israeli hostages, a key point of contention between Hamas and Israel.",
      "The bodies of three hostages were returned to Israel in the last day and the ceasefire continued to hold, however, the United States issued a warning to Hamas should it try to violate the deal with an attack on Palestinians.",
      "The World Food Programme is supplying approximately 560 tons of food every day, its spokesperson, Abeer Etefa, told reporters on Friday. However, the agency is facing challenges in ramping up the quantity, as key crossings remain shut, and in its delivery, due to destroyed roads.",
      "\u201cThe first stop is that the Israelis open [these crossings]. It is very important to have these openings in the north,\u201d Jens Larke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Friday. \u201cThat is where the famine took hold.\u201d",
      "Etefa said there are only two operational crossings, and none in the north, where the crisis is the most acute.",

      "On Saturday afternoon, Israel said it had received the bodies of two hostages, leaving the bodies of 16 more in the enclave.",
      "The IDF earlier said it had received the remains of a hostage later identified as Eliyahu Margalit, 75, from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Margalit was killed in the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack and his body was taken into Gaza, the IDF said in a post on X.",

      "On Saturday, the U.S. Department of State said in a post on social media that there have been \u201ccredible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,\u201d it said.",

      "\u201cThe United States and the other guarantors remain resolute in our commitment to ensuring the safety of civilians, maintaining calm on the ground, and advancing peace and prosperity for the people of Gaza and the region as a whole,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Keeping up with food demand",
      "Two years of war and Israeli restrictions on aid have pushed the population of Gaza to the brink of starvation, with the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declaring a famine in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Israel allowed very few aid trucks in, and aid began to pile up outside the crossings.",

      "Japan's top sumo wrestlers were wandering the streets of London earlier this week ahead of the sold-out Grand Sumo Tournament currently taking place at the Royal Albert Hall, the British capital's famous Victorian concert venue.",
      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",
      "His rival, Hoshoryu, was the 74th man to attain the rank.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that sumo is back after so many years,\u201d Onosato told Sky News, NBC News\u2019 broadcasting partner, on Wednesday. \u201cI hope I can show the U.K. fans how fantastic sumo is.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",
      "Their carefully structured, high-calorie meals are vital for building the size and strength needed to compete at the highest level.",
      "\u201cWe are going through 70 kilos of rice a day,\u201d Donagh Collins, the CEO of Askonas Holt, an arts company which helped to organize the event, told Sky News. \u201cSomebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles,\u201d he added.",
      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",
      "The wrestlers, who weigh a combined six tons, slapped, gripped and lifted each other, as spectators reveled at the sight of the centuries-old Japanese sport.",
      "Around eleven tons of clay were brought into the hall to build the dohyo, the raised ring where the wrestlers compete, outlined with rice bales shaped and secured using beer bottles, according to Reuters.",
      "The two grand champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, each secured victory in their bouts, closing the evening with weighty performances \u2014 literally."

      "Despite being scattered across oceans and continents, the protests are connected by the frequent appearance of the same emblem: a pirate flag from a globally popular Japanese anime series.",

      "Frustrated by chronic power and water shortages, young people in Madagascar, an island nation off southeastern Africa, first took to the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, on Sept. 25. The protests were mobilized largely by Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group that is powered by social media.",

      "Soon, young protesters in Madagascar, where the median age is 19, were demanding the resignation of Rajoelina, 51, who came to power in a military-backed coup in 2009.",

      "According to the United Nations, at least 22 people have been killed in the Madagascar protests, a figure the government has disputed.",

      "Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit based in Brussels, said there was still a lack of clarity around how the disarmament of Hamas might actually play out.",
      "\"None of this has been spelled out \u2014 what kind of weapons, under what conditions ... none of it. None of it is on paper,\" he said. \"It is a kind of aspirational endpoint without many signposts about how to get there.\"",
      "What is clear, Hanna said in an interview on Wednesday, is that \u201cHamas is not gone.\u201d",
      "\"I mean, lots of people have said this for a long time, that Israel would not be able to eliminate or destroy Hamas, and they haven\u2019t,\" Hanna said.",
      "\"They\u2019ve probably eliminated Hamas as an actual threat to Israeli security, but in terms of Hamas in the Strip, they are still there and seemingly exercising some coherent control,\" he said, noting that some of the violence appeared to be \"tied up with clan criminality,\" including clans with \"links to Israel.\"",
      "Members of a number of clans in the enclave have clashed with Hamas over the past two years, including the Abu Shabab clan, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas has accused of collaborating with Israel. The Doghmosh clan, one of the biggest and most powerful in Gaza, has also been at odds with Hamas.",
      "Reuters reported that Hamas fighters had clashed with members of Doghmosh on Sunday and Monday, citing security sources. NBC News was not immediately able to verify that reporting.",
      "\"There are well-known clans and personalities,\" Hanna said. \"Anybody at this point who is trying to operate independently outside of Hamas authority in the places where it is present is probably going to have trouble.\"",
      "In a statement released on Tuesday following a gathering of Palestinian tribes and clans in the Gaza Strip, some clans warned that protection would be withdrawn from any members \u201cproven to be involved in any violation that threatens our societal security and civil peace.\u201d",
      "They urged groups to \u201cfully adhere to this decision\u201d to keep the peace and to \u201chand over perpetrators and violators to the competent authorities,\u201d in an apparent reference to Hamas.",
      "\"I think it was a stupid strategy for Israel to try to rely on some of these clans,\" Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of Realign for Palestine, a project of the Atlantic Council, said. \"Hamas made a name for themselves early on by basically breaking a lot of these clans and by having the ability to say we\u2019re bringing law and order.\"",
      "The gang violence in Gaza comes as peace efforts have also been complicated by Hamas' failure to return many of the 28 bodies of hostages killed in captivity.",
      "Hamas said Wednesday that the remaining bodies required \u201csignificant efforts and specialized equipment to search for and retrieve.\u201d",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz told senior Israel Defense Forces commanders to prepare a military plan to defeat Hamas if the militant group refuses to implement the U.S.-brokered peace plan, according to Katz\u2019s spokesperson."

    "story": [
      "A prominent doctor who had become a voice for besieged Palestinians in Gaza and was detained by Israeli forces in December has had his detention without charge extended, his family and legal representatives said Thursday.",
      "The family and supporters of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, had hoped he would be released under a ceasefire deal, along with dozens of medical workers who had been detained during Israel\u2019s offensive in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "According to an X post by Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, a legal group based in Gaza, an Israeli court \u201crubberstamped\u201d the extension of Abu Safiya\u2019s detention for another six months in a closed-door hearing.",
      "In a separate statement on Abu Safiya\u2019s own account, his family also said his administrative detention had been extended. Israel has not commented on the case.",
      "\u201cThere has been one shock after another, and the size of the pain is indescribable,\u201d Abu Safiya\u2019s son Elias Abu Safiya told NBC News  over WhatsApp on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can sleep while my father is worried, how I can eat while my father is hungry, and how I can live my normal life.\u201d",
      "Abu Safiya\u2019s family and supporters had hoped and expected he would be among the around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees Israel agreed to exchange for 48 hostages held by Hamas on Monday as part of a ceasefire deal.",
      "The Israeli military initially denied Abu Safiya was in its custody, but in a statement in January, it said without providing evidence he had been involved in \u201cterrorist activities\u201d and held \u201ca rank\u201d in Hamas that made Kamal Adwan Hospital a stronghold during the war.",
      "Abu Safiya\u2019s son and colleagues, including the Chicago-based nonprofit MedGlobal, which has partnered with local care workers in Gaza for years and arranges volunteer medical missions to the enclave, have rejected these allegations. Abu Safiya was the lead physician in Gaza for MedGlobal before his detention.",
      "Prior to his detention in December 2024, Abu Safiya had warned that Israeli strikes were putting patients, medics and sheltering civilians at risk, calling for the world to intervene to \u201cprotect the health care system.\u201d He refused to leave the side of his patients, even as tanks and bulldozers encircled his hospital.",
      "Abu Safiya was last seen in Gaza in December walking from Kamal Adwan Hospital toward Israeli tanks. Video verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, a lone figure in a white doctor\u2019s coat, moving through a rubble-strewn street surrounded by bombed-out buildings. The footage was believed to capture the moments before he was detained by Israeli soldiers.",
      "After detention orders in Abu Safiya\u2019s case were previously upheld by an Israeli court in March, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights maintained his innocence, saying in a news release that he was \u201csolely performing medical and administration duties at Kamal Adwan Hospital.\u201d",
      "Al Mezan says Abu Safiya reported enduring torture and inhumane living conditions to a lawyer who was previously able to visit him at Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli Prison Service told NBC News it does not provide details regarding the \u201cidentity, conditions, or legal status of prisoners and detainees.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has responded to those allegations by saying it acts in accordance with both the country\u2019s and international law and \u201cprotects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the case, the Israeli military referred NBC News to the Israeli Ministry of Justice. In a statement, the ministry said it was not responsible for determining the identity of those who are released.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Healthcare Workers Watch, an initiative that documents detentions from Gaza, had said in a news release that 55 medical workers, including 24 nurses and seven doctors, were on lists of detainees from Gaza expected to be freed. It could not immediately confirm whether all were.",
      "At least 115 medical workers remained in Israeli custody, as well as the remains of four who died while in Israeli custody, it said in the news release on Monday.",
      "More than 9,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli prisons, according to data published by HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organization.",
      "Many of them are being held under \u201cadministrative detention,\u201d according to the organization \u2014 a practice in which Israeli authorities hold people without trial or other usual legal proceedings, often based on alleged secret evidence they often do not share with detainees, their families or legal representatives. Their fates are among the questions not addressed in President Donald Trump\u2019s plan.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rest easy nor look ahead to the colossal task of rebuilding Gaza\u2019s shattered health system until he and all of our health colleagues are safely home,\u201d Joseph Belliveau, MedGlobal\u2019s executive director, said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday."

      "Gaza is now gone, Shadi Abu Sido, 35, shouted to the cameras as he emerged from a bus in the southern city of Khan Younis on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a scene from 'Judgment Day,'\u201d he said of the destruction.",
      "Later, he was reunited with his wife and children, who he said his captors had falsely told him had died.",
      "Abu Sido is among 1,718 Palestinian detainees released in exchange for Israeli hostages, in addition to 250 security prisoners convicted of serious crimes including murder. The detainees, taken captive since the Hamas terror attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, had faced no charges. All 20 surviving Israeli hostages held in Gaza were released under the exchange.",

In prison, he says he was left handcuffed and blindfolded for weeks.",
      "\"No food, no bathroom, no talking, no lifting your head,\" he said. Those who disobeyed were \"hung on the wall and beaten,\" he added.",

It was every single person that we talked to that had the same stories. It was truly horrifying.\u201d",
      "She said that three people who had been imprisoned for months arrived at the hospital with fresh gunshot wounds that appeared to have \u201chappened within the span of the last three weeks.\u201d",
      "Israel also returned the bodies of 120 detainees. On Thursday, the Ministry of Health in Gaza posted photos of what it said were bodies returned showing signs of torture and with various toes and fingers missing.",

      "RIGA, Latvia \u2014 They\u2019re dotted on dozens of buildings across the Latvian capital: signal green signs with white stick figures of a family and the word \u201cpatvertne,\u201d which means shelter.",
      "Installed everywhere from art deco buildings to wooden gates, the signs alert people to places to hide in the event of an attack \u2014 and have become one of many symbols of war preparedness in this charming city, which is crisscrossed with canals and looks nervously east at its Russian neighbor.",
      "After a string of recent aircraft incursions along NATO\u2019s eastern flank and suspicious drones shutting down airports in several European countries including Germany, Denmark and Norway, fears about Russian aggression are growing in Latvia and its fellow Baltic nations, Estonia and Lithuania, already spooked by Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe are on the front line. We are the eastern flank countries. We are neighboring Russia, an aggressive country,\u201d Andris Spr\u016bds, Latvia\u2019s defense minister, told NBC News earlier this month at the Riga Conference, a meeting of international political and military leaders.",
      "He added that Latvia, which launched a drone initiative earlier this year, had to some extent \u201calready developed some resilience\u201d in the face of any Kremlin aggression.",
      "Other attendees openly talked about a direct conflict between NATO and Russia. In an onstage discussion at the conference, Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to the organization, publicly theorized with his fellow panelists about weapons systems, including long-range missiles and strategic bombers, that could be used against the Kremlin\u2019s forces.",
      "But he also emphasized that modern warfare begins before troops and military hardware are deployed.",
      "\u201cThe first shot of the next war is not going to be tanks through the Suwalki Gap,\u201d he said in a separate interview with NBC News, referring to the narrow land bridge between Poland and the Baltic states, seen as a potential attack point in a Russian invasion. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a cyberattack. It\u2019s going to be knocking out airports or critical infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Latvia and other Baltic countries have been very receptive to recent NATO initiatives and are on track to reach defense spending targets soon, he said, adding that they were \u201cinvesting in things that are going to field more capabilities for our defense and deterrence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe investments that make each individual ally stronger and therefore the collective alliance stronger are the important investments, and a country like Latvia is certainly doing it best in class right now,\u201d he added.",

      "Ukraine, he said, lacked air power and strong naval assets, adding that NATO fighter jets had been carrying out missions over the Baltics from the USS Gerald Ford after it was deployed to the North Sea earlier this year.",
      "Others, like Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, openly acknowledged that it took \u201cway too long\u201d for other nations to listen to Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, which were occupied by the Soviet Union for decades and more recently have been at the forefront of pushing NATO allies to take the Russian threat seriously.",
      "Airis Rikveilis, the national security adviser to Latvia\u2019s Prime Minister Evika Silina, said his country was not only focusing on increasing military capabilities, but also on preparing civil society for conflict.",
      "\u201cThis is not going to be 1940,\u201d he said, referring to the first Soviet occupation, when the Red Army was able to take over within weeks. \u201cShould that battle start tomorrow, we\u2019ll be ready to fight tomorrow with what we have,\u201d he added.",
      "After Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, there have been visible changes across Latvia, which has installed a fence along its 176-mile border with Russia. It has also cut itself off from the shared power grid with Russia and Kremlin ally Belarus, which sits to Latvia\u2019s south, and is now relying on energy from its other neighbors.",
      "In Riga, officials have demolished the 260-foot victory memorial dedicated to the Soviet army and renamed the road where the Russian Embassy is located to Ukrainian Independence Street.",
      "The blue street sign sits at the corner building next to the embassy\u2019s CCTV cameras and under its large flag. Dozens of Ukrainian flags fly in the square just across the road.",
      "Linda Ozola, who served as Riga\u2019s deputy mayor for five years until this summer, oversaw the rebuilding of the shelter network, among other civil protection measures. She said her staff had to scout museums and archives for old documents, as well as reinspect old shelter spaces, some of which had fallen into disrepair.",
      "Emergency services have identified hundreds of existing shelters, and updated legislation has cleared the way to build new ones. Their locations are available on a website and cellphone app.",
      "Some of them will likely be funded by an 85 million euro ($99.4 million) deal signed on the sidelines of the Riga Conference by Arvils A\u0161eradens, Latvia\u2019s finance minister, and European allies. The majority of that funding will be used to enhance the civil protection infrastructure, and some will also be used to install generators at health care facilities.",
      "Ozola said the city has also started to build up a stock of emergency supplies including canned food and sleeping cots. Riga has been an example for the other regions of Latvia and could also be one for cities across Europe, she said.",

And the neighbor is not hiding that, really,\u201d she said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t physically crossed the border, but they have crossed the airspace and they have cut our critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.\u201d"

      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he expects to meet next week with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to try to forestall an escalation of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that President Donald Trump said was unsustainable.",
      "Bessent made the announcement during a White House cabinet meeting and later confirmed plans for a meeting after a call with He on Friday evening. Bessent said on X the two officials \"engaged in frank and detailed discussions regarding trade between the United States and China.\"",
      "\"We will meet in-person next week to continue our discussions,\" Bessent wrote.",
      "China state news agency Xinhua reported that He and Bessent had \"candid, in-depth, and constructive discussions on major issues in bilateral economic and trade relations\" in a video call, and agreed to a new round of trade talks as soon as possible.",
      "The two officials previously met in four European cities over six months to hammer out a tariff truce that brought duties down from triple-digit levels for each country. That agreement expires on November 10.",
      "A meeting in Malaysia would shift the venue to a Southeast Asian exporter that trades heavily with both China and the U.S. and whose goods are now subject to a 19% duty imposed by Trump. Malaysia also faces a threatened 100% U.S. tariff on its semiconductors and derivative electronics devices under a national security trade review.",
      "Trump earlier on Friday blamed Beijing for the latest impasse, a dispute over China's sweeping new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals and magnets. He has threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on November 1 unless Beijing scraps the restrictions.",
      "Asked whether such a high tariff was sustainable and what that might do to the U.S. economy, Trump replied: \"It's not sustainable, but that's what the number is.\"",
      "\"They forced me to do that,\" he said in an interview with Fox Business Network that was broadcast on Friday.",
      "Trump also has threatened to impose new U.S. export controls that would halt supplies of \"any and all critical software.\"",
      "The new trade actions were Trump's reaction to China dramatically expanding its export controls on rare-earth elements. China dominates the market for such elements, which are essential to tech manufacturing.",
      "Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday blasted the restrictions as a threat to global supply chains.",
      "Trump also confirmed he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in two weeks in South Korea and expressed admiration for the Chinese leader.",
      "\"I think we're going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It's got to be fair,\" Trump said on FBN's \"Mornings with Maria,\" which was taped on Thursday.",
      "Later, as he was preparing to have lunch at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss efforts to end its war with Russia, Trump said: \"China wants to talk, and we like talking to China.\"",
      "The softening in tone and affirmation of his intent to meet with Xi helped stem Wall Street's early losses on Friday. Major U.S. stock indexes, which have been rattled over the last week by Trump's abrupt re-imposition of steep levies on Chinese imports and by credit worries among regional banks, were up in afternoon trading.",
      "The head of the World Trade Organization urged the U.S. and China to de-escalate trade tensions, warning that a decoupling by the world's two largest economies could reduce global economic output by 7% over the longer term.",
      "WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters in an interview the global trade body was extremely concerned about the latest spike in U.S.-China trade tensions and had spoken with officials from both countries to encourage more dialogue.",
      "But tensions continued to run high, even as Trump and Xi prepared to meet.",
      "Bessent took aim at China's state-driven economic practices in a statement to the IMF's steering committee on Friday, urging the IMF and World Bank to take a tougher stance on China's external and internal imbalances and industrial policies that U.S. officials say have helped China build up excess manufacturing capacity that is flooding the world with cheap goods.",
      "And China's Commerce Ministry on Friday accused the U.S. of undermining the rules-based multilateral trading system since the Trump administration took office in 2025, vowing to intensify its use of dispute settlement actions at the WTO.",
      "It also urged the U.S. to roll back measures that breach non-discrimination rules and align its industrial and security policies with WTO obligations.",
      "Bessent earlier in the week had accused one of He's top aides of being \"unhinged\" in recent interactions with U.S. trade negotiators. China said on Friday that Bessent's remarks \"seriously distort the facts.\""

      "Britain's Prince Andrew will stop using his Duke of York title after facing fresh questions over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Andrew, King Charles III's younger brother, said in a statement issued via Buckingham Palace that he would \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me.\"",
      "The decision was taken \"in discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family,\" he said, after concluding that \"the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.",
      "\"As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" Andrew said.",
      "His former wife, Sarah Ferguson, will no longer be known as the Duchess of York.",
      "Andrew stepped back from public duties in 2019 and returned his military affiliations and later royal patronages in January 2022, after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse.",
      "He later paid a substantial sum to Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41.",
      "Giuffre's family on Friday called the decision a \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\"",
      "\"This decisive action is a powerful step forward in our fight to bring Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s child sex-trafficking network to justice,\" Giuffre\u2019s family said.",
      "Friday's decision comes after the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday newspapers published an email, not verified by NBC News, reported to have been sent by Andrew to Epstein in 2011, after a photograph was published showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre.",
      "\"We are in this together,\" the newspapers reported that the email read. \"Play some more soon.\"",
      "The palace did not respond to an NBC News request for comment on the email.",
      "Andrew has previously said that he broke off all contact with Epstein in 2010. In a disastrous interview on the BBC\u2019s \"Newsnight\" program in November 2019, he said he had visited Epstein's New York home that year with the purpose of ending their friendship.",
      "Last month, a 2011 email surfaced from Ferguson to Epstein describing the disgraced financier as a \"supreme friend,\" just weeks after she had publicly distanced herself from him.",
      "The duchess was \u201ctaken in\u201d by Epstein\u2019s lies, her spokesperson said. \u201cAs soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with pedophilia.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson said Ferguson stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. \u201cThis email was sent in the context of advice the Duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats,\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "Epstein was found dead by suicide in 2019 while he was awaiting a trial on sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "The return of Epstein to the headlines in the United Kingdom  comes just weeks after Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, was fired over his own connections to Epstein. He denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Giuffre's family on Friday called for King Charles III to remove Andrew's title as prince, which could only be changed by a formal process known as a Letters Patent.",
      "Forcibly removing Andrew's dukedom would require an act of parliament.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there\u2019s only one of us telling the truth, and I know that\u2019s me,'\" her family said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\""

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that Budapest could host a second summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine was celebrated by Hungary\u2019s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n on Friday.",
      "\u201cBudapest is essentially the only place in Europe today where such a meeting could be held, primarily because Hungary is almost the only pro-peace country,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told state radio, according to The Associated Press. \u201cFor three years, we have been the only country that has consistently, openly, loudly and actively advocated for peace.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who has maintained his far-right populist rule for 15 years, also suggested that his opposition to Western nations supplying military and financial aid to Ukraine had played a role in his capital being selected as the site for the talks.",
      "While details of the agenda are yet to be finalized, in an earlier post on X, Orb\u00e1n said preparations were underway and his landlocked country was \u201can island of PEACE.\u201d",
      "Trump announced his second meeting this year with Putin on Thursday, the day before he was set to sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.",
      "\u201cI believe great progress was made with today\u2019s telephone conversation,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social after his call with the Russian leader, adding that he hoped the Budapest summit would end the \u201cinglorious war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who is expected to push for more military support, including long-range Tomahawk missiles that could be used to strike deep inside Russia, said the talks showed Putin was on the defensive. \u201cWe can already see that Moscow is rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X shortly after the summit was announced.",
      "Trump and Putin met in Alaska for a highly anticipated summit on ending the war in August. But their three-hour meeting did not result in any movement toward peace, and Russia has continued to bombard cities across Ukraine on an almost nightly basis since then.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal for three-way talks with Putin and Zelenskyy also failed to materialize.",
      "The Budapest summit is expected to take place after talks next week between teams led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.",
      "For Orb\u00e1n who is facing pressure at home over high food prices, health care and a poorly performing economy, \u201cit is an interesting distraction from those things,\u201d according to Emily Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Hungary \u201cis a country that doesn\u2019t normally have such a level of international clout, so, for Orb\u00e1n, this is a bit of an outsized role he is playing in foreign policy here,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday.",
      "\u201cThere aren\u2019t a huge amount of places where Putin could comfortably meet Trump in Europe,\u201d Ferris said, pointing to the fact that the Russian leader faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for the \u201cwar crime\u201d of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia \u2014 an allegation denied by Moscow.",
      "Hungary is a signatory to the ICC, which is based in the Netherlands, meaning that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government would be required to arrest Putin if he set foot on Hungarian soil. After a visit in April by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also faces a warrant from the ICC on suspicion of crimes against humanity, Orb\u00e1n said he would start the process of withdrawing from the court.",
      "Hungary\u2019s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a press briefing Friday that his country would receive Putin \u201cwith respect, host him, and provide the conditions for him to negotiate with the American president.\u201d",
      "However, Ferris cautioned that the summit could backfire on Orb\u00e1n, who is widely considered to be Putin\u2019s closest partner in the European Union and who has already been criticized for continuing to purchase oil and natural gas from Russia.",
      "Hungarian officials have insisted that geographical and infrastructural constraints make it nearly impossible for Hungary to transition to using fossil fuels supplied from the West. But earlier this month, Trump called on all NATO countries, including Hungary, to cease purchasing Russian oil, since he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if they did so.",
      "\u201cIf Hungary, if it\u2019s not already, is seen as just giving a platform for a Kremlin narrative on Ukraine, that could be quite damaging,\u201d Ferris said."

      "Israel has accused Hamas of operating in civilian areas, thus necessitating attacks that endanger noncombatants. In November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, whom Israel said it had killed, over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
      "Israel has forcefully rejected the allegations, and Netanyahu\u2019s office branded the decision \u201cantisemitic,\u201d rejecting them as \u201cabsurd and false\u201d and condemning the ICC as a \u201cbiased and discriminatory political body.\u201d",
      "Tinged with sadness",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged many Israelis\u2019 public pain in comments on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, our sons will return to their borders,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a historic event that is tinged with sadness over the release of murderers \u2014 and joy over the return of kidnapped people.\u201d",
      "Under President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point plan for ending the fighting, Hamas fighters who lay down their weapons would be spared any punishment \u2014 a condition that has also raised grave reservations among many Israelis, including Netanyahu, who had hoped to see Hamas destroyed.",
      "Rachel Goldberg-Polin, an American Israeli whose son, Hersh, was kidnapped on Oct. 7 and then killed by Hamas last year, said she\u2019s rejected the feelings of anger that come with grief.",
      "\u201cNothing can bring Hersh back,\u201d she said in an interview last week. \u201cI tend to look at this in a very zoomed-out way. I don\u2019t have this fiery venomous anger that I think wouldn\u2019t serve me in any purpose.\u201d",
      "Avni, who opposed this week\u2019s deal, said he worries that the released convicts will simply return to the battlefield or engage in terrorism against Israelis.",
      "\u201cObviously, every single Jewish person wants to get the hostages back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that strategically trading thousands of terrorists for 20 lives makes sense.\u201d",
      "Avni has advocated executing terrorists as a way to remove prisoner exchanges from the negotiating table. Israeli law allows for capital punishment, but only for treason and \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d The death sentence has been used only twice in Israeli history.",
      "In the hours after his father\u2019s murder, Avni admits that he considered taking matters into his own hands. Both Lakin and Abu Ghanem were taken to the same ward in the same Jerusalem hospital after the attack.",
      "The two men were treated only yards apart. Lakin died, but his killer survived.",
      "\u201cI think I would have jumped on him and done something but he had police standing there,\u201d Avni said. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, you know, you\u2019ll go to jail for life, and you\u2019ve got responsibilities.\u201d",
      "Recounting the cruel irony of his father\u2019s killing still brings tears to Avni\u2019s eyes. His father had been a peace-loving school principal who advocated for racially integrated education, had marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and participated in the anti-segregation \u201cFreedom Riders\u201d movement during the 1960s.",
      "The family moved to Israel when Avni was 15 years old.",
      "\u201cHe was a big believer in coexistence. I wish everybody could be like that, but they\u2019re not,\u201d Avni said of his father. \u201cIt was an innocent world view.\u201d",
      "Matt Bradley reported from Caesarea and Daniele Hamamdjian  from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank."
