      "Refugee children in Kenya's Kakuma camp are turning to dance to cope with harsh conditions",
      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",
      "They make their sharp synchronized moves that they have been perfecting for months.",
      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",
      "The center, which previously featured daily programs such as taekwondo and ballet, may not be operational in a few months if the funding landscape remains as is.",
      "\u201cWe are now reducing some of the activities because we are few. The staff are few and even per day we only have one staff remaining in the center and it is really hard for him/her to conduct 500 children,\u201d said John Papa, a community officer for Terre des hommes in Kalobeyei Village 3.",
      "These programs do more than entertain the children \u2014 they keep them away from issues such as child labor, abuse and crime which as a major concern for humanitarian organizations in Kakuma.",
      "And as the children dance and play beneath the sweltering sun, the only hope is that these child friendly spaces remain operational for years.",

      "The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "Channel 156 has been SiriusXM Fight Nation, which has carried pro wrestling, MMA and boxing shows.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d said Dave LaGreca, the longtime host of \u201cBusted Open,\u201d which started as a one-hour weekly show in 2009. \u201cI really owe it to our fans. They've really been dedicated and asked for this for years. It's a dream come true to actually see it form. And now, it's about to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cBusted Open\u201d expanded to five days a week in 2018 before going to six days one year later. It will have a live episode seven days a week from 9 a.m.-noon EDT on the new channel featuring LaGreca with wrestling stars Bully Ray, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer.",
      "The show has appealed to fans of both WWE and AEW with video clips of interviews getting plenty of engagement on social media.",

      "Five nights a week there will be a \u201cBusted Open After Dark\u201d program, where fans can call in and react after WWE and AEW shows.",
      "\u201cThe great thing is we're not associated with WWE or AEW, so we can give our honest opinion about both products,\u201d said LaGreca, who signed a multi-year extension with SiriusXM. \u201cThe fact that there is a little bit of tension between those two companies and even the fans, it makes it even better for what we\u2019re doing on air. The fact that there are more companies that are succeeding at record-breaking levels is even better for our brand, and the big reason why we\u2019re going 24/7.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",

      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know.

      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \u201cBobby is a stellar example of the statement \u2018to protect and serve.\u2019 We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\u201d",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \u201cTeen Idols Tour\u201d with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman\u2019s Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman\u2019s performances: \u201cDressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with \u2018Easy Come, Easy Go.\u2019 As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\u201d",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children\u2019s Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\u201cEven in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That\u2019s who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\u201d Poublon wrote.",

      "Actor Damson Idris' career is about to hit turbo speed",
      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

      "Mick Ralphs, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died",
      "Mick Ralphs, a guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died.",
      "A statement posted to Bad Company's official website Monday announced Ralphs' death at age 81. Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for the next warm weather season encoded the geography of summer in textures, geometrical designs and his signature relaxed silhouettes.",
      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",
      "The showroom was awash in Mediterranean blue and featured installations of obsidian black stones, reflecting the sophisticated color palette that included washed-out desert shades, the palest green, deep blues and urban blacks and gray.",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",

      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",

      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",

There's a reference to her in \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d she's been mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and if you look carefully at the PBS show \u201cAlma's Way,\u201d you can see a Dora doll in that heroine's bedroom.

      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "The University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy tackles some serious topics like how to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma",
      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "The United Nations in New York received a 3.3-meter (10 foot, eight inch) diameter \u201cSphere Within Sphere\u201d sculpture as a gift from Italy in 1996. The U.N. sphere has refers to the coming of the new millennium, the U.N. said: \u201ca smooth exterior womb erupted by complex interior forms,\u201d and \u201ca promise for the rebirth of a less troubled and destructive world,\u201d Pomodoro said of it.",
      "Other spheres are located at museums around the world and outside the Italian foreign ministry, which has the original work that Pomodoro created in 1966 for the Montreal Expo that began his monumental sculpture project.",
      "Pomodoro was born in Montefeltro, Italy, on June 23, 1926. In addition to his spheres, he designed theatrical sets, land projects and machines. He had multiple retrospectives and taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mills College, according to his biography on the foundation website.",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

State health officials say they are determining the vaccination status of people being held at the facility and are providing testing kits and equipment.",
      "As of Friday, the U.S. has 1,227 measles cases nationwide as of Tuesday, including active outbreaks in 12 states.",
      "The highly contagious and vaccine-preventable illness has been spreading in New Mexico since February, starting first in Lea County \u2014 just across the border from the epicenter of the historic Texas outbreak that has sickened 750 people since late January.",
      "New Mexico had 81 confirmed measles cases Tuesday, with Thursday's announcement bringing the total to 86. One state resident died of measles in March. The adult was unvaccinated and did not seek medical care.",
      "\u201cThe cases at Luna County Detention Center are a stark reminder that the measles outbreak in New Mexico is not over,\u201d said Dr. Chad Smelser, a medical epidemiologist with the New Mexico Department of Health. \u201cWe urge everyone in New Mexico, especially Luna County residents, to ensure that they are fully vaccinated against measles.\u201d",

      "Pablo Montoya, the facility's warden, said in a statement that the first signs of illness started a week ago and all five incarcerated people who tested positive are now in quarantine. All in-person visits are suspended and court hearings will be held virtually.",
      "New Mexico has seen a large increase in measles vaccinations since February. More than 37,500 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had been administered as of Monday, state data shows, compared to about 19,300 in the same timeframe of 2024.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s vaccine advisers are bringing up an old flu-shot debate: whether it\u2019s time to wipe out the last small fraction of those vaccines that contain a controversial preservative called thimerosal.",
      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",
      "Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion will unnecessarily raise doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.",
      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

      "Global efforts to protect children against diseases like measles, polio and tuberculosis have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly infections",
      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cIt is in everyone's interest that this situation is rectified,\u201d said Dr. David Elliman, a pediatrician who has advised the British government, in a statement. \u201cWhile vaccine-preventable infectious diseases occur anywhere in the world, we are all at risk.\u201d",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve probably ordered more MRIs than I ever have in 25 years in the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's to make sure we\u2019re getting it right for the (coaching) staff, for the kids, for the kid's family. There\u2019s that much more riding on it.\u201d",
      "A former Penn State football team doctor, Scott Lynch, alleged in 2019 that coach James Franklin attempted to interfere with medical decisions.",
      "A Penn State internal review found evidence of \u201cfriction\u201d between Lynch and Franklin but could not determine whether Franklin violated NCAA bylaws or Big Ten standards by interfering with medical decisions. Lynch was awarded $5.25 for wrongful termination by the hospital that had employed him.",
      "Dr. David McAllister, head team physician at UCLA who has been practicing for 27 years, said the relationship between team doctor and athlete has gone from one built on trust to now being transactional and at times adversarial.",
      "When athletes spent four or five years at the same school, as once was the norm, friendships were formed and the team doctor continued to provide care for the some athletes long after their playing days. Now, McAllister said, many football and basketball players are taking advice from agents and business managers whose priority is the athlete\u2019s earning power, and that puts pressure on team physicians.",
      "\u201cThere are seasoned, experienced people that do what I do who either recently got out of it or are really considering it because they don\u2019t want to be exposed to the liability,\u201d McAllister said, \u201cand they don\u2019t find it that much fun anymore.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The FDA previously has said that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",

      "An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America in a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit heat that hasn\u2019t been seen in some places in more than a decade",
      "NEW YORK -- An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.",
      "The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",
      "\u201cIt will be a shock to the system,\u201d she said.",

      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the companies have been unwilling to compromise, so I think any step in the direction of standardization is encouraging,\u201d she said.",

      "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth",
      "The number of abortions in the U.S. rose again in 2024, with women continuing to find ways to get them despite bans and restrictions in many states, according to a report out Monday.",
      "The latest report from the WeCount project of the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access, was released a day before the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended nearly 50 years of legal abortion nationally for most of pregnancy.",
      "Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they are pregnant.",
      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",

Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",

      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",

Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "A hard-right lawmaker has replaced Greece\u2019s migration and asylum minister amid a political shake-up",
      "Athens, Greece -- A hard-right lawmaker has replaced a fellow right-winger and political heavyweight accused of fraud as migration and asylum minister in Greece\u2019s government, a government spokesman announced Saturday.",
      "Thanos Plevris, 48, is succeeding Makis Voridis, 60, who resigned Friday to defend himself against allegations that he was possibly involved in an organized fraud scheme to provide farm subsidies to undeserving recipients.",
      "The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which has investigated the case, passed on a hefty file to the Greek Parliament that includes allegations of possible involvement of government ministers. Members of Parliament enjoy immunity from prosecution in Greece that can only be lifted by parliamentary vote.",
      "In his resignation letter, Voridis denied acting illegally and said he is resigning to clear his name. He noted that during his tenure as agricultural development and foods minister from July 2019 and January 2021, he capped individual subsidies and launched a record number of investigations. His detractors say those very actions are proof that he was aware of the corrupt subsidies system and did nothing to reform it.",
      "On Friday, four other lawmakers, three of whom had formerly served as deputy ministers in the Agricultural Policy Ministry, as well as a current deputy minister, also resigned. Their replacements were also announced Saturday by government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis, who added they will be sworn in Monday.",
      "No changes are expected to be seen in Greece\u2019s tough migration policy under Plevris who, like Voridis and current health minister Adonis Georgiadis, joined the conservative New Democracy in 2012, leaving the right-populist Popular Orthodox Rally, or LAOS.",
      "Before LAOS, Voridis had been the leader of the youth wing of the far-right National Political Union, appointed to the post by jailed former dictator George Papadopoulos. He had replaced Nikos Michaloliakos, who went on to found the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party and who is currently serving a prison term for leading what courts termed a \u201ccriminal gang.\u201d",
      "Voridis founded his own far-right party, Hellenic Front, and took part in several municipal and national elections between 1994 and 2004. In 2000, he allied himself with Plevris\u2019 father Konstantinos, a lawyer, far-right activist and self-styled \u201cproud fascist.\u201d Voridis joined LAOS in 2006 and has been a lawmaker since 2007.",
      "Voridis is considered a political heavyweight and, if not for his far-right and sometimes violent past, he would have been considered a possible conservative leader, politicians and pundits agree. He now describes himself as an economic liberal and a \u201cnon-extreme\u201d nationalist.",

      "On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Sudanese military leader Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and asked him for a week-long ceasefire in El Fasher to allow aid delivery. Burhan agreed to that request, according to an army statement, but it\u2019s unknown whether the RSF would agree to that truce.",
      "A.H. said aid distribution often provided slight relief. His wife in children live in Obeid and also struggle to secure enough food due to high prices in the market.",
      "His poem continued: \u201cYou were a world that sends love into the barren time. You were a woman woven from threads of the sun. You were the sandalwood and the jasmine and a revelation of green, glowing and longing.\"",
      "Sudanese agricultural minister Abu Bakr al-Bashari told Al-Hadath news channel in April that there are no indicators of famine in the country, but there is shortage of food supplies in areas controlled by the paramilitary forces, known as RSF.",
      "However, Leni Kinzli, World Food Programme Sudan spokesperson, said 17 areas in Gezeira, most of the Darfur region, and Khartoum, including Jebel Aulia are at risk of famine. Each month, over 4 million people receive assistance from the group, including 1.7 million in areas facing famine or at risk, Kinzli said.",
      "The state is suffering from two conflicts: one between the Rapid Support Forces and the army, and another with the People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North, who are fighting against the army and have ties with the RSF, making it nearly impossible to access food, clean water, or medicine.",
      "He can\u2019t travel to Obeid in North Kordofan to be with his family, as the Rapid Support Forces blocked roads. Violence and looting have made travel unsafe, forcing residents to stay in their neighborhoods, limiting their access to food, aid workers said.",
      "A.H. is supposed to get a retirement pension from the government, but the process is slow, so he doesn\u2019t have a steady income. He can only transfer around $35 weekly to his family out of temporary training jobs, which he says is not enough.",
      "Hassan, another South Kordofan resident in Kadugli said that the state has turned into a \u201clarge prison for innocent citizens\u201d due to the lack of food, water, shelter, income, and primary health services caused by the RSF siege.",
      "International and grassroots organizations in the area where he lives were banned by the local government, according to Hassan, who asked to be identified only by his first name in fear of retribution for speaking publicly while being based in an area often engulfed with fighting.",
      "So residents ate the plants out of desperation.",
      "\u201cYou would groan to give life an antidote when darkness appeared to us through the window of fear.,\u201d A.H. wrote in his poem. \"You were the light, and when our tears filled up our in the eyes, you were the nectar.",
      "Vu warned that food affordability is another ongoing challenge as prices rise in the markets. A physical cash shortage prompted the Norwegian Refugee Council to replace cash assistance with vouchers. Meanwhile, authorities monopolize some markets and essential foods such as corn, wheat flour, sugar and salt are only sold through security approvals, according to Hassan.",
      "Meanwhile, in southwest Sudan, residents of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, rely on growing crops, but agricultural lands are shrinking due to fighting and lack of farming resources.",
      "Hawaa Hussein, a woman who has been displaced in El Serif camp since 2004, told the AP that they benefit from the rainy season but they\u2019re lacking essential farming resources such as seeds and tractors to grow beans, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and weika \u2014 dried powdered okra.",
      "Hussein, a grandmother living with eight family members, said her family receives a food parcel every two months, containing lentils, salt, oil, and biscuits. Sometimes she buys items from the market with the help of community leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are many families in the camp, mine alone has five children, and so aid is not enough for everyone \u2026 you also can\u2019t eat while your neighbor is hungry and in need,\u201d she said.",
      "El Serif camp is sheltering nearly 49,000 displaced people, the camp\u2019s civic leader Abdalrahman Idris told the AP. Since the war began in 2023, the camp has taken in over 5,000 new arrivals, with a recent surge coming from the greater Khartoum region, which is the Sudanese military said it took full control of in May.",
      "\u201cThe food that reaches the camp makes up only 5% of the total need. Some people need jobs and income. People now only eat two meals, and some people can\u2019t feed their children,\u201d he said.",
      "In North Darfur, south of El Fasher, lies Zamzam camp, one of the worst areas struck by famine and recent escalating violence. An aid worker with the Emergency Response Rooms previously based in the camp who asked not to be identified in fear of retribution for speaking with the press, told the AP that the recent wave of violence killed some and left others homeless.",
      "Barely anyone was able to afford food from the market as a pound of sugar costs 20,000 Sudanese pounds ($33) and a soap bar 10,000 Sudanese pounds ($17).",
      "The recent attacks in Zamzam worsened the humanitarian situation and he had to flee to a safer area. Some elderly men, pregnant women, and children have died of starvation and the lack of medical treatment, according to an aid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he's fearful of retribution for speaking publicly while living in an area controlled by one of the warring parties. He didn't provide the exact number of those deaths.",
      "He said the situation in Zamzam camp is dire\u2014\u201cas if people were on death row.\u201d",
      "Yet A.H. finished his poem with hope:",
      "\u201cWhen people clashed and death filled the city squares\u201d A.H. wrote \u201cyou, Koro, were a symbol of life and a title of loyalty.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Thailand\u2019s capital demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra",
      "BANGKOK -- Hundreds of protesters gathered in Thailand\u2019s capital on Saturday to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, part of the brewing political turmoil set off by a leaked phone call with former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.",
      "Paetongtarn faces growing dissatisfaction over her handling of a recent border dispute with Cambodia involving an armed confrontation May 28. One Cambodian soldier was killed in a relatively small, contested area. The clash set off a string of investigations that could lead to her removal.",
      "Protesters held national flags and signs as they occupied parts of the streets around the Victory Monument in central Bangkok. A huge stage was set up at the foot of the monument as participants sat and listened to speakers who said they gathered to express their love of the country following the intensified border row.",
      "Many of the leading figures in the protest were familiar faces who were part of a group popularly known as Yellow Shirts, whose clothing color indicates loyalty to the Thai monarchy. They are longtime foes of Paetongtarn\u2019s father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.",
      "Their rallies at times turned violent and led to military coups in 2006 and 2014, which respectively ousted the elected governments of Thaksin and Paetongtarn\u2019s aunt, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.",
      "Outrage over the recorded phone call mostly revolved around Paetongtarn telling Hun Sen, the current Cambodian Senate president and a longtime friend of her father, not to listen to \u201can opponent\u201d in Thailand. It\u2019s believed to be a reference to the regional Thai army commander in charge of the area where the clash happened, who publicly criticized Cambodia over the border dispute.",
      "Hun Sen on Saturday vowed to protect his country\u2019s territory from foreign invaders and condemned what he called an attack by Thai forces last month.",
      "At a 74th anniversary celebration of the foundation of his long-ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party, Hun Sen claimed the action by the Thai army was illegal when it engaged Cambodian forces. He said the skirmish inside Cambodian territory was a serious violation of country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, despite Cambodia's good will in attempting to resolve the border issue.",
      "\u201cThis poor Cambodia has suffered from foreign invasion, war, and genocide, been surrounded and isolated and insulted in the past but now Cambodia has risen on an equal face with other countries. We need peace, friendship, cooperation, and development the most, and we have no politics and no unfriendly stance with any nation,\u201d Hun Sen said in front of cheerful thousands of party members at the event in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh.",
      "There is a long history of territorial disputes between the countries. Thailand is still rattled by a 1962 International Court of Justice ruling that awarded Cambodia the disputed territory where the historic Preah Vihear temple stands. There were sporadic though serious clashes there in 2011. The ruling from the U.N. court was reaffirmed in 2013, when Yingluck was prime minister.",
      "The scandal has broken Paetongtarn's fragile coalition government, costing her Pheu Thai Party the loss of its biggest partner, Bhumjaithai Party. There already was a rift between Bhumjaithai and Pheu Thai Party over reports Bhumjaithai would be shuffled out of the powerful Interior Ministry.",
      "Several Bhumjaithai leaders also are under investigation over an alleged rigging of last year's Senate election in which many figures who are reportedly close to the party claimed a majority of seats.",
      "The departure of Bhumjaithai left the 10-party coalition with 255 seats, just above the majority of the 500-seat house.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces investigations by the Constitutional Court and the national anti-corruption agency. Their decisions could lead to her removal from office.",
      "Sarote Phuengrampan, secretary-general of the Office of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, said Wednesday that his agency is investigating Paetongtarn for a serious breach of ethics over the phone call with Hun Sen. He did not give a possible timeline for a decision.",
      "Reports said the Constitutional Court can suspend Paetongtarn from duty pending the investigation and could decide as early as next week whether it will take the case. The prime minister said Tuesday she is not worried and is ready to give evidence to support her case.",
      "\u201cIt was clear from the phone call that I had nothing to gain from it, and I also didn\u2019t cause any damage to the country,\u201d she said.",
      "The court last year removed her predecessor from Pheu Thai over a breach of ethics. Thailand\u2019s courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are considered a bulwark of the country\u2019s royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",

      "PARIS -- Few Paris addresses conjure myth quite like Maxim\u2019s, the gilded Belle \u00c9poque haunt where artists and aristocrats once jostled for a seat at dinner, and a place immortalized in Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics and classic Hollywood films as the very symbol of Parisian chic. On Friday night, at Paris Fashion Week the renowned restaurant-turned-nightclub became the improbable stage for Kenzo\u2019s latest co-ed show \u2014 a riot of pop color, celebrity and cultural collision served tableside.",
      "Guests perched around white tablecloths as Nigo, the first Japanese designer to helm Kenzo since the late, great Kenzo Takada, set out to prove the house can still surprise. What unfolded was a knowingly playful mash-up of preppy classics and off-kilter eveningwear: eye-popping pink dresses loosely gathered and knotted, each one tossed with a Left Bank silk scarf; a slinky tuxedo jacket paired with a blaring urban-printed tee in wild color, topped with a cartoon bunny in intentional clash. Think cocktail hour by way of Shibuya street style.",
      "Tongue-in-cheek references ran rampant \u2014 a circus master\u2019s striped waistcoat here, sheeny tiger-motif pants there, all nodding to Kenzo\u2019s signature mix of high craft and subcultural wink. If the goal was to recapture the house\u2019s historic sense of fun, Nigo went all in.",
      "While the creativity on display was undeniable, the sheer abundance of ideas sometimes made it hard for a single vision to shine through. With so many bold references and layers echoing recent seasons\u2019 spirit of collaboration and eclecticism, the collection sometimes felt more like a lively collage than a focused statement. Still, there were moments where the craftsmanship and playful accessories truly stood out, offering glimpses of the distinct Kenzo spirit that Nigo has made his own.",
      "Since joining Kenzo, Nigo has brought a fresh spirit of collaboration and cross-cultural exchange, most visibly in his headline-grabbing work with Pharrell Williams at Louis Vuitton and his frequent partnerships with artists from across the globe. That outward-looking energy has helped pull Kenzo back into the pop-culture conversation, blending the house\u2019s playful legacy with new momentum. As part of the LVMH stable, Kenzo now enjoys the reach and resources of the world\u2019s largest luxury group, giving Nigo freedom to experiment, push boundaries and reawaken the brand\u2019s irreverent roots.",
      "It was a night that nodded to both past and future. After a string of worn years under the previous design duo, Kenzo seems determined to shake off old dust and reclaim its seat at Paris\u2019 most storied table. The show at Maxim\u2019s \u2014 equal parts fashion circus and cultural memory \u2014 was a reminder that Paris style is best served with a wink, a clash and more than a little mischief.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- A deal signed in Washington on Friday has been touted as a major step toward peace in Congo following decades of conflict that has killed millions, including thousands this year.",
      "The U.S.-mediated agreement is between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is backed by neighboring Rwanda, and it is not clear if it will abide by the deal as the group wasn't part of the negotiations.",
      "President Donald Trump says the deal gives the United States \u201ca lot of the mineral rights\u201d from Congo. His administration has pushed to gain access to minerals key to much of the world's technology and is seeking to counter China, a key player in the region where the U.S. presence and influence have eroded.",
      "Both the Congolese and Rwandan presidents are expected in Washington in a few weeks to \u201cfinalize the complete protocol and agreement,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.",
      "Here's a look at what we know about the agreement:",
      "The agreement details general expectations but is short on how it will be implemented, particularly in getting the key actors of the conflict \u2014 the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels \u2014 to lay down their arms, according to a copy seen by The Associated Press.",
      "The deal emphasizes the two neighboring countries' sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, with a commitment to halt all hostilities and any support for armed groups.",
      "Although it denies supporting the M23 rebels, Rwanda has said it is protecting its border and going after the ethnic Hutus, whom it accuses of participating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide and now working with Congolese forces after fleeing to the neighboring country.",
      "Armed gangs involved in the conflict may be reintegrated into Congolese security forces only after individual vetting based on loyalty, fitness and human rights records, the deal says.",
      "In what the U.N. has called \u201cone of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth,\u201d the deal includes a commitment to protect and facilitate humanitarian access for displaced people in Congo, estimated to be more than 7 million.",
      "The two countries also commit to creating an economic framework \u201cto expand foreign trade and investment derived from regional critical mineral supply chains,\u201d including ones that \u201clink both countries, in partnership, as appropriate, with the U.S. government and U.S. investors.\u201d",
      "Analysts say it is going to be difficult for the M23 rebels to withdraw from the cities they seized during their major advance this year and that such withdrawal may either take a long time or another round of fighting.",
      "Rwanda is estimated to have thousands of troops supporting the M23 rebels in eastern Congo. Even if Rwanda ends its support for the rebels, the M23 has been consolidating its grip in the cities it has seized, setting up local administrative offices and enforcing a new governing structure.",
      "A team of U.N. experts said in a report in December that Rwanda was benefitting from minerals \u201cfraudulently\u201d exported from areas in the region under the control of the M23. Rwanda has denied involvement.",
      "The rebels were not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and have not spoken publicly about the deal. And Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance, which includes the M23, told the AP in March that \u201canything regarding us which are done without us, it\u2019s against us.\u201d",
      "Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe pointed to separate talks happening in Qatar that are meant to get both Congo and the M23 rebels to agree among themselves how they will end the fighting. He also said Rwanda agreed to lift its \"defensive measures.\u201d It was not clear if he meant withdrawing the troops that Rwanda has said are defending its territorial interests.",
      "Of five people that the AP spoke to in the conflict-battered region, none of them was convinced the deal would quickly end the fighting.",
      "They called for caution in granting the U.S. access to the region\u2019s minerals \u2014 resources that even late Pope Francis had reprimanded developed countries for exploiting to the detriment of the Congolese.",
      "\u201cWe draw the attention of the Congolese government not to give in completely or to sell the Congo to the Americans just because the United States has supported us in restoring peace,\u201d said Hangi Muhindo, a resident of Goma, the city at the center of the conflict.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has renewed his call for unity within the Catholic Church",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV doubled down on Friday on his appeal for unity in the polarized Catholic Church, urging priests to act in communion with their superiors and be models of reconciliation in a world driven by conflicts and divisions.",
      "Leo appealed for unity in a triptych of messages to priests who are celebrating a special Holy Year week in Rome dedicated to clergy. He hosted a special meeting on Thursday afternoon, celebrated an ordination Mass on Friday morning and also delivered a written message to priests around the world.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Leo ordained 32 new priests and recalled his appeal for unity during his installation Mass right after his May 8 election.",
      "\u201cToday, I share this desire once more with all of you,\u201d he said. He quoted St. Augustine \u2013 the inspiration of his Augustinian religious order \u2013 in repeating the words he said on the night of his election: \u201cFor you I am a bishop, with you I am a Christian.\u201d",
      "During the meetings that preceded the conclave that elected the first American pope in history, cardinals made clear their hope that the next pontiff would heal some of the divisions within the church that deepened during the late Pope Francis\u2019 radical 12-year pontificate.",
      "Francis\u2019 progressive social justice priorities, his informal style, liturgical looseness and disdain for the capitalist economic system often alienated conservatives, particularly in Leo's native United States, who begged for a new pope who could pacify divisions.",
      "Leo\u2019s consistent reference to unity in the church suggests he has heard those appeals and is working to respond.",
      "In a message to priests around the world Friday, Leo offered encouragement in his appeal for unity, not a browbeating as Francis often gave priests.",
      "\u201cIn a world marked by growing tensions, even within families and ecclesial communities, priests are called to promote reconciliation and foster communion,\u201d Leo said. He added that priests should not be afraid of their own weaknesses. \u201cThe Lord does not look for perfect priests, but for humble hearts that are open to conversion and prepared to love others as he himself loved us,\u201d he said.",
      "He gave a similar message Thursday to thousands of priests who gathered in a Vatican-area auditorium for a Jubilee rally that ended with Leo giving English-language shoutouts to priests from various parts of the world, including his native Chicago.",
      "In the encounter, Leo acknowledged the \u201ccrisis\u201d in priestly vocations, which have been falling consistently in traditionally Christian parts of the world for years even as the overall global Catholic population grows.",
      "According to Vatican statistics, there were 407,730 priests globally at the end of 2022, down 142 from the previous year. Europe saw the greatest decline, losing 2,745 priests \u2014 a figure that was only compensated for globally by the addition of 1,676 priests in Africa and 1,160 in Asia.",
      "\u201cThank you for who you are, and remind everyone that it\u2019s beautiful to be a priest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t perfect, but we are friends of Christ \u2026 and that\u2019s enough.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- British counter terrorism police said Friday that they have arrested four people in connection with a break-in at a military base last week, during which two planes were vandalised.",
      "Counter Terrorism Policing South East said in a statement that two men, 24 and 36, from London were arrested Thursday along with a 29-year-old woman of no fixed address \"on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.\"",
      "A 41-year-old woman, of no fixed address, was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.",
      "They remain in police custody.",
      "The arrests relate to a break-in at the Royal Air Force base in Brize Norton, during which two planes were damaged with red paint. The pro-Palestinian activist group Palestine Action subsequently released video footage appearing to show one of the two activists who entered the base spraying the paint into a jet\u2019s turbine engines.",
      "The group alleged that Britain was continuing to \u201csend military cargo, fly spy planes over Gaza and refuel U.S./Israeli fighter jets,\u201d and condemned the country as \u201can active participant in the Gaza genocide and war crimes across the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, the British government said it will ban Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws. The measure means it will be a criminal offense to belong to or support the group, with a maximum of 14 years in prison.",
      "The group has sought to press its point with high-profile direct action, perhaps most notably in March when it targeted one of U.S. President Donald Trump's golf resorts in Scotland, painting \u201cGaza is Not For Sale\u201d in giant letters on the lawn in response to his proposal to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population.",
      "The government said a draft order for the ban will be laid in Parliament next week. Lawmakers still need to approve it.",
      "Britain's government has proscribed about 80 organizations, including Hamas and al-Qaida, and far-right groups such as National Action.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces launched 363 Shahed and decoy drones as well as eight missiles at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian air force said Friday, claiming that air defenses stopped all but four of the drones and downed six cruise missiles.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said that 39 Ukrainian drones were downed in several regions overnight, including 19 over the Rostov region and 13 over the Volgograd region. Both regions lie east of Ukraine.",
      "Long-range drone strikes have been a hallmark of the war, now in its fourth year. The race by both sides to develop increasingly sophisticated and deadlier drones has turned the war into a testing ground for new weaponry.",
      "The Ukrainian air force said that 359 incoming drones were either intercepted or electronically jammed.",
      "The Ukrainian attack forced three Russian airports to briefly suspend flights, officials said. The authorities also briefly closed the Crimean Bridge overnight as drones targeted Crimea.",
      "Neither Russia nor Ukraine reported any major damage or casualties in the attacks.",
      "Russia manufactures Shahed drones based on an original Iranian model, churning out thousands of them at a plant in the Tatarstan region. It has upgraded the Shaheds with its own innovations, including bigger warheads.",
      "They are known as suicide drones because they nosedive into targets and explode on impact, like a missile. The incessant buzzing of the propeller-driven Shahed drones is unnerving for anyone under its flight path because no one on the ground knows exactly when or where the weapon will hit.",
      "Being outgunned and outnumbered in the war against its bigger neighbor, Ukraine also has developed its own cutting-edge drone technology, including long-range sea drones, and has trained thousands of drone pilots.",

      "BERLIN -- German lawmakers voted Friday to suspend family reunions for many migrants, part of a drive by the new conservative-led government for a tougher approach to migration.",
      "Parliament's lower house voted 444-135 to suspend the possibility of family reunions for two years for migrants who have \u201csubsidiary protection,\u201d a status that falls short of asylum.",
      "At the end of March, more than 388,000 people living in Germany had the status, which was granted to many people fleeing Syria's civil war.",
      "New Chancellor Friedrich Merz made tougher migration policy a central plank of his campaign for Germany\u2019s election in February. Just after he took office in early May, the government stationed more police at the border and said some asylum-seekers trying to enter Europe\u2019s biggest economy would be turned away.",
      "The bill approved Friday is the first legislation on migration since Merz took office. It will suspend rules dating to 2018 that allowed up to 1,000 close relatives per month to join the migrants granted limited protection, with authorities making case-by-case decisions on humanitarian grounds rather than granting an automatic right for reunions.",
      "Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told lawmakers that the change would result in 12,000 fewer people being able to come to Germany each year and \u201cbreak a business model\u201d for smugglers.",
      "People often know they won't get full recognition as refugees, \u201cbut they set off for Germany because it is known that, even without asylum recognition ... you can have your family follow,\" Dobrindt said. \"That is a significant pull effect and we are removing this pull effect today.\u201d",
      "Dobrindt said \u201cour country's capacity for integration simply has a limit.\u201d",
      "Liberal opposition lawmakers decried the government's approach. Marcel Emmerich, of the Greens, described the legislation as \u201can attack on the core of every society, on a truly central value \u2014 the family.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants integration must bring families together,\u201d he said.",
      "The far-right, anti-migration Alternative for Germany described the move as a very small step in the right direction.",
      "German governments have for years faced pressure to curb migration as shelters across the country filled up. The administration of Merz's predecessor, Olaf Scholz, already had taken some measures including the introduction of checks on all Germany's borders.",

      "An M23 spokesman, Oscar Balinda, also echoed those thoughts in an interview with AP this week, saying the U.S.-facilitated deal does not concern the rebels.",

      "WASHINGTON -- At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.",
      "Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.",
      "Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.",
      "Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.",
      "A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.",
      "There are scores of business-related tax cuts.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.",
      "Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.",
      "The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.",
      "The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.",
      "For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.",
      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.",
      "There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.",
      "Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.",
      "All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.",
      "The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Fund to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.",
      "In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.",
      "A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.",
      "The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d",
      "There's a new excise tax on university endowments, restrictions on the development of artificial intelligence and blocks on transgender surgeries. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.",
      "Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.",
      "The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.",
      "Also, the interior secretary would be directed to sell certain Bureau of Land Management acreage to provide for housing. The sale of public lands would cover at least 600,000 acres and up to 1.2 million acres, according to a projection from the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group.",
      "Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.",
      "The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.",
      "Or not, depending on how one does the math.",
      "Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.",
      "Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Democrats and others say this is \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.",

      "The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline.",
      "Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks.",
      "The 940-page bill was released shortly before midnight Friday. Senators were expected to take a procedural vote Saturday to begin debate on the legislation, but the timing was uncertain and there is a long path ahead, with at least 10 hours of debate time and an all-night voting session on countless amendments.",
      "Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.",
      "\u201cIt's evolving,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., as he prepared to close up the chamber late Friday.",
      "The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump's party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up, even as he sometimes gives mixed signals, allowing for more time.",
      "At recent events at the White House, including Friday, Trump has admonished the \u201cgrandstanders\u201d among GOP holdouts to fall in line.",
      "\u201cWe can get it done,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cIt will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country.\u201d",
      "The legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire by year's end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350 billion to national security, including for Trump's mass deportation agenda.",
      "But the spending cuts that Republicans are relying on to offset the lost tax revenues are causing dissent within the GOP ranks. Some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nation's debt, are pushing for steeper cuts.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he is concerned about the fundamentals of the package and will not support the procedural motion to begin debate.",
      "\u201cI'm voting no on the motion to proceed,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pushing for deeper cuts, said he needed to see the final legislative text.",
      "The release of that draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the bill to ensure it complied with the chamber\u2019s strict \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Trump\u2019s bill.",
      "Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals were determined to be out of compliance by the chief arbiter of the Senate's rules. One plan would have shifted some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states; a second would have gutted the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.",
      "The final text includes a proposal for cuts to a Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary objections and opposition from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25 billion fund to aid rural hospitals and providers.",
      "Most states impose the provider tax as a way to boost federal Medicaid reimbursements. Some Republicans argue that is a scam and should be abolished.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that under the House-passed version of the bill, some 10.9 million more people would go without health care and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The CBO has not yet publicly assessed the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions.",
      "Top income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the poorest Americans would face a $1,600 tax increase, the CBO said.",
      "One unresolved issue remains the so-called SALT provision, a deduction for state and local taxes that has been a top priority of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states. The cap is now $10,000.",
      "The White House and House Republicans had narrowed in on a plan for a $40,000 cap, but for five years instead of 10. Republican senators says that's too generous. At least one House GOP holdout, Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, said he cannot support the compromise.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what\u2019s in it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no good reason for Republicans to chase a silly deadline,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who sent his colleagues home for the weekend with plans to be on call to return to Washington, said they are \u201cvery close\u201d to finishing up.",
      "\u201cWe would still like to meet that July Fourth, self-imposed deadline,\u201d said Johnson, R-La.",

      "It\u2019s been illegal to smoke in restaurants, bars and public buildings since a series of bans in 2007 and 2008. Ever-higher taxes mean a pack now costs upwards of 12 euros ($14).",
      "Yet more than 30% of French adults still smoke cigarettes, most of them daily, one of the higher rates in Europe and globally. The Health Ministry is particularly concerned that tobacco remains popular among young people, citing public health statistics showing that 15% of 17-year-olds smoke. Black market cigarette trading is common.",
      "More than 200 people in France die each day of tobacco-related illness, Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said in a statement Saturday. That adds up to some 75,000 deaths per year.",
      "In a Paris park as the ban loomed, views were mixed.",
      "Parisian Natacha Uzan welcomed the end of smoking in restaurants. But she said: \u2019\u2019Now outside, in parks, I find it becoming a bit repressive.\u201d",
      "The broader ban is a \u2018\u2019good thing'' for Anabelle Cermell, mother of a 3-month-old boy. \u2018\u2019I tell myself, oh, it\u2019s really not ideal for him, but there\u2019s not much I can do about it, or I would have to ... not take the bus, not go to parks.\u201d",
      "The government said last month that the new ban would take effect July 1. The official decree introducing the ban was published Saturday, and a health minister\u2019s statement said that a government order specifying the perimeters set by the ban would be published in the coming days.",
      "Electronic cigarettes are exempt from the new ban.",

      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has signed legislation that provides public funding to renovate Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,\u201d Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.",
      "Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Diamondbacks, praised the governor and said the team will now turn its attention to extending its lease with Maricopa County.",
      "The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.",
      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",
      "The Oakland A's, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

      "Starlink\u2019s lightweight, high-speed internet system has rapidly spread across the Amazon, a region that for decades struggled with slow and unreliable connectivity. But the service has also been adopted by criminal organizations, which have used it to coordinate logistics, make payments and receive alerts about police raids.",
      "It's the first agreement of its kind aimed at curbing such use following years of pressure from Brazilian authorities.",
      "Starlink, a division of Musk's SpaceX, will begin requiring identification and proof of residence from all new users in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region starting in January. The company will also provide Brazilian authorities with user registration and geolocation data for internet units located in areas under investigation.",
      "If a terminal is confirmed to be used for illegal activity, Starlink has committed to blocking the service. The deal is for two years and can be renewed.",
      "Illegal gold mining has contaminated hundreds of miles of Amazon rivers with mercury and disrupted the traditional lives of several Indigenous tribes, including the Yanomami. Starlink, which first arrived in the region in 2022, has enabled criminal groups to manage mining operations in remote areas, where logistics are complex and equipment and fuel must be transported by small plane or boat.",
      "\u201cThe use of satellite internet has transformed the logistics of illegal mining. This new reality demands a proportional legal response. With the agreement, connectivity in remote areas also becomes a tool for environmental responsibility and respect for sovereignty,\u201d federal prosecutor Andr\u00e9 Porreca said in a statement.",
      "Illegal gold miners and loggers have always had some form of communication, mainly via radio, to evade law enforcement.

      "The U.S. and China have reached an agreement \u2014 again \u2014 to deescalate trade tensions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The United States and China have reached an agreement \u2014 again \u2014 to deescalate trade tensions. But details are scarce, and the latest pact leaves major issues between the world's two biggest economies unresolved.",
      "President Donald Trump said late Thursday that a deal with China had been signed \"the other day.'' China's Commerce Ministry confirmed Friday that some type of arrangement had been reached but offered few details about it.",
      "Sudden shifts and a lack of clarity have been hallmarks of Trump's trade policy since he returned to the White House determined to overturn a global trading system that he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "He's been engaged for months in a battle with China that has mostly revealed how much pain the two countries can inflict on each other. And he's racing against a July 8 deadline to reach deals with other major U.S. trading partners.",
      "The uncertainty over his dealmaking and the cost of the tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers and usually passed on to consumers, have raised worries about the outlook for the U.S. economy. And although analysts welcomed the apparent easing of tensions with China, they also warned that the issues dividing Washington and Beijing are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday that the Chinese had agreed to make it easier for American firms to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals critical for manufacturing and microchip production. Beijing had slowed exports of the materials amid a bitter trade dispute with the Trump administration.",
      "Without explicitly mentioning U.S. access to rare earths, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that \u201cChina will, in accordance with the law, review and approve eligible export applications for controlled items. In turn, the United States will lift a series of restrictive measures it had imposed on China.''",
      "The Chinese have complained about U.S. controls on exports of advanced U.S. technology to China. But the ministry statement did not specifically say whether the United States planned to ease or lift those controls.",
      "In his interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria,\u201d Bessent mentioned that the United States had earlier imposed \u201ccountermeasures'' against China and \u201dhad held back some vital supplies for them.''",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing here is a de-escalation under President Trump\u2019s leadership,'' Bessent said, without spelling out what concessions the United States had made or whether they involved America's export controls.",
      "Jeff Moon, a trade official in the Obama administration who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy, wondered why Trump hadn\u2019t disclosed details of the agreement two days after it had been reached.",
      "\u201cSilence regarding the terms suggests that there is less substance to the deal than the Trump Administration implies,\u2033 said Moon, who also served as a diplomat in China.",
      "The agreement that emerged Thursday and Friday builds on a \"framework'' that Trump announced June 11 after two days of high-level U.S.-China talks in London. Then, he announced, China had agreed to ease restrictions on rare earths. In return, the United States said it would stop seeking to revoke the visas of Chinese students on U.S. college campuses.",
      "And last month, after another meeting in Geneva, the two countries had agreed to dramatically reduce massive taxes they'd slapped on each other's products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S.",
      "Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In Geneva, the two countries agreed to back off and keep talking: America\u2019s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China\u2019s to 10%. That led to the talks in London earlier this month and to this week's announcement.",
      "If nothing else, the two countries are trying to ratchet down tensions after demonstrating how much they can hurt each other.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and China appear to be easing the chokeholds they had on each other\u2019s economies through export controls on computer chips and rare earth minerals, respectively,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"This is a positive step but a far cry from signaling prospects of a substantial de-escalation of tariffs and other trade hostilities.''",
      "Trump launched a trade war with China in his first term, imposing tariffs on most Chinese goods in a dispute over China's attempts to supplant U.S. technological supremacy. Trump's trade team charged that China was unfairly subsidizing its own tech companies, forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market and even engaging outright theft of trade secrets.",
      "The squabbling and negotiating of the past few months appear to have done little to resolve Washington's complaints about unfair Chinese trade practices and America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $262 billion last year.",
      "This week's agreement \u201cincludes absolutely nothing related to the U.S.\u2019s concerns regarding China\u2019s trade surplus or non-market behavior,'' said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201dIf the two sides can implement these elements of the ceasefire, then they could begin negotiations on issues which generated the initial escalation in tensions in the first place.''",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has made aggressive use of tariffs. In addition to his levies on China, he has imposed \"baseline'' 10% taxes on imports from every country in the world . And he's announced even higher taxes \u2014 so-called reciprocal tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% \u2014 on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit.",
      "But after financial markets sank on fears of massive disruption to world trade, Trump suspended the reciprocal levies for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate reductions in their barriers to U.S. exports. That pause lasts until July 8.",
      "On Friday, Bessent told Fox Business Network that the talks could extend beyond the deadline and be \u201cwrapped up by Labor Day\u2019\u2019 Sept. 1 with 10 to 12 of America's most important trading partners.",
      "Trump further played down the July 8 deadline at a White House press conference Friday by noting that negotiations are ongoing but that \u201cwe have 200 countries, you could say 200 countries-plus. You can't do that.\u201d",
      "Instead of new trade deals, Trump said his administration would in coming days or weeks send out a letter where \u201cwe're just gonna tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States.''",
      "Separately, Trump took sudden aim at Canada Friday, saying on social media that he's immediately suspending trade talks with that country over its plan to impose a tax on technology firms next Monday. Trump called Canada's digital services tax \u201ca direct and blatant attack on our country.\u201d",
      "The digital services tax will hit companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It will apply retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion bill due at the end of the month.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said all major banks passed this year\u2019s stress tests, showing they can withstand a hypothetical severe economic downturn",
      "NEW YORK -- All the major banks passed the Federal Reserve's annual \u201cstress tests\" of the financial system, the central bank said Friday, but the test conducted by the central bank was notably less vigorous than it had been in previous years.",
      "All 22 banks tested this year would have remained solvent and above the minimum thresholds to continue to operate, the Fed said, despite absorbing roughly $550 billion in theoretical losses. In the Fed's scenario, there would be less of a rise in unemployment, less of a severe economic contraction, less of a drop in commercial real estate prices, less of a drop in housing prices, among other metrics compared to what they tested in 2024.",
      "All of these less harmful, but simulated, drops mean there would be less damage to these banks' balance sheets and less risk of these banks of potentially failing. Since the banks passed the 2024 tests, it was expected that the banks would pass the 2025 tests.",
      "\u201cLarge banks remain well capitalized and resilient to a range of severe outcomes,\u201d said Michelle Bowman, the bank's vice chair for supervision, in a statement. An appointee of President Trump, Bowman became the Fed's vice chair of supervision earlier this month.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why the Fed chose to go with a less vigorous test this year. In a statement, the bank said previous tests had shown \u201cunintended volatility\u201d in the results and it plans to seek public and industry comment to adjust stress tests in future years. The Fed also chose to not test the banks as heavily on their exposure to private equity assets, arguing that private equity assets are typically held for the long term and are not typically sold at times of distress.",
      "The Fed also didn\u2019t test for any bank exposure to private credit, a $2 trillion asset class that even Fed researchers themselves have observed to be growing alarmingly quickly. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston recently pointed out that private credit could be a systemic risk to the financial system under a severe adverse scenario, which is exactly what the stress tests are supposed to test for.",
      "There was no wording or phrasing in the Fed's press release, reports or methodology about testing or measuring private credit or private debt in this year's test.",
      "The Fed's \u201cstress tests\u201d were created after the 2008 financial crisis as a way to gauge whether the nation's \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks could withstand another financial crisis like the once that happened nearly 20 years ago. The tests are effectively an academic exercise, where the Fed simulates a scenario in the global economy and measures what that scenario would do to bank balance sheets.",
      "The 22 banks that are tested are the biggest names in the business, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and have wide-ranging businesses that touch every part of the U.S. and global economy.",
      "Under this year's hypothetical scenario, a major global recession would have caused a 30% decline in commercial real estate prices and a 33% decline in housing prices. The unemployment rate would rise to 10% and stock prices would fall 50%. In 2024, the hypothetical scenario was a 40% decline in commercial real estate prices, a 55% decline in stock prices and a 36% decline in housing prices.",
      "With their passing grades, the major banks will be allowed to issue dividends to shareholders and buy back shares of stock to return proceeds to investors. Those dividend plans will be announced next week.",

      "Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker said Thursday it will also remove synthetic dyes from foods sold to K-12 schools by the 2026-2027 school year.",
      "Smucker said the majority of its products \u2013 including its Uncrustables sandwiches \u2013 are already free of synthetic dyes. But some products still have them, including sugar-free jams and ice cream toppings.",
      "Smucker said some products from Hostess, which it acquired in 2023, also contain artificial colors. Twinkies are made with Red 40 and Yellow 5, for example, while Snoballs snack cakes are made with Red 40 Lake, a dye combined with aluminum to keep it from dissolving in water.",
      "Smucker joins a growing number of big food companies that have announced plans to eliminate artificial dyes. Earlier this week, Nestle and Conagra Brands \u2014 the parent company of Duncan Hines \u2014 both said they would phase out synthetic dyes. Kraft Heinz and General Mills made similar pledges last week.",
      "The federal government has stepped up its scrutiny of artificial colors in recent months. In January, days before President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",

      "A California judge has ruled the state's bare-bones home insurance program's handling of smoke damage claims is unlawful, a decision that could have wide-ranging implications as insurers increasingly deal with the aftermath of wildfires.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don\u2019t torch the property. The decision Tuesday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stuart M. Rice is a victory for homeowners in a state where the risk of catastrophic wildfires has intensified alongside a brewing home insurance crisis.",
      "The specific case involved Jay Aliff, who sued in 2021 over the insurance payout for his house near Lake Tahoe, which was damaged in the November 2020 Mountain View fire. His lawsuit challenged the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or the FAIR Plan, the state\u2019s high-risk insurance pool or the last-resort option for those dropped by private insurance companies.",
      "With high premiums and basic coverage, the FAIR Plan was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders could find a more permanent option. Today, it has become the default option for many, with the number of residential policies reaching 550,000 in March, more than double from 2020, state data shows.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven\u2019t standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "The FAIR Plan has been scrutinized for years over allegations of summarily denying smoke damage claims unless there\u2019s proof of permanent physical change, even though the California Department of Insurance has long determined that that threshold is illegal.",
      "Aliff's lawsuit claims that FAIR Plan at the time offered a fraction of the money he expected to cover the costs to remediate the damages, citing a partial denial letter that said the fire debris could be cleaned up \u2013- and therefore didn\u2019t qualify for coverage as a \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to the home.",
      "\u201cThe things that burn are terrifying like lead, cyanide. It\u2019s not possible to get that out with Swiffer,\u201d said Aliff\u2019s attorney, Dylan Schaffer, referring to the brand of disposable mops.",
      "Schaffer, who is also the attorney in a number of other lawsuits against the FAIR Plan related to the smoke damage issue, said the new court ruling was a game-changer in California insurance law at a time when thousands of homeowners in the recent Palisades and Eaton wildfires are still fighting for coverage.",
      "\u201cIt is the most important decision in California insurance law in decades,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cIt draws a line in the sand as it relates to where carriers can start carving out their liability and avoiding liability.\u201d",
      "The ruling said the way the FAIR Plan limits smoke damage coverage to its definition of \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d was a violation of the law, stating that \u201cthis language limits coverage reasonably expected by an insured in a manner which is not conspicuous, plain and clear.\u201d",
      "The judge also said it was unlawful that the FAIR Plan required smoke damage to be \u201cvisible to the unaided human eye\u201d or capable of being \u201cdetected by the unaided human nose of an average person\u201d rather than \"the subjective senses of (the insured) or by laboratory testing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing unable to resort to their own senses or laboratory tests, it is entirely unclear how an insured could determine whether a particular loss is covered or not,\u201d the court decision noted.",

      "Republican efforts to loosen regulations on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns have been dealt a big setback",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican efforts to loosen regulations on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns have been dealt a big setback with the Senate parliamentarian advising that the proposal would need to clear a 60-vote threshold if included in their big tax and immigration bill.",
      "Gun rights groups had been lobbying aggressively for the measure, which would essentially treat silencers and the short-barreled firearms like long guns. Gun-control groups celebrated the parliamentarian's ruling, saying the items have been regulated for nearly 100 years for good reason \u2014 they are a threat to first responders and communities.",
      "The House version of the GOP's bill removed silencers \u2014 called \u201csuppressors\u201d by the gun industry \u2014 from a 1930s law that regulates firearms considered the most dangerous, and in the process, would have eliminated a $200 tax. The Senate kept the provision on silencers in its version of the bill and expanded upon it, adding short-barreled, or sawed-off, rifles and shotguns.",
      "Under the National Firearms Act, potential buyers of the regulated weapons must also undergo a finger-print based background check. There is no deadline for such checks. The process is arguably more thorough than the name-based background check completed for other firearms purchases.",
      "Lawmakers said the silencers provision was deemed by the Senate parliamentarian to be in violation of the \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d which stipulates that the budget changes sought in the legislation cannot be \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the policy changes. The special rules are designed to deter provisions unrelated to spending or taxes from being included in the bill.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Republicans will jump at any opportunity to please the gun lobby by rolling back gun safety measures, but that kind of policy does not belong in a reconciliation bill,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.",
      "Gun rights groups complained about the $200 tax and how the background check process often takes weeks and even months for silencers and short-barreled weapons.",
      "Larry Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who supports the legislation, said before the ruling that the proposed changes were aimed at helping target shooters and hunters protect their hearing. He argued that the use of silencers in violent crimes is rare. \u201cAll it\u2019s ever intended to do is to reduce the report of the firearm to hearing safe levels,\u201d Keane said.",
      "John Commerford, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, disagreed with the parliamentarian's ruling, noting that she was originally appointed by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, we remain committed to working with our allies on Capitol Hill to end the unjust tax burden on these constitutionally-protected arms,\u201d Commerford said.",
      "Groups opposed to the measure included Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization co-founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords who was grievously wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in her district.",
      "Emma Brown, the group's executive director said \u201cremoving safeguards on gun silencers would have made it easier for violent criminals to escape, putting both law enforcement and civilians at greater risk.\u201d",
      "\"What\u2019s more, removing safeguards on short barreled firearms would have only enabled more criminals to access these easily concealable weapons, which can be easily brought into large crowds,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The gun language had broad support among Republicans and has received little attention as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., work to settle differences within the party on cuts to Medicaid and energy tax credits, among other issues.",
      "It is just one of hundreds of policy and spending items that were included to entice members to vote for the legislation and will have broad implications in the years to come.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A key inflation gauge moved higher in May in the latest sign that prices remain stubbornly elevated while Americans cut back on their spending.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, an increase from 2.5% the previous month. Both figures are modestly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.",
      "At the same time, Americans cut back on spending for the first time since January, as overall spending fell 0.1%.",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Donald Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffsare still having only a modest effect on prices. The costs of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares, and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month\u2019s 0.1%.",
      "The weakness in spending in part likely reflects reduced purchases of cars and other manufactured goods after Americans stepped up their spending on those items this spring to get ahead of tariffs.",

      "The head of the panel, Christiane Sch\u00f6nefeld, said it faced \u201ca particular challenge this year in view of the stagnating economy and the uncertain forecasts.\u201d She said it conducted \u201cvery difficult talks, which were complicated further by the expectations expressed in public.\u201d",
      "Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy, has had a national minimum wage since 2015. It was introduced at the insistence of the center-left Social Democrats, who were then \u2014 as they are now now \u2014 the junior partners in a conservative-led government.",
      "It started off at 8.50 euros per hour, but the independent commission reviews its level regularly. There has been one political intervention, however: under then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, the government in 2022 ordered an increase to 12 euros an hour, fulfilling a campaign pledge by Scholz.",
      "In their campaign for this year's election, the Social Democrats called for an increase to 15 euros. New Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative bloc strongly opposed another government-ordered raise.",
      "Labor Minister B\u00e4rbel Bas, a leading Social Democrat, said she would implement the commission's proposal. She said she \u201ccan live well with it.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course we wanted more for people in this country,\u201d she told reporters. But she praised the panel for reaching consensus on an increase, \u201cbecause it looked for a long time as though we wouldn't get an agreement at all, and then of course we would have had to talk in the coalition about how to deal with this.\u201d",

      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",
      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Trump could impose tariffs on them.",
      "In China, factory profits sank more than 9% from a year earlier in May, with automakers suffering a large share of that drop. They fell more than 1% year-on-year in January-May.",
      "Trump and other U.S. officials have indicated they expect to reach trade deals with many other countries, including India.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level since early May, an encouraging trend for prospective homebuyers at a time when the U.S. housing market remains largely held back by elevated borrowing costs and rising prices.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.77% from 6.81% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.86%.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hundreds of millions of \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 loans will soon affect credit scores for millions of Americans who use the loans to buy clothing, furniture, concert tickets, and takeout.",
      "Scoring company FICO said Monday that it is rolling out a new model that factors the short-term loans into their consumer scores. A majority of lenders use FICO scores to determine a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness. Previously, the loans had been excluded, though Buy Now, Pay Later company Affirm began voluntarily reporting pay-in-four loans to Experian, a separate credit bureau, in April.",
      "The new FICO scores will be available beginning in the fall, as an option for lenders to increase visibility into consumers' repayment behavior, the company said. Still, not all Buy Now, Pay Later companies share their data with the credit bureaus, and not all lenders will opt in to using the new models, so widespread adoption could take time, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Typically, when using Buy Now, Pay Later loans, consumers pay for a given purchase in four installments over six weeks, in a model more similar to layaway than to a traditional credit card. The loans are marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or only a soft credit check.",
      "The main three credit reporting bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, haven't yet incorporated a standard way of including these new financial products in their reports, since they don't adhere to existing models of lending and repayment. FICO, the score of the Fair Isaac Corporation, uses data from the bureaus to calculate its own credit score, and is independently choosing to pilot a new score that takes the loans into account.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as safer alternatives to credit cards, while consumer advocates warn about \u201cloan stacking,\u201d in which consumers take on many loans at once across several companies. So far, there's been little visibility into this practice in the industry, and the opacity has led to warnings of \u201cphantom debt\" that could mask the health of the consumer.",
      "In a statement, FICO said that their new credit score model is accounting for the growing significance of the loans in the U.S. credit ecosystem.",
      "\u201cBuy Now, Pay Later loans are playing an increasingly important role in consumers\u2019 financial lives,\u201d said Julie May, vice president and general manager of business-to-business scores at FICO. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling lenders to more accurately evaluate credit readiness, especially for consumers whose first credit experience is through BNPL products.\"",
      "FICO said the new model will responsibly expand access to credit. Many users of BNPL loans are younger consumers and consumers who may not have good or lengthy credit histories. In a joint study with Affirm, FICO trained its new scores on a sample of more than 500,000 BNPL borrowers and found that consumers with five or more loans typically saw their scores increase or remain stable under the new model.",
      "For consumers who pay back their BNPL loans in a timely way, the new credit scoring model could help them improve their credit scores, increasing access to mortgages, car loans, and apartment rentals. Currently, the loans don't typically contribute directly to improved scores, though missed payments can hurt or ding a score.",
      "Since March, credit scores have declined steeply for millions, as student loan payments resume and many student borrowers find themselves unable to make regular payments on their federal student loans.",
      "Nadine Chabrier, senior policy and litigation counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said her main concern is that the integration of the loans into a score could have unexpected negative effects on people who are already credit-restrained.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of information out there about how integrating BNPL into credit scoring will work out,\u201d Chabrier said. \u201cFICO simulated the effect on credit scoring through a study. They saw that some users\u2019 scores increased. But if you factor in something that, last week, didn\u2019t affect your credit, and this week, it does, without having very much information about the modeling, it's a little hard to tell what the consequences will be.\u201d",
      "Chabrier cited research that\u2019s shown that many BNPL users have revolving credit card balances, lower credit scores, delinquencies, and existing debt. Women of color are also more likely to use the loans, she said.",
      "\u201cThis is a credit vulnerable community,\u201d said Chabrier.",
      "Rust, of the Consumer Federation of America, said he doesn't expect this to be a game-changer for consumers who already have a credit profile.",
      "\u201cAre we at a point where using BNPL loans will dramatically alter your credit profile? Probably not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it's important that people have reasonable expectations.\u201d",
      "Rust said the average BNPL loan is for $135, and that repaying such small loans, even consistently, might not result in changes to a credit score that would significantly move the needle.",
      "\u201cIt's not about going from 620 to 624. It's about going from 620 to 780,\u201d he said, referring to the kind of credit score jumps that affect one's credit card offers, interest rates on loans, and the like.",
      "Still, Rust said that increased transparency around the loans could create a more accurate picture of a consumer's debts, which could improve accurate underwriting and keep consumers from over-extending themselves.",
      "\u201cThis addresses the problem of \u2018phantom debt,\u2019 and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it could be something that keeps people from getting too deeply into debt they can\u2019t afford.\u201d",

GE Appliances says nearly all the steel used in its U.S. manufacturing for its appliances comes from American steelmakers.",

In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's sprawling Louisville production complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.

      "The redesigned factory will become its most advanced manufacturing plant for clothes washing production, the company said, featuring the latest in automation, robotics and material-handling technologies including automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots.",
      "The new manufacturing lines will open in 2027, the company said.",
      "Next door at the complex's Building 1, the company produces top load washers and front load dryers.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but lacks overall production capacity to make all of its products at its U.S. plants. So it contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and the investment announced Thursday is another step toward achieving that goal.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill doesn't adhere to procedural rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill does not adhere to the chamber's procedural rules, delivering a crucial blow as Republicans rush to finish the package this week.",
      "Guidance from the parliamentarian is rarely ignored and Republican leaders are now forced to consider difficult options. Republicans were counting on big cuts to Medicaid and other programs to offset trillions of dollars in Trump tax breaks, their top priority. Additionally, the parliamentarian, who is the Senate's chief arbiter of its often complicated rules, advised against various GOP provisions barring certain immigrants from health care programs.",
      "Republicans scrambled Thursday to respond, with some calling for challenging, or ever firing, the nonpartisan parliamentarian, who has been on the job since 2012. GOP leaders dismissed those views and instead worked to revise the various proposals.",
      "\u201cWe have contingency plans,\u201d said Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.",
      "Friday's expected votes appeared to be slipping, but Thune insisted that \u201cwe\u2019re plowing forward.\u201d",
      "But Democrats, who are unified against the package as a tax giveaway for the wealthy at the expense of American safety net programs, said the procedural decisions would devastate the GOP package.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Republican proposals would have meant $250 billion less for the health care program, \u201cmassive Medicaid cuts that hurt kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities and working families.\u201d",
      "The outcome is a setback as Senate Republicans race toward a weekend session to pass the bill and send it back to the House for another vote before Trump\u2019s Fourth of July deadline. Trump hosted House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP lawmakers in the East Room at the White House, joined by truck drivers, firefighters, tipped workers, ranchers and others that the administration says will benefit from the bill.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have grandstanders,\u201d Trump said of the GOP holdouts.",
      "Trump said there are \u201chundreds of things\u201d in the emerging package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered money to carry out his mass deportation plans. \u201cIt's so good.\u201d",
      "At its core, the big bill, which has passed the House and is now being revised in the Senate, includes $3.8 trillion in tax breaks that had been approved during Trump's first term but will expire in December, imposing a tax hike if Congress fails to act. To help offset lost revenues, Republicans are relying on steep cuts to health care and food stamps, and imposing new fees on immigrants.",
      "GOP leaders were already struggling to rally support for Medicaid changes that some senators said went too far and would have left millions without coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said more than 10.9 million more people would not have health care under the House-passed bill; Senate Republicans were proposing deeper cuts.",
      "After the parliamentarian advised against the Medicaid provider tax change, Republicans said they would try to revise the provision to make it acceptable, perhaps by extending the start date of any changes. They are rushing to come up with similar adjustments to other proposals that have run into violations, including one to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.",
      "It's all delaying action on the bill, but Republican leaders have little choice. They are counting on the health care restrictions to save billions of dollars and offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Budget Committee chairman, rejected calls to fire the parliamentarian, and said in a statement he was working with the office to \u201cfind a pathway forward.\u201d",
      "States impose the so-called provider tax on hospitals and other entities as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics say the system is a type of \u201claundering,\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the tax, while the Senate would cut the tax that some states are allowed to impose.",
      "Several GOP senators have opposed cutting the Medicaid provider tax, saying it would hurt rural hospitals that depend on the money. Hospital organizations have warned that it could lead to hospital closures.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., among those fighting the change, said he had spoken to Trump late Wednesday and the president told him to revert to the earlier proposal from the House.",
      "\u201cI think it just confirms that we weren\u2019t ready for a vote yet,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who also had raised concerns about the provider tax cuts.",
      "More than 80 million people in the United States use the Medicaid program, alongside the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Republicans want to scale Medicaid back to what they say is its original mission, providing care mainly to women and children, rather than a much larger group of people.",
      "To help defray lost revenues to the hospitals, one plan Republicans had been considering would have created a rural hospital fund with $15 billion as backup. Some GOP senators said that was too much; others, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, wanted at least $100 billion.",
      "The parliamentarian has worked around the clock to assess the legislation and ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. It essentially bars policy matters in budget reconciliation bills.",
      "If leaders moved ahead without altering the provisions, the measures could be challenged, requiring a 60-vote threshold to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate divided 53-47 and with Democrats unified against Trump's bill.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty frustrating,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who wants even steeper reductions.",
      "Overnight Wednesday the parliamentarian advised against GOP student loan repayment plans, and Thursday the parliamentarian cited those that would have blocked access to Medicaid and other health care programs from immigrants who are not citizens. Earlier, plans to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were also found to violate the rules.",
      "But Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said there's no desire to challenge the parliamentarian's advice. \u201cIt's the institutional integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I'm convinced 100% she's wrong.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republicans lost another potential revenue source Thursday after agreeing to a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to remove the so-called revenge tax provision, section 899, that would have allowed the government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners and investors from certain countries. Bessent said he has reached a separate agreement with such countries.",

      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit planet-warming carbon dioxide are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.",
      "The process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.",
      "But it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.",
      "Here's a closer look:",
      "Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.",
      "Industries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped \u2014 usually through a pipeline \u2014 to a location where it\u2019s injected deep underground for long-term storage.",
      "Carbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.",
      "Lauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp., which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.",
      "The carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves \u2014 meaning it's not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60% of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.",
      "Some companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90% or more, \u201cin practice, that has never happened,\u201d said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project\u2019s Oil & Gas Watch.",
      "That's because it's difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it's emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Environmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.",
      "Carbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it's less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.",
      "A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that\u2019s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.",
      "About 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.",
      "It's an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission\u2019s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.",
      "The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world's largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil\u2019s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.",
      "Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a substitution for renewables ... it\u2019s just a complementary technology,\u201d Nepal said. \u201cIt\u2019s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.\u201d",
      "Experts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won't be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.",
      "They remain in the Senate Finance Committee's draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.",

      "Jobless claims for the week ended June 21 dropped 10,000 to 236,000, a historically-low level. The four-week average of claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, dipped 750 to 245,000.",
      "Applications for unemployment aid are a proxy for layoffs, and so the decline is evidence that businesses are mostly holding onto their employees. Yet separate data suggests hiring also remains cool, in what economists are referring to as a \u201cno hire, no fire\u201d job market.",
      "The unemployment rate remains low, though there are signs that the economy is slowing. So far this year, employers have added a solid but unspectacular 124,000 jobs a month, down from an average 168,000 last year. Most of the hiring has been concentrated in a few industries, specifically health care, restaurants and hotels, and government. Layoffs have mostly remained low, but hiring has also been weak.",
      "Yet for many job-seekers, the sluggish creation of new jobs has been a challenge. Recent college graduates are facing the toughest job market in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for grads aged 22 to 27 is now higher than the overall jobless rate, and the gap between the two is the widest it has been in more than 30 years.",
      "The difficulty many of the unemployed are having in finding work can be seen in the number of people continuing to claim unemployment aid, which rose 37,000 to 1.97 million for the week ending June 14. That is the most since November 2021.",
      "Separately, the economy shrank 0.5% at an annual rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday, a worse showing than its previous estimate of a 0.2% decline. A flood of imports swamped the economy as companies rushed to bring in foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs took effect.",
      "A category within the GDP data that measures the economy\u2019s underlying strength rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March, down from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

      "Ch\u00e1vez has fought once since 2021 and is best known for failing to maximize the potential in his famous father's genetics. He is still the most credible boxer by far to share the ring with Paul, who is now 5 1/2 years and 13 fights into his lucrative boxing tenure.",
      "Paul has successfully leveraged his Internet ubiquity and his own hard work to become a force in the business of boxing, if not in championship bouts. He has founded a busy promotional company and flirted with mixed martial arts while becoming one of the most important combat sports athletes in the world on his unique career path.",
      "Paul has mostly fought mixed martial artists and fellow online celebrities, and he took his only loss in February 2023 when he stepped in against actual boxer Tommy Fury, whose fame also exceeds his ring skills.",
      "Paul hadn\u2019t fought since last November, when he beat Mike Tyson in a much-hyped bout that couldn\u2019t live up to improbable expectations from fans who didn\u2019t understand the simple realities of Tyson being 58 years old.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez was away from the ring for three years before his return late last year, but Paul's invitation brought him back again \u2014 along with the thousands of fans who eagerly bought tickets in perpetual support of their champion.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez has fallen to innumerable lows during a lengthy boxing career conducted in the shadow of his father, one of the most beloved athletes in Mexican history. The son has failed drug tests, served suspensions and egregiously missed weight while being widely criticized for his intermittent dedication to the sport.",
      "He still rose to its heights, winning the WBC middleweight title in 2011 and defending it three times. Ch\u00e1vez shared the ring with generational greats Canelo \u00c1lvarez and Sergio Martinez, losing to both.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez even lost in 2021 to Anderson Silva, the former UFC champion and rudimentary boxer who lost a one-sided ring decision to Paul one year later.",
      "Paul's career as the world's most popular pugilistic sideshow could change soon: His financial potency makes it almost inevitable that he will be invited to fight under a sanctioning body's aegis, which means he could likely book a bout against an elite boxer whenever he chooses.",
      "On the solid undercard in Anaheim, 43-year-old former UFC star Holly Holm returned from a 12-year absence from the boxing ring to dominate previously unbeaten Yolanda Guadalupe Vega Ochoa.",
      "New Jersey welterweight Julian Rodriguez then earned a thrilling victory in the waning moments of the 10th and final round, staggering Avious Griffin with a sneaky left hand and eventually knocking the previously unbeaten Griffin sideways into the ropes for a stoppage with 5 seconds left.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act.

      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court agreed on Thursday on details of a decision to hold social media companies liable for what their users post, clearing the way for it go into effect within weeks",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court agreed on Thursday on details of a decision to hold social media companies liable for what their users post, clearing the way for it go into effect within weeks.",
      "The 8-3 vote in Brazil's top court orders tech giants like Google, Meta and TikTok to actively monitor content that involves hate speech, racism and incitation to violence and act to remove it.",
      "The case has unsettled the relationship between the South American nation and the U.S. government. Critics have expressed concern that the move could threaten free speech if platforms preemptively remove content that could be problematic.",
      "After Thursday's ruling is published by the court, people will be able to sue social media companies for hosting illegal content if they refuse to remove it after a victim brings it to their attention. The court didn't set out firm rules on what content is illegal, leaving it to be decided on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The ruling strengthens a law that requires companies to remove content only after court orders, which were often ignored.",
      "It\u2019s the product of two cases accepted by the court last year in which social media companies were accused of failed to act against users promoting fraud, child pornography and violence.",
      "A majority of the 11 justices voted to approve the change two weeks ago, but it took until today to reach consensus on how to implement it.",
      "The justices also agreed that social media companies will not be liable if they can show they took steps to remove illegal content in a timely fashion.",
      "Google said in a statement that is analyzing the court's decision.",
      "\u201cWe remain open for dialogue,\u201d the company said.",
      "Brazil's top court came to the decision after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned of possible visa restrictions against foreign officials involved in censoring American citizens.",
      "Thursday's ruling brings Brazil\u2019s approach to big tech closer to the European Union\u2019s approach, which has sought to rein in the power of social media companies and other digital platforms.",

      "LONDON -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the country is pulling its support from the vaccines alliance Gavi, saying the organization has \u201cignored the science\u201d and \u201clost the public trust.\u201d",
      "A video of Kennedy's speech was shown to participants at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, where the vaccines group was hoping to raise at least $9 billion for the next five years.",
      "Gavi is a public-private partnership including WHO, UNICEF, the Gates Foundation and the World Bank. It has paid for more than 1 billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. The United States has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",
      "Kennedy called on Gavi \u201cto re-earn the public trust and to justify the $8 billion America has provided in funding since 2001,\u201d saying officials must \u201cconsider the best science available, even when that science contradicts established paradigms.\u201d Kennedy said until that happens, the U.S. won\u2019t contribute further to Gavi.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, said he and President Trump were concerned about how Gavi and the World Health Organization partnered together during the COVID-19 pandemic to work with social media companies \u201cto silence dissenting views, to stifle free speech and legitimate questions\u201d during a time when many people had questions about vaccine safety.",
      "Kennedy said Gavi continues to make \u201cquestionable recommendations,\u201d like advising pregnant women to get immunized against COVID-19 and funding the roll-out of a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in poorer countries.",
      "WHO and other health authorities have recommended pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19, saying they are at higher risk of severe disease.",
      "Kennedy said he has seen research that concluded that young girls vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis were more likely to die from all other causes than children who weren\u2019t immunized.",
      "Some observational studies have shown that vaccinated girls do have a higher death rate compared to unvaccinated children, but there is no evidence the deaths are caused by the vaccine.",
      "Gavi said in a statement Thursday that its \u201cutmost concern is the health and safety of children.\u201d The organization said any decision it makes on vaccines to buy is done in accordance with recommendations issued by WHO's expert vaccine group.",
      "\u201cThis ensures Gavi investments are grounded in the best available science and public health priorities,\u201d it said. Gavi said scientists had reviewed all available data, including any studies that raised concerns, and that the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine has \u201cplayed a key role in helping halve childhood mortality.\u201d",
      "The British government said Wednesday it would give 1.25 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) between 2026 and 2030 to Gavi. It said the money would help Gavi protect up to 500 million children in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries from diseases including meningitis, cholera and measles.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran will \u201ccertainly\u201d hurt Russia long-term, Albright said.",
      "Moscow, he said, is \u201cnot going to be able to get as much assistance from Iran as it has been.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "This story has been corrected to show only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target in November 2024, not November 2022.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "Associated Press journalists Lydia Doye in London, Volodymyr Yurchuk and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.",

      "Hackers backing Iran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers backing Tehran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 but so far have not caused widespread disruptions to critical infrastructure or the economy.",
      "But that could change if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses or if independent hacking groups supporting Iran make good on promises to wage their own digital conflict against the U.S., analysts and cyber experts say.",
      "The U.S. strikes could even prompt Iran, Russia, China and North Korea to double down on investments in cyberwarfare, according to Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor.",
      "Bellini noted that hacking operations are much cheaper than bullets, planes or nuclear arms \u2014 what defense analysts call kinetic warfare. America may be militarily dominant, he said, but its reliance on digital technology poses a vulnerability.",
      "\u201cWe just showed the world: You don\u2019t want to mess with us kinetically,\u201d said Bellini, CEO of Bellini Capital. \u201cBut we are wide open digitally. We are like Swiss cheese.\"",
      "Two pro-Palestinian hacking groups claimed they targeted more than a dozen aviation firms, banks and oil companies following the U.S. strikes over the weekend.",
      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",
      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Calls to bolster America's digital defense come as the Trump administration has moved to slash some cybersecurity programs as part of its effort to shrink the size of government.",
      "CISA has placed staffers who worked on election security on leave and cut millions of dollars in funding for cybersecurity programs for local and state elections.",
      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",
      "There is a new arms race when it comes to cyberwar, Bellini said, and it's a contest America can't afford to lose.",
      "\u201cIt's Wile E. Coyote vs. the Road Runner,\u201d Bellini said. \"It will go back and forth, and it will never end.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- It is often said music is the universal language of humanity. Now a 12-year-old Houston boy is putting that to the test among an unlikely audience \u2014 man's best friend.",
      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "In a test case for the artificial intelligence industry, a federal judge has ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books.",
      "But the company is still on the hook and must now go to trial over how it acquired those books by downloading them from online \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated copies.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "But while dismissing a key claim made by the group of authors who sued the company for copyright infringement last year, Alsup also said Anthropic must still go to trial in December over its alleged theft of their works.",
      "\u201cAnthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "A trio of writers \u2014 Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 alleged in their lawsuit last summer that Anthropic's practices amounted to \u201clarge-scale theft,\" and that the San Francisco-based company \u201cseeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\u201d",
      "Books are known to be important sources of the data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build large language models. In the race to outdo each other in developing the most advanced AI chatbots, a number of tech companies have turned to online repositories of stolen books that they can get for free.",
      "Documents disclosed in San Francisco's federal court showed Anthropic employees' internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. But that didn't undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",
      "\u201cThat Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "The ruling could set a precedent for similar lawsuits that have piled up against Anthropic competitor OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, as well as against Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Anthropic \u2014 founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021 \u2014 has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way.",
      "But the lawsuit filed last year alleged that Anthropic\u2019s actions \u201chave made a mockery of its lofty goals\u201d by building its AI product on pirated writings.",
      "Anthropic said Tuesday it was pleased that the judge recognized that AI training was transformative and consistent with \u201ccopyright\u2019s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.\u201d Its statement didn't address the piracy claims.",
      "The authors' attorneys declined comment.",

      "The U.K.\u2019s antitrust watchdog says Google could be forced to let British users choose whether to use rival search services, as it proposes using new digital regulations to boost competition",
      "LONDON -- Google could be forced to let British users choose whether to use rival search services, the country's antitrust watchdog said Tuesday as it proposed using new digital regulations to boost competition.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said its \u201cpriority measures\u201d include requiring Google to present users with \u201cchoice screens\u201d when they use key products like the Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.",
      "The choice screens would let users \u201ceasily select and switch between search services,\" which could potentially include AI assistants, it said.",
      "The watchdog is seeking to give Google a \u201c strategic market status \u201d label under the new U.K. digital rules. That would give it the power to use \u201ctargeted measures\u201d to impose changes to \u201cspecific aspects\u201d of its search operations in the U.K.",
      "The CMA's move \u201ccould have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK,\u201d Google said.",
      "Oliver Bethell, Google\u2019s senior director of competition, noted in a prepared statement that CMA reiterated that \u2018strategic market status\u2019 doesn't imply that anti-competitive behavior has taken place, \"yet this announcement presents clear challenges to critical areas of our business in the U.K.,\u201d",
      "The watchdog has until Oct. 13 to decide on whether to give Google the label.",
      "It has drawn up three other initial priority measures that it would carry out if it goes ahead.",
      "Google would have to make its search results ranking and presentation fair and non-discriminatory, and give businesses an effective way to complain if they've been treated unfairly.",
      "Publishers should be given choice and transparency about how their content collected by Google is used for AI services, such as AI-generated overviews that have been appearing at the top of search results.",
      "The CMA also wants to ensure people can easily transfer their data, such as their Google search history, to other businesses, which the CMA said could foster innovative new products and services.",

      "Waymo\u2019s robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service that began earlier this year in Austin",
      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

      "A Japanese company says a laser navigating tool doomed its lunar lander, causing it to crash into the moon",
      "A laser navigating tool doomed a Japanese company's lunar lander earlier this month, causing it to crash into the moon.",
      "Officials for ispace announced the news from Tokyo on Tuesday. The crash landing was the second for ispace in two years.",
      "This time, the company\u2019s lander named Resilience was aiming for the moon\u2019s far north in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold. NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed pictures of the crash site last week where Resilience and its mini rover ended up as wreckage.",
      "Company officials blamed the accident on the lander's laser range finder, saying it was slow to kick in and properly measure the spacecraft's distance to the lunar surface. Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada stressed that his company \u201chas not stepped down in the face of setbacks\" and is looking to regain customers' trust. Outside experts will join the accident review, and ispace will collaborate more closely with the Japanese Space Agency on technical matters.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re firmly taking the next step toward our future missions,\u201d he said in Japanese.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

      "Three Iranians were executed for alleged spying, Iran's judiciary said.",
      "Three Iranian men were executed this week on alleged charges of collaborating with Israel, according to the Islamic Republic judiciary, bringing the total number of people put to death on similar charges during the 12-day war between Tehran and Tel Aviv to six.",
      "The hangings were part of the \"season of traitor-killing,\" according to Iran's ISNA News Agency, as Iranian authorities pushed the executions through less than 48 hours after the ceasefire between Iran and Israel was announced on Monday.",
      "Iran's judiciary said the men were convicted of espionage on behalf of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. However, human rights activists claim the men were Kurdish day-laborers with no access to classified information and were denied fair trials.",
      "\"This is a very corrupt regime, and there is no due process in Iran,\" Azadeh Pourzand, a Middle East and human rights expert and a senior fellow and head of the State-Society Relations Unit at the think tank Centre for Middle East and Global Order, told ABC News.",
      "The crackdown follows a war with Israel that Iranian authorities say left at least 627 people dead and 4,870 injured, along with major infrastructure damage across the country.",
      "Iran's current regime, however, is still maintaining power while many analysts had speculated the possibility of a regime change in the aftermath of the destruction of military infrastructure and the killing of many high ranking military commanders, along with ambiguities about the Iranian supreme leader's health and whereabouts.",
      "Given the country's track record in similar situations over nearly half a century of rule, many human rights activists and Iranians inside the country view this \"defeated and wounded\" phase as, potentially, the regime's most dangerous, especially in terms of repression.",
      "Several Iranians who have been against the war told ABC News that they are concerned about the regime taking its revenge on people.",
      "\"I cried once when the war started, and again when the ceasefire was announced,\" a 37-year-old woman from Rasht, who declined to be named out of fear of safety concerns, told ABC News. \"We fear the Islamic Republic just as much as we fear Israel.\"",
      "Over the course of the 12-day conflict, Iranian intelligence and security forces said they arrested more than 700 people accused of having ties to Israel, according to state affiliate PressTV earlier this week.",
      "Sharing deep concerns about the safety of the human rights activists, journalists and women, Pourzand said the regime has already \"accelerated its execution machine.\"",
      "Israeli officials have not commented on those arrested for alleged ties to Israel but Mossad Chief David Barnea said this week the Israeli intelligence agency would continue to keep a \"close eye\" on Iran.",
      "\"We will continue to keep a close eye on all the projects in Iran that we know very well. We will be there(in Iran), as we have been there until now,\" Barnea said.",
      "Additionally, on June 25, Iran's judiciary announced changes to what it called the \"Espionage Law for Dealing with Citizens,\" with the Intelligence Ministry announcing the formation of a new special committee tasked with monitoring citizens' online activities -- a campaign state media has labeled an \"intelligence jihad,\" highlighting it as part of a broader \"national defense\" effort.",
      "\"There are security forces out patrolling the streets in full force. We hardly dare go out,\" Samira, a 23-year-old student activist in Tehran, told ABC News. \"It's an extremely terrifying time. I think we're about to enter a phase of further paralysis and suffocation.\"",
      "Pourzand -- the human rights advocate -- described the post-war atmosphere as a \"systematic and rigid form of repression,\" warning that the new surveillance measures will further tighten control over public dissent and personal freedoms.",
      "\"This is collective punishment against ordinary people \u2026 in order to make a point and instill fear domestically, and to make points internationally,\" she said.",
      "For critics, the Islamic Republic's response follows a well-worn pattern.",
      "\"This regime has mastered how to own the narrative over the past 47 years,\" Pourzand said. \"They use all sorts of tools -- misinformation, disinformation.\"",
      "The conflict has stirred mixed emotions among Iranians, many of whom are still grappling with the trauma of the state's crackdown that followed the 2022 nationwide \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" protests that were ignited after the tragic death of Mahsa Jina Amini in police custody.",
      "The crackdown left hundreds killed, thousands imprisoned and several executed. The uprising followed years of repression and economic hardship made worse by U.S.-led sanctions on top of widespread regime corruption that has only deepened the public's frustration and despair.",
      "Some Iranians initially viewed Israel's early rhetoric about \"freeing Iranians\" from dictatorship with hope.",
      "\"The Islamic Republic is a totalitarian regime \u2026 which has brought decades of destruction, insecurity, and regional instability,\" Parham, 36, told ABC News. \"Supporting the Iranian people in their quest for freedom is not only a moral imperative but also a pathway toward peace, prosperity, and stability in the region.\"",
      "However, not everyone shares the same sentiment.",
      "\"It'd be foolish to believe Israel's objective was ever to free us from this regime,\" Samira said. \"They made it clear their only goal was the destruction of Iran's nuclear capabilities.\"",
      "On Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first public appearance since the start of the war, emerging from weeks of absence to deliver a taped televised address to the nation.",
      "\"This is one of the greatest divine blessings,\" Khamenei said, referring to Iran's armed forces penetrating multiple layers of Israeli defense systems during the recent conflict. \"It shows the Zionist regime that any aggression against the Islamic Republic will come at a cost -- a heavy cost -- and thankfully, that's exactly what happened.\"",
      "However, some now fear that Khamenei's \"heavy cost\" will ultimately fall on Iranian citizens, as the world's attention shifts elsewhere, leaving them at the mercy of a regime determined to prove it remains in control.",
      "\"What's already started is quite horrific,\" Pourzand said. \"Unfortunately, I think what's coming will be even worse.\"",

      "Mamdani upset former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday with a campaign that zeroed in on affordability: He pledged to raise taxes to He pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations, help fund city-owned grocery stores, eliminate bus fares and expand public housing initiatives.",

That's so bad for New York, but the rest of the country is revolting against it.\u201d",

      "\"Listen, the progressive left will not stop. They will not stop trying to lead us down a path to socialism, and therefore we can never stop \u2026 Look what happened in New York. They nominated a mayoral candidate who would make Bernie Sanders blush,\" Youngkin said.",

It's a big deal. I mean, whether the Democrats would want it or not if he won the primary, he's helping to define that party.\"",

      "Just hours after Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York's mayoral primary on Wednesday, a small group of business leaders convened with Mayor Eric Adams, who bypassed the Democratic primary and is instead running in the general election as an independent.",

      "Tilson told ABC News when it became clear the race was between two people, he had hoped former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo would win. He said he would \"...continue for the next 130 days what I began in earnest 45 days ago -- to make sure Zohran Mamdani, an unqualified radical socialist, does not become mayor of our city.\"",
      "Several other vexed moderate-minded Democrats, beyond the handful in the meeting with Adams, are making similar schemes, a Democratic source with knowledge of the conversations confirmed to ABC.",
      "That source suggested that some are mulling over boosting centrist lawyer Jim Walden, who is running as an independent, as a potential spoiler. And billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman (who supported Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election) pledged to bankroll whichever viable challenger vows to take on Mamdani in November.",
      "Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, wrote that Mamdani's win was \"disastrous\" and that she, Ackman, and others must \"figure out a way to save New York\" in response to his promise.",
      "However, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he's not aware of any progressives who are \"quaking in their boots about a particular scenario\" and that serious Mamdani supporters' worries come not from threats, but \"because we should be worried of the unknown, and no one should take this general election lightly.\"",
      "\"It's more than ironic that Ackman thinks he has anything left to say to anybody in the Democratic Party after his activities last few months,\" de Blasio told ABC News. \"As some of these people are flailing about, they are only reminding people that Zohran's positions are going to be the majority positions in this town.\"",
      "The former mayor, whom Mamdani said was the best in his lifetime, said he doesn't believe the accusations of radicalism or extremism will stick, pointing to Mamdani's strong margins from Tuesday night.",
      "\"I think the magnitude of the victory has woken up a lot of people who were buying into stereotypes -- unfair stereotypes -- of Zohran,\" de Blasio said. \"You can't be extreme if such a clear majority want you. To use a New York City phrase: he's instantly been koshered.\"",
      "Mamdani isn't shielding himself from the incoming, either.",
      "Longtime New York powerbroker Kathryn Wylde told ABC News Mamdani called her Thursday evening, and expressed interest in meeting with the CEOs whom Wylde said were \"extremely concerned\" with his economic and fiscal policies.",
      "Wylde agreed -- and plans to host a meeting between Mamdani and any of the interested 300 plus executives who are members of Partnership for the City, where she serves as CEO, during the third week in July.",
      "\"The business community will not determine who is mayor. But we want whomever is mayor to have relationships and understand the issues that will keep our city strong,\" Wylde said.",
      "His campaign told ABC News he's committed to meeting \"with anyone and everyone.\"",
      "\"As Zohran has said throughout this campaign, he'll meet with anyone and everyone to move our city forward. Zohran's committed to delivering an administration of excellence that delivers an affordable and safe city for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\" Mamdani campaign spokesperson Lekha Sunder said in a statement.",
      "Mark Gorton, founder of LimeWire and chairman of Tower Research Capital hedge fund, said he donated $250,000 to Cuomo's super PAC, Fix the City, after it became clear that his preferred candidate, Brad Lander, would not win the primary. However, Gorton acknowledged to ABC News he did so reluctantly.",
      "\"I was like, 'I'm tired of being on the outside -- I want to be on the inside,\" he said.",
      "Still, he knew his top concerns -- support for cyclists, reducing car traffic and expanding bus service -- were not priorities for Cuomo.",
      "\"Cuomo was a disaster,\" the activist, who started a non-profit focused on New York's streets nearly three decades ago, said. \"He didn't even show up at the candidate forum and drives around in a Dodge Charger.\"",
      "Gorton said he felt relieved when Cuomo lost, noting that both Mamdani and Lander are strong on the issues he cares about. If November's election were held today, he said, he would vote for Mamdani.",
      "When asked whether he would contribute to Mamdani's campaign, Gorton hesitated.",
      "\"He doesn't need my money. Money doesn't always make a difference,\" he said.",
      "Some Democrats in New York's Congressional delegation are distancing themselves from Mamdani. Speaking on WNYC's \"The Brian Lehrer Show\" on Thursday Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand declined to say who she would endorse. When pressed, she said: \"I vote in Albany,\" and will leave the decision to New York City voters.",
      "Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represents a Long Island swing-district that includes some parts of Queens, posted on X that he continues to have \"serious concerns\" about Mamdani.",
      "Yet some of the highest ranking of the delegation seem open to Mamdani.",
      "Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, praised Mamdani after his apparent primary win. Showing particular support for his campaign's focus on affordability, both vowed to meet with him. Rep. Gregory Meeks, (D-NY), also told ABC News he was looking to speak with the presumptive nominee.",
      "Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the most senior Jewish member of the House of Representatives, went even further. After backing one of Mamdani's challengers during the primary, Nadler has since endorsed Mamdani's general election bid.",
      "And former president Bill Clinton, who backed Cuomo, wrote on X that he is \"wishing [Mamdani] much success in November and beyond as you look to bring New Yorkers together.\"",
      "Veteran Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who once worked for Cuomo and is now a critic, told ABC News centrist Democrats are partially to blame for the former governor's loss and suggested they look in the mirror.",
      "\"It is baffling that they decided to cast their lot with a disgraced former governor who was run out of office and had no new ideas or inspirational message to offer New Yorkers. Spare us the freak out,\" said Smith. \"This just seems like the last gasp of the establishment and the affiliated billionaires trying to stop a grassroots moment that, frankly, they helped fuel.\"",

    "summary": "Effective immediately, the Trump administration can begin planning for how it would implement an end to birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "The administration can start planning how it will end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday handed down a highly-anticipated ruling involving President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship.",
      "But many questions remain about how such an order would be carried out on a practical level.",
      "And while the court's conservative majority limited nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges against the order, the court did not rule on whether the order itself is constitutional.",
      "Still, the decision could lead to a radical reshaping of a legal right to citizenship that's been long guaranteed by the 14th Amendment -- at least in the short term.",
      "Effective immediately, the administration can begin planning for how it would implement an end to birthright citizenship.",
      "Trump's order itself has a 30-day grace period before taking effect, meaning right now there is no change to birthright citizenship and children born everywhere in the country are still U.S. citizens.",
      "Regulations will need to be drafted and specifics of such an order still need to be addressed: for example, will every pregnant woman in America now need to go to the hospital with a passport or birth certificate?",
      "The White House on Friday had no clear answers when pressed for specifics.",
      "Federal district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and New Hampshire will soon have to revisit nationwide injunctions issued there in light of the court's decision and tailor or narrow them to apply only to the plaintiffs who brought these cases.",
      "The plaintiffs were 22 states, immigrant advocacy groups and a number of pregnant noncitizen women.",
      "Challengers to Trump's executive order will continue to litigate the order on the merits. No court has directly considered the constitutionality of the executive order, though three lower courts have said it would appear to plainly violate the 14th Amendment and there are three longstanding Supreme Court precedents unambiguously upholding birthright citizenship.",
      "But for the remaining 28 states that have not sued, Trump's attempts to end birthright citizenship could go into effect in as soon as 30 days.",
      "Challengers can and will also fight broad implementation in other ways as it moves forward.",
      "On Friday, one group filed a class action lawsuit seeking broad protection of all noncitizen pregnant women, even those who are not plaintiffs.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated plaintiffs might also be able to challenge the administration's citizenship regulations, once issued, under the Administrative Procedures Act.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, though, struggled on Friday to address how exactly administration is planning to implement Trump's order.",
      "Asked who would be tasked with vetting citizenship (for example, whether it would be nurses or doctors as babies are being born) Bondi only responded: \"This is all pending litigation.\"",
      "Another reporter asked Bondi, \"If you have an undocumented baby, would that baby then be an enforcement priority?\"",
      "\"The violent criminals in our country are the priority,\" Bondi deflected.",
      "What's next for nationwide injunctions?",
      "More broadly, the administration will likely seek to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking Trump policies in other cases.",
      "Those hearings and decisions will play out in the coming weeks.",
      "\"These injunctions have blocked our policies from tariffs to military readiness to immigration to foreign affairs, fraud, abuse and many other issues,\" Bondi said on Friday. \"The judges have tried to seize the executive branch's power and they cannot do that. No longer.\"",
      "President Trump said similarly as he celebrated the ruling.",
      "\"So, thanks to this decision, we can now promptly filed to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship, ending sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, stopping federal taxpayers from paying for transgender surgeries and numerous other priorities of the American people,\" the president said.",

      "Fox News \"should face consequences\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for $787 million for defamation.",
      "Newsom's allegations stem from Fox News host Jesse Watters' coverage of the battle between the governor and President Donald Trump when the Trump administration sent the California National Guard to Los Angeles earlier this month.",
      "Watters allegedly reported on Fox News that Newsom lied about a phone call with Trump, and the governor claims in his lawsuit that Watters' show misleadingly edited a video of Trump to support the claim.",
      "Trump, asked by a reporter on June 10 when was the last time he had spoken to Newsom, replied, \"A day ago. Called him to tell him, got to do a better job, he's doing a bad job\" -- even though, according to Newsom, the last time they had spoken was three days prior to that, at 1:28 a.m. ET on June 7, and Newsom said they had not discussed the protests in question.",
      "After Newsom asserted on X that the two had not spoken on June 9 as Trump appeared to have said, Watters, according to the lawsuit, accused Newsom of lying and played the video clip of Trump telling the reporter the two had spoken -- but edited out the start of the clip where Trump said \"a day ago.\"",
      "\"If Fox News wants to lie to the American people on Donald Trump's behalf, it should face consequences -- just like it did in the Dominion case,\" Newsom said in a statement Friday, referring to the 2023 settlement Fox reached with Dominion Voting Systems -- also for $787 million -- after the voting machine company accused Fox News of knowingly pushing false conspiracy theories that Dominion rigged the 2020 presidential election in Joe Biden's favor.",
      "\"I believe the American people should be able to trust the information they receive from a major news outlet,\" Newsom said in his statement. \"Until Fox is willing to be truthful, I will keep fighting against their propaganda machine.\"",
      "In a letter sent to Fox, Newsom's attorneys said that unless Fox News issues a retraction and an on-air apology, \"we will proceed with the lawsuit so that a jury can determine Fox News\u2019s culpability and assign a monetary value to its 'blatantly unethical' conduct.\"",
      "Fox News, in a statement, said, \"Gov. Newsom's transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him. We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 16:14:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out of public school instruction that conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs.",
    "story": [
      "The court voted 6-3 in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out of public school instruction that conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs.",
      "The case, brought by a group of Christian, Muslim and Jewish parents from Montgomery County, Maryland, sought a guaranteed exemption from the classroom reading of storybooks with LGBTQ themes, including same-sex marriage and exploration of gender identity.",
      "Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson cast the dissenting votes in the 6-3 decision.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, said in the decision that refusing to allow parents to opt-out their kids from instruction that \"poses a very real threat of undermining their religious beliefs and practices\" violates the First Amendment protections for religious exercise.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education's \"introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks, along with its decision to withhold opt outs, places an unconstitutional burden on the parents' rights to the free exercise of their religion,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The court found that the parents are also likely to succeed in their lawsuit over free-exercise claims, and have shown they are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuit proceeds.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor accused the court of inventing a \"constitutional right to avoid exposure to subtle themes contrary to the religious principles that parents wish to instill in their children.\"",
      "She also reproduced in full one of the books at the heart of the dispute -- \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" an illustrated children's book about a gay couple and their niece -- in the appendix of her dissent. Alito accused the book of advancing a \"specific, if subtle, message\" about marriage -- that two people, regardless of their sex, can get married so long as they love each other -- that is \"contrary to the religious principles that the parents in this case wish to instill in their children.\"",
      "\"The majority's myopic attempt to resolve a major constitutional question through close textual analysis of Uncle Bobby's Wedding also reveals its failure to accept and account for a fundamental truth: LGBTQ people exist. They are part of virtually every community and workplace of any appreciable size,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent while blasting Alito for his interpretation of the book. \"Eliminating books depicting LGBTQ individuals as happily accepted by their families will not eliminate student exposure to that concept. Nor does the Free Exercise Clause require the government to alter its programs to insulate students from that 'message.'\"",
      "In 2022, after introducing several LGBTQ-themed books into its language arts curriculum, the Montgomery County school board allowed parents to opt out if the content was deemed objectionable as a matter of faith. One year later, officials reversed course and said the opt-out program had become unwieldy and ran counter to values of inclusion.",
      "The parents alleged that use of the books in an elementary school curriculum -- without an opportunity to be excused -- amounts to government-led indoctrination regarding sensitive matters of sexuality. The school board insisted the books merely expose kids to diverse viewpoints and ideas.",
      "Pending the completion of the legal challenge, the school board \"should be ordered to notify them in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled during oral arguments in April that it was poised to establish a right of parents to opt out for sensitive subjects, saying it should be common sense.",
      "Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty who argued the case on behalf of the parents seeking the opt-out, called the ruling an \"historic victory for parental rights in Maryland and across America.\"",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents' permission,\" Baxter said in a statement. \"Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents -- not government -- have the final say in how their children are raised.\"",
      "An attorney representing the authors of some of the books involved in the case called the ruling \"a deeply disappointing blow to the right to read under the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"It is a fundamental betrayal of public schools' duty to prepare students to live in a diverse and pluralistic society,\" attorney Elly Brinkley, with U.S. Free Expression Programs, said in a statement. \"By allowing parents to pull their children out of classrooms when they object to particular content, the justices are laying the foundation for a new frontier in the assault on books of all kinds in schools.\"",
      "Brinkley said opt-outs for religious objections \"will chill what is taught in schools and usher in a more narrow orthodoxy as fear of offending any ideology or sensibility takes hold.\"",
      "President Donald Trump called the ruling a \"tremendous victory for parents\" during a White House press briefing Friday.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, during the briefing, thanked the Supreme Court for the decision, saying that restoring parents' rights to decide their child's education \"seems like a basic idea, but it took the Supreme Court to set the record straight.\"",
      "\"Now that ruling allows parents to opt out of dangerous trans ideology and make the decisions for their children that they believe is correct,\" Blanche said.",

      "\"This is a pretty big step back,\" Stuart Milk, Harvey Milk's nephew, told ABC.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday the USNS Harvey Milk is being renamed the USNS Oscar V. Peterson, after he ordered the Navy to strike the name of the pioneering gay rights activist from the ship.",
      "Hegseth made the announcement in a video posted to X.",
      "\"We are taking the politics out of ship naming,\" Hegseth said. \"We're not renaming the ship to anything political. This is not about political activists, unlike the previous administration. Instead, we're renaming the ship after a United States Navy Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, as it should be.\"",
      "Peterson, Hegseth said, was a chief watertender who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism during an attack on the USS Neosho by Japanese bombers during the Battle of Coral Sea in World War II.",
      "According to the Navy, Peterson kept the ship operational and was credited with saving the lives of 123 of his shipmates before succumbing to his injuries.",
      "Milk was also a Navy veteran, serving nearly four years in the service. He was discharged at the rank of a junior lieutenant after being threatened with a court martial because of his sexual orientation.",
      "Milk was one of the first openly gay men elected to public office in the United States after winning a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. He was assassinated a year later.",
      "Hegseth ordered the Navy to rename the ship during Pride Month, which celebrates the LGBTQ community.",
      "Stuart Milk, the nephew of Harvey Milk and the founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, told ABC News that his uncle \"would say this is a call to action\" and that sailors he met on the USNS Harvey Milk were \"very proud to serve\" on the ship.",
      "He called Hegseth's premise for the renaming of the oiler -- that \"people want to be proud of the ship they're sailing in\" -- as \"antithetical to the truth.\"",
      "\"We sometimes go two steps forward and one step back,\" Stuart Milk said. \"This is a pretty big step back.\"",
      "But \"the fact of the matter is my uncle's legacy will live well past the 40 years' life of a military ship, but it's also endured quite a bit,\" he added.",
      "Lindsay Church, the executive director of the advocacy group Minority Veterans of America, told ABC News that Hegseth is \"America's culture warrior, and is bringing that particular lens into leading the Department of Defense, rather than focusing on military readiness and what will actually make Americans safer.\"",
      "\"We put that uniform on, we are Americans. When we take the uniform off and continue to serve our country, we are Americans,\" Church said.",
      "There are currently no plans to rename other ships in this class, according to Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk is part of a fleet of replenishment oilers named after civil rights advocates including Chief Justice Earl Warren and US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.",
      "While Hegseth said he wants to take the politics out of ship naming, the effort is an inherently political endeavor.",
      "Traditionally, the Navy Secretary -- a political appointee confirmed by Congress -- is in charge of naming ships at the direction of the president.",
      "Of the Navy's 15 most recently named aircraft carriers, 10 have been named for past U.S. presidents and two for members of Congress, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "In the past, Hegseth criticized efforts by the Biden administration to change the name of military bases that honored Confederate generals.",
      "In the case of Fort Bragg in North Carolina, which was named more than a century ago after a Confederate general who lost battles in the Civil War, Hegseth argued that \"legacy matters\" and it breaks a \"generational link\" for people who serve there.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said renaming the USNS Harvey Milk is different.",
      "\"In no way is the Fort Bragg renaming comparable to a potential renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk -- which occurred very recently in 2016 under the Obama Administration and was widely viewed as an ideologically-motivated action that countless sailors and veterans found abhorrent,\" Parnell said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "While a partial Trump win on nationwide injunctions, challenges can continue.",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday granted a partial stay of nationwide injunctions issued against President Donald Trump's executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship, handing Trump a win amid his showdown with federal judges who've blocked parts of his second-term agenda.",
      "The 6-3 opinion came from Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The court's three liberal justices dissented.",
      "The court, however, said it was not deciding whether the executive order from Trump was constitutional, rather focusing on whether a single judge has the authority to issue universal injunctions.",
      "\"Government\u2019s applications for partial stays of the preliminary injunctions are granted, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,\" the opinion read.",
      "Trump took a victory lap in a rare appearance in the White House briefing room shortly after the decision came down.",
      "\"Amazing decision, one we're very happy about,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "\"This morning the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch,\" he said.",
      "However, legal challenges will continue to Trump's Day 1 order to deny citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to unlawful immigrants or those on a temporary immigrant status, as the court did not rule on the merits of the cases.",
      "The individual plaintiffs in these cases remain protected under the injunctions issued.",
      "\"Prohibiting enforcement of the Executive Order against the child of an individual pregnant plaintiff will give that plaintiff complete relief: Her child will not be denied citizenship,\" Barrett said. \"Extending the injunction to cover all other similarly situated individuals would not render her relief any more complete.\"",
      "Trump can move forward immediately, though, with developing plans to implement the birthright citizenship order -- which will not take effect for 30 days.",
      "Friday's decision is a boost for Trump in his crusade against nationwide injunctions that have blocked some of the executive actions he's taken so far in his second term.",
      "Supporters of nationwide injunctions say they serve as an essential check to potentially unlawful conduct and prevent widespread harm. Critics say they give too much authority to individual judges and incentivize plaintiffs to try to evade random assignment and file in jurisdictions with judges who may be sympathetic to their point of view.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor read her blistering dissent aloud from the bench, criticizing the court's majority.",
      "\"No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from lawabiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\"",
      "\"The majority holds that, absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief,\" she added. \"That holding renders constitutional guarantees meaningful in name only for any individuals who are not parties to a lawsuit. Because I will not be complicit in so grave an attack on our system of law, I dissent.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the Trump administration of \"gamesmanship\" and said with this ruling the Supreme Court's majority \"plays along.\"",
      "\"Every conceivable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law of the land,\" she wrote in dissent.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately to underscore, in his view, the narrowness of the decision, insisting that class-action claims are still available and that the Supreme Court itself can and likely will review lower courts along the way with respect to scope of relief from an alleged illegal government policy.",
      "Kavanaugh also noted that the Administrative Procedures Act remains an avenue for plaintiffs to bring challenges to presidential policies on a nationwide basis.",
      "Reaction to the ruling was largely split along party lines, with Republicans calling it a win for the administration while Democrats expressed serious concern that Trump's actions could go unchecked.",
      "\"The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to limit courts of their long-held authority to block illegal executive actions is an unprecedented and terrifying step toward authoritarianism, a grave danger to our democracy, and a predictable move from this extremist MAGA court,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X. \"By weakening the power of district courts to check the presidency, the Court is not defending the Constitution -- it\u2019s defacing it.\"",

      "CNN first reported on Thursday night that Cuomo, who conceded to state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor on Tuesday, would not withdraw from the independent ballot line but had not yet decided whether to actively campaign in the coming months.",
      "In a speech to supporters Tuesday night, Cuomo told supporters, \"Tonight was not our night; tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani's night\u2026 He deserved it. He won. We're going to take a look and make some decisions.\"",
      "Candidates have until the end of Friday, June 27 to withdraw from running on an independent ballot line they qualified for, according to the New York State Board of Elections calendar.",
      "A source close to the campaign told ABC News on Thursday that the former governor is looking at all of the data, including that the New York City Board of Elections would only start releasing ranked-choice voting tabulations on July 1.",
      "Cuomo told CBS 2 New York on Wednesday, \"So I have that independent line. I qualified for that. And I'm on that line in November. And we're going to be looking at the numbers that come in from the primary. And then we have to look at the landscape in the general election, which is a totally different landscape.\"",
      "He added later, \"We'll take it one step at a time because we haven't even gotten the [full] numbers yet from the primary election, and we have some time.\"",
      "Cuomo's run for mayor comes four years after he resigned as governor after several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. He has denied the allegations and recently told The New York Times he regrets resigning.",
      "On Thursday, incumbent Democratic Mayor Eric Adams, who's also running as an independent in the general election, officially kicked off his reelection campaign.",
      "Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and independent candidate Jim Walden will also be on the ballot in November.",

      "Greenpeace has joined the smattering of protests in Venice against the upcoming wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez",
      "ROME -- Greenpeace on Monday joined the smattering of protests in Venice against the upcoming wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.",
      "A half-dozen protesters unfurled a giant banner early Monday in St. Mark\u2019s Square reading: \u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\u201d Local police quickly folded it up and took it away.",
      "The demonstration followed other anti-Bezos initiatives last week including a banner draped from the San Giorgio bell tower, one from the lagoon city\u2019s famous Rialto Bridge and posters plastered up around town complaining about the upcoming wedding and the effects of overtourism on Venice.",
      "The \u201cNo Space for Bezos\u201d movement \u2014 a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight \u2014 has united a dozen Venetian organizations including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups.",
      "Activists argue the wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over resident needs.",
      "Greenpeace said it teamed with the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, for Monday\u2019s banner. Greenpeace said it wanted to draw attention to the comparitively low taxes many billionaires pay while allegedly exacerbating the climate crisis with environmentally unsustainable lifestyles.",
      "Italian and Venetian officials have strongly criticized the protests and welcomed the Bezos-Sanchez nuptials, which are scheduled for later this week.",
      "Over the weekend, as the protests continued to make headlines in Italy, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, said Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but noted contacts began in April, well before the protests started.",

    "summary": "Some Iranians are getting arrested by immigration authorities after living decades in the United States",
    "story": [
      "Some Iranians are getting arrested by immigration authorities after living decades in the United States",
      "Mandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian lived in the United States for 47 years, married a U.S. citizen and raised their daughter. She was gardening in the yard of her New Orleans home when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers handcuffed and took her away, her family said.",
      "Kashanian arrived in 1978 on a student visa and applied for asylum, fearing retaliation for her father's support of the U.S.-backed shah. She lost her bid, but she was allowied to remain with her husband and child if she checked in regularly with immigration officials, her husband and daughter said. She complied, once checking in from South Carolina during Hurricane Katrina. She is now being held at an immigration detention center in Basile, Louisiana, while her family tries to get information.",
      "Other Iranians are also getting arrested by immigration authorities after decades in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security won't say how many people they've arrested, but U.S. military strikes on Iran have fueled fears that there is more to come.",
      "\u201cSome level of vigilance, of course, makes sense, but what it seems like ICE has done is basically give out an order to round up as many Iranians as you can, whether or not they\u2019re linked to any threat and then arrest them and deport them, which is very concerning,\u201d said Ryan Costello, policy director of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group.",
      "Homeland Security did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Kashanian's case but have been touting arrests of Iranians. The department announced the arrests of at least 11 Iranians on immigration violations during the weekend of the U.S. missile strikes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, without elaborating, that it arrested seven Iranians at a Los Angeles-area address that \u201chas been repeatedly used to harbor illegal entrants linked to terrorism.\"",
      "The department \"has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden\u2019s fraudulent parole programs or otherwise,\u201d spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said of the 11 arrests. She didn't offer any evidence of terrorist or extremist ties. Her comment on parole programs referred to President Joe Biden's expanded legal pathways to entry, which his successor, Donald Trump, shut down.",
      "Russell Milne, Kashanian\u2019s husband, said his wife is not a threat. Her appeal for asylum was complicated because of \u201cevents in her early life,\" he explained. A court found an earlier marriage of hers to be fraudulent.",
      "But over four decades, Kashanian, 64, built a life in Louisiana. The couple met when she was bartending as a student in the late 1980s. They married and had a daughter. She volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, filmed Persian cooking tutorials on YouTube and was a grandmother figure to the children next door.",
      "The fear of deportation always hung over the family, Milne said, but he said his wife did everything that was being asked of her.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s meeting her obligations,\" Milne said. \"She\u2019s retirement age. She\u2019s not a threat. Who picks up a grandmother?\u201d",
      "While Iranians have been crossing the border illegally for years, especially since 2021, they have faced little risk of being deported to their home countries due to severed diplomatic relations with the U.S. That seems to no longer be the case.",
      "The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, including Iranians, to countries other than their own in an attempt to circumvent diplomatic hurdles with governments that won\u2019t take their people back. During Trump\u2019s second term, countries including El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama have taken back noncitizens from the U.S.",
      "The administration has asked the Supreme Court to clear the way for several deportations to South Sudan, a war-ravaged country with which it has no ties, after the justices allowed deportations to countries other than those noncitizens came from.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol arrested Iranians 1,700 times at the Mexican border from October 2021 through November 2024, according to the most recent public data available. The Homeland Security Department reported that about 600 Iranians overstayed visas as business or exchange visitors, tourists and students in the 12-month period through September 2023, the most recent data reports.",
      "Iran was one of 12 countries subject to a U.S. travel ban that took effect this month. Some fear ICE's growing deportation arrests will be another blow.",
      "In Oregon, an Iranian man was detained by immigration agents this past week while driving to the gym. He was picked up roughly two weeks before he was scheduled for a check-in at ICE offices in Portland, according to court documents filed by his attorney, Michael Purcell.",
      "The man, identified in court filings as S.F., has lived in the U.S. for over 20 years, and his wife and two children are U.S. citizens.",
      "S.F. applied for asylum in the U.S. in the early 2000s, but his application was denied in 2002. His appeal failed but the government did not deport him and he continued to live in the country for decades, according to court documents.",
      "Due to \u201cchanged conditions\u201d in Iran, S.F. would face \u201ca vastly increased danger of persecution\u201d if he were to be deported, Purcell wrote in his petition. \u201cThese circumstances relate to the recent bombing by the United States of Iranian nuclear facilities, thus creating a de facto state of war between the United States and Iran.\u201d",
      "S.F.\u2019s long residency in the U.S., his conversion to Christianity and the fact that his wife and children are U.S. citizens \u201csharply increase the possibility of his imprisonment in Iran, or torture or execution,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Kashanian's daughter said she is worried what will happen to her mother.",
      "\u201cShe tried to do everything right,\u201d Kaitlynn Milne said.",

He died Friday at his home in northern Virginia after a battle with spindle-cell sarcoma, an aggressive form of cancer, according to his son.",

Boucher served as the spokesman for secretaries of state James Baker, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice.",

      "The Florida immigration detention site dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d is being met by opposition from a range of groups concerned with its impacts on local Native American tribes, the Everglades ecosystem and human rights for migrants",
      "A coalition of groups, ranging from environmental activists to Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands, converged outside an airstrip in the Florida Everglades Saturday to protest the imminent construction of an immigrant detention center.",
      "Hundreds of protesters lined part of U.S. Highway 41 that slices through the marshy Everglades \u2014 also known as Tamiami Trail \u2014 as dump trucks hauling materials lumbered into the airfield. Cars passing by honked in support as protesters waved signs calling for the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to a few Native tribes and several endangered animal species.",
      "Christopher McVoy, an ecologist, said he saw a steady stream of trucks entering the site while he protested for hours. Environmental degradation was a big reason why he came out Saturday. But as a South Florida city commissioner, he said concerns over immigration raids in his city also fueled his opposition.",
      "\u201cPeople I know are in tears, and I wasn't far from it,\u201d he said.",
      "Florida officials have forged ahead over the past week in constructing the compound dubbed as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d within the Everglades' humid swamplands.",
      "The government fast-tracked the project under emergency powers from an executive order issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis that addresses what he views as a crisis of illegal immigration. That order lets the state sidestep certain purchasing laws and is why construction has continued despite objections from Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and local activists.",
      "The facility will have temporary structures like heavy-duty tents and trailers to house detained immigrants. The state estimates that by early July, it will have 5,000 immigration detention beds in operation.",
      "The compound's proponents have noted its location in the Florida wetlands \u2014 teeming with massive reptiles like alligators and invasive Burmese pythons \u2014 make it an ideal spot for immigration detention.",
      "\u201cClearly, from a security perspective, if someone escapes, you know, there\u2019s a lot of alligators,\u201d DeSantis said Wednesday. \u201cNo one\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Under DeSantis, Florida has made an aggressive push for immigration enforcement and has been supportive of the federal government's broader crackdown on illegal immigration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has backed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d which DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said will be partially funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "But Native American leaders in the region have seen the construction as an encroachment onto their sacred homelands, which prompted Saturday's protest. In Big Cypress National Preserve, where the airstrip is located, 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, as well as ceremonial and burial grounds and other gathering sites, remain.",
      "Others have raised human rights concerns over what they condemn as the inhumane housing of immigrants. Worries about environmental impacts have also been at the forefront, as groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity and the Friends of the Everglades filed a lawsuit Friday to halt the detention center plans.",
      "\u201cThe Everglades is a vast, interconnected system of waterways and wetlands, and what happens in one area can have damaging impacts downstream,\" Friends of the Everglades executive director Eve Samples said. \u201cSo it's really important that we have a clear sense of any wetland impacts happening in the site.\u201d",
      "Bryan Griffin, a DeSantis spokesperson, said Friday in response to the litigation that the facility was a \u201cnecessary staging operation for mass deportations located at a preexisting airport that will have no impact on the surrounding environment.\u201d",
      "Until the site undergoes a comprehensive environmental review and public comment is sought, the environmental groups say construction should pause. The facility's speedy establishment is \u201cdamning evidence\u201d that state and federal agencies hope it will be \u201ctoo late\u201d to reverse their actions if they are ordered by a court to do so, said Elise Bennett, a Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney working on the case.",
      "The potential environmental hazards also bleed into other aspects of Everglades life, including a robust tourism industry where hikers walk trails and explore the marshes on airboats, said Floridians for Public Lands founder Jessica Namath, who attended the protest. To place an immigration detention center there makes the area unwelcoming to visitors and feeds into the misconception that the space is in \u201cthe middle of nowhere,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEverybody out here sees the exhaust fumes, sees the oil slicks on the road, you know, they hear the sound and the noise pollution. You can imagine what it looks like at nighttime, and we're in an international dark sky area,\u201d Namath said. \u201cIt's very frustrating because, again, there's such disconnect for politicians.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called an assassination and that also left her husband dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded.",
      "Biden also paid his respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul, a few hours after the man charged with killing them while disguised as a police officer June 14 made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit.",
      "The couple\u2019s private funeral, at the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "Neither Biden nor Harris is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman\u2019s adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.",
      "Hortman, a Democrat, was the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans to lay in state at the Capitol. It was the first time a couple has been accorded the honor, and the first for a dog. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. The Hortmans' caskets and the dog's urn were arranged in the center of the rotunda, under the Capitol dome, with law enforcement officers keeping watch as thousands of people filed by. Many fought back tears as they left.",
      "Among the first to pay their respects were Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Biden, a Catholic, visited later in the afternoon, walking up to the velvet rope in front of the caskets, making the sign of the cross and spending a few moments by himself in silence. He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.",
      "Lisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.",
      "\u201cShe was just amazing. Amazing woman. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,\u201d Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. \u201cShe was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.\"",
      "But, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also \u201ca boss.\"",
      "\u201cShe just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen,\u201d she said.",
      "The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called \u201ca political assassination.\u201d",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.",
      "An unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. He agreed. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.",
      "\u201cYour honor, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,\" Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. \"I\u2019ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.\u201d",
      "Atwal told the court that Boelter had been in what's known as a \u201cGumby suit,\u201d without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls and the smell drifts to Boelter's cell.",
      "The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity and let him communicate better.",
      "Boelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans\u2019 home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers\u2019 homes.",
      "His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole.",
      "Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",

      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause",
      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause \u2014 but they do have some leading theories.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency handling the probe, said this week it hopes to conclude the investigation in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe intend for our investigation of this failure to have a lasting impact, save future lives and ensure this never happens again,\u201d NIST investigator Judith Mitrani-Reiser said in the agency's latest report.",
      "Most residents were asleep in the 12-story Champlain Towers South when the beachfront condo building in Surfside, Florida, collapsed into a huge pile of rubble at 1:22 a.m. on June 24, 2021. As the investigation continued, a Miami judge approved a more than $1 billion settlement for personal injury and wrongful death claims from the disaster.",
      "Meanwhile, a new luxury condominium is going up at the Champlain Towers site, a few miles north of Miami.",
      "NIST has zeroed in on what it calls three \u201chigher-likelihood\u201d scenarios, all related to construction flaws that date to the beginning of the 40-year-old structure.",
      "\u201cThese conditions existed from the time construction was complete, 40 years before the partial collapse,\" said Glen Bell, co-lead investigator on NIST\u2019s National Construction Safety Team.",
      "One possibility is the failure of a connection between a building column and the pool deck slab that never met building code standards. Another is that steel reinforcement \u201cwas not placed where it should have been,\u201d which meant the column and pool deck were far too weak.",
      "And a third theory is that work done later around the pool \u2014 when heavy planters, sand and pavers were added \u2014 increased the weight load on a deck \u201cthat was already functionally and structurally inadequate.\u201d",
      "The NIST report also notes that support columns in the building's basement parking garage had been exposed to frequent flooding, which causes corrosion in steel reinforcements and concrete deterioration.",
      "Investigators did not find evidence of voids in the ground under the building, known as \u201ckarst.\u201d Using satellite data, the NIST team found there was no sinking or settling underneath Champlain Towers, which would indicate existence of karst.",
      "In addition, investigators found the limestone upon which the condo was built was \u201csufficient to carry the building loads\" and that testing of the concrete supporting Champlain Towers had \u201cadequate material strength.\u201d",
      "One challenge for investigators was the lack of any available records from the original building construction and not many from its earlier years.",
      "After Surfside, state legislators enacted a law in 2022 requiring condo associations to have sufficient reserves to cover major repairs. Some residents were caught off guard by hefty fees imposed to cover years of deferred maintenance expenses required to bring their buildings into compliance with the law's standards.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis this week signed new legislation allowing some condo associations to fund their reserves through a loan or line of credit. It also gives residents more flexibility to pause payments into reserve funds while they prioritize needed repairs. It extends the deadline for condo associations to complete structural integrity studies and exempts some smaller buildings from those studies.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to make the change,\u201d state Sen. Ed Hooper said. \u201cElderly people are losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase in their monthly HOA fees. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "It's a luxury condo building, dubbed the Delmore, with 37 \u201cmansions in the sky\u201d and a starting price of $15 million. The site was purchased at auction by Dubai-based DAMAC International for $120 million.",
      "According to the company, there will be amenities such as a see-through swimming pool, an indoor pool, an outdoor kitchen, a fitness center and a meditation garden.",
      "The new condo is expected to be completed by 2029.",
      "A design for a memorial to the 98 victims and that honors their families was approved earlier this year by Surfside officials and a family committee. But the city's planning and zoning board objected to its appearance and recommended that alternatives be considered.",
      "The existing proposal envisions a tall \u201cwall of water\u201d and exhibition of materials from the collapsed building. Surfside officials say they want to keep the project on track but will consider additional input, especially from the family committee.",
      "\u201cI understand the urgency. But this memorial is going to be here long beyond anyone in this room,\" said planning board chair Lindsay Lecour at an April city commission meeting.",

      "Fireworks are as American as apple pie",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Like clockwork, Carla Johnson sends out letters every spring asking for donations to help pay for the annual Fourth of July fireworks show that draws tens of thousands of people to New Mexico's largest lake.",
      "And she has no reservations about doling out verbal reminders when she sees her patrons around town. There's too much at stake to be shy about fundraising when donations collected by Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park are what make the tradition possible.",
      "But even Johnson\u2019s ardent efforts as the group's fundraiser might not cut it next year if the U.S. and China remain locked in a trade war.",
      "With nearly all of the aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that fuel America's Fourth of July celebrations being imported from China, volunteer groups like Johnson's and cities big and small have been closely watching the negotiations.",
      "A 90-day pause on what had been massive tariffs brought some temporary relief, but industry experts acknowledge that the tiff has lit a fuse of uncertainty as the price tag for future fireworks displays could skyrocket if an agreement isn\u2019t reached.",
      "There were similar concerns in 2019 as trade talks between the U.S. and China dragged on. Industry groups had called on officials then to exempt fireworks from escalating tariffs.",
      "The American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association reignited the lobbying effort this spring, noting in letters to President Donald Trump that fireworks play a crucial role in American celebrations. The groups say the industry is made up mostly of family-owned companies that are often locked into long-term contracts that leave them unable to raise prices to offset cost surges brought on by higher tariffs.",
      "And there are few options for sourcing the more than 300 million pounds (136 million kilograms) of fireworks needed to feed demands. China produces 99% of consumer fireworks and 90% of professional display fireworks used in the U.S., according to the APA.",
      "\u201cI think overall it\u2019s the uncertainty,\u201d said Julie Heckman, the APA's executive director. \u201cYeah, we have a 90-day pause, but are the negotiations with China going to go well? Or is it going to go sky-high again? You know, triple digits. It\u2019s very hard for a small business to plan.\"",
      "Fireworks have their roots in China. To ward off evil spirits, people would throw bamboo stalks into a fire, causing them to pop as the air inside the hollow pockets heated up. These early firecrackers evolved into more sophisticated fireworks after the Chinese developed gunpowder in the 9th century.",
      "By the 15th century, Europe was using fireworks for religious festivals and entertainment. In 1777, they were used in Philadelphia and Boston for what were the first organized Independence Day celebrations.",
      "Now, fireworks are synonymous with the summer holiday and with ringing in the new year. Shows have become elaborately choreographed displays that are often synced to live music. In Nashville, the Music City's award-winning symphony orchestra puts its own spin on the festivities.",
      "In New York City, organizers of the Macy's show will fire off 80,000 shells, with some reaching heights of 1,000 feet (304 meters). The National Park Service promises a spectacular show on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.",
      "At Elephant Butte in southern New Mexico, they're going old school and will light the fireworks by hand. Charlie Warren, vice president of the Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park, said it's like spectators are getting two shows at once as the colors reflect on the water below and the loud booms reverberate off the lake.",
      "Johnson, who also serves as the group's treasurer, gets emotional describing the experience.",
      "\u201cOh man, in my heart and sometimes out loud, I\u2019m singing the Star-Spangled Banner. I\u2019ll sing it out loud to the top of my lungs when I watch that show,\" she said. \u201cIt makes you proud to be in this country, and we\u2019re celebrating our freedom, and I\u2019m going to start crying now. Don\u2019t get me started.\u201d",
      "Organizers in Nashville ordered fireworks for that show over a year ago so they weren't affected by the tariffs. It was the same in one of New Mexico's largest cities, where Rio Rancho officials planned to spend a little more to go bigger and higher this year.",
      "In Oklahoma, Big Blast Fireworks supplies nonprofit groups so they can fundraise by setting up fireworks stands. The company received its first container from China in January before the tariffs hit. The second container arrived in February and was subject to a 10% tariff. The third container was put on hold to avoid the highest tariffs, meaning inventory could be tight later this year if nothing changes.",
      "\u201cAs a small business, we are passionate about watching our price points and intentional about passing along as much savings on to customers as possible,\" said Melissa Torkleson, a managing partner at Big Blast.",
      "With some orders on hold, industry experts say Chinese manufacturers throttled back production as warehouses filled up. The backup in the supply chain also has resulted in competition for shipping space aboard ocean vessels, and Heckman, the APA's director, said it will take much more than flipping a light switch to ease either situation.",
      "If the trade war drags on, she said, there are ways that show organizers can adjust and spectators might not notice. A minute or two could be shaved from a show or certain types of fireworks could be substituted with less expensive options.",
      "As for this year, Warren said the price tag for the Elephant Butte show was unchanged and he and Johnson can't wait to see spectators lining the shoreline, on the surrounding hillsides and on boats bobbing on the lake. The mission every year is to make sure \u201cthat the T's are all crossed,\" Warren said.",
      "\"Because this community would not be happy if this show didn\u2019t come off,\u201d he said.",

      "Child safety advocates are warning about the dangers of heatstroke from leaving kids in hot cars",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A record heat wave that spread across the East Coast of the United States during the first week of summer has child advocates warning parents and caretakers about the risks of heatstroke to children left inside hot vehicles.",
      "So far this year, nine children have died after being left unattended in vehicles in California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New Jersey and North Carolina, according to Kids and Car Safety, which collects data on hot car deaths. Five died in June.",
      "And last year, 39 children in the U.S. died after being left in hot cars.",
      "Human-caused climate change keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists say. But the temperature outside doesn't have to be super hot for a child left in a vehicle to be affected by the heat, said Kathy Wall, director of Safe Kids Palm Beach County.",
      "\u201cInside, the vehicle can heat up 20 degrees in just 20 minutes,\u201d Wall said. \u201cSo if you imagine it\u2019s an 80 degree day, which in South Florida is a cool day, it could be over 100 degrees within 10 minutes inside the car.\"",
      "Hot car deaths can happen any time of year, and since 1998, every state but Alaska has reported a hot car death, according to the National Safety Council. In both 2018 and 2019, a record 53 children died after being left in hot cars.",
      "About 80% of the heat rise in vehicles happens in the first 30 minutes of a child being left inside, when maximum temperatures can exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), according to data compiled by Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist at San Jose State University.",
      "\u201cChildren sweat a lot less than adults do and their internal temperature can increase three to five times faster than an adult. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s just as important to make sure that your child isn\u2019t left in the vehicle, especially during these rising temperatures,\" said Capt. Karen Derogatis of Palm Beach County Fire Rescue.",
      "While it\u2019s easy to place blame for leaving a child in a vehicle, even people trained to know the dangers have made that tragic mistake, Wall said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a socioeconomic group, it\u2019s not a cultural group,\u201d she said. \u201cThis sadly has happened to doctors, it\u2019s happened to dentists, it happened to school teachers, it\u2019s happened to child care workers. Nobody is exempt from this.\u201d",
      "Distraction often leads to forgetting about a child in the backseat, which is why it is important to create routines and reminders, she said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds crazy, but sometimes people get out of routines or are distracted, especially in today\u2019s world. There\u2019s lots going on in the news, lots going with families,\u201d she said.",
      "A parent who normally doesn't drop a child off at a day care facility might become distracted and forget that the child is in the vehicle, she said.",
      "She encourages parents and caregivers to establish routines.",
      "\u201cWe have an acronym, ACT,\" Wall said.",
      "A stands for avoiding leaving a child unattended in a vehicle.",
      "C stands for creating a reminder that works best for you. Authorities suggest leaving a personal item such as a purse or briefcase in the backseat so you'll have to open the back door before locking the vehicle.",
      "T is to take action right away. \u201cIf you see a child in a car, don\u2019t try to figure out how long they\u2019ve been in the car. Call 911 immediately,\" Wall said.",
      "Some newer cars offer warnings for drivers to check the backseat for passengers.",
      "Double checking the vehicle is key, said Derogatis, the fire captain.",

      "She wore the shirt during a Juneteenth performance on her Cowboy Carter tour.",
      "A T-shirt worn by Beyonc\u00e9 during a Juneteenth performance on her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d tour has sparked a discussion over how Americans frame their history and caused a wave of criticism for the Houston-born superstar.",
      "The T-shirt worn during a concert in Paris featured images of the Buffalo Soldiers, who belonged to Black U.S. Army units active during the late 1800s and early 1900s. On the back was a lengthy description of the soldiers that included \u201ctheir antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.\u201d",
      "Images of the shirt and videos of the performance are also featured on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s website.",
      "As she prepares to return to the U.S. for performances in her hometown this weekend, fans and Indigenous influencers took to social media to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 for wearing a shirt that frames Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries as anything but the victims of American imperialism and for promoting anti-Indigenous language.",
      "A spokesperson for Beyonc\u00e9 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Buffalo Soldiers served in six military units created after the Civil War in 1866. They were comprised of formerly enslaved men, freemen, and Black Civil War soldiers and fought in hundreds of conflicts \u2014 including in the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II \u2014 until they were disbanded in 1951.",
      "As the quote on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s shirt notes, they also fought numerous battles against Indigenous peoples as part of the U.S. Army's campaign of violence and land theft during the country's westward expansion.",
      "Some historians say the moniker \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d was bestowed by the tribes who admired the bravery and tenacity of the fighters, but that might be more legend than fact. \u201cAt the end of the day, we really don\u2019t have that kind of information,\u201d said Cale Carter, director of exhibitions at the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston.",
      "Carter and other museum staff said that, only in the past few years, the museum made broader efforts to include more of the complexities of the battles the Buffalo Soldiers fought against Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries and the role they played in the subjugation of Indigenous peoples. They, much like many other museums across the country, are hoping to add more nuance to the framing of American history and be more respectful of the ways they have caused harm to Indigenous communities.",
      "\u201cWe romanticize the Western frontier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early stories that talked about the Buffalo Soldiers were impacted by a lot of those factors. So you really didn\u2019t see a changing in that narrative until recently.\u201d",
      "There has often been a lack of diverse voices discussing how the history of the Buffalo Soldiers is framed, said Michelle Tovar, the museum's director of education. The current political climate has put enormous pressure on schools, including those in Texas, to avoid honest discussions about American history, she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, in this area, we are getting pushback from a lot of school districts in which we can\u2019t go and teach this history,\" Tovar said. \"We are a museum where we can at least be a hub, where we can invite the community regardless of what districts say, invite them to learn it and do what we can do the outreach to continue to teach honest history.\u201d",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's recent album \u201cAct II: Cowboy Carter\u201d has played on a kind of American iconography, which many see as her way of subverting the country music genre's adjacency to whiteness and reclaiming the cowboy aesthetic for Black Americans. Last year, she became the first Black woman ever to top Billboard's country music chart, and \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d won her the top prize at the 2025 Grammy Awards, album of the year.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers play this major role in the Black ownership of the American West,\u201d said Tad Stoermer, a historian and professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIn my view, (Beyonc\u00e9 is) well aware of the role that these images play. This is the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 tour for crying out loud. The entire tour, the entire album, the entire piece is situated in this layered narrative.\u201d",
      "But Stoermer also points out that the Buffalo Soldiers have been framed in the American story in a way that also plays into the myths of American nationalism.",
      "As Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Buffalo Soldiers imagery implies, Black Americans also use their story to claim agency over their role in the creation of the country, said Alaina E. Roberts, a historian, author and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies the intersection of Black and Native American life from the Civil War to present day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the category in which she thought maybe she was coming into this conversation, but the Buffalo Soldiers are even a step above that because they were literally involved in not just the settlement of the West but of genocide in a sense,\u201d she said.",
      "Several Native influencers, performers, and academics took to social media this week to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 or decry the shirt's language as anti-Indigenous. \u201cDo you think Beyonc\u00e9 will apologize (or acknowledge) the shirt?\u201d indigenous.tv, an Indigenous news and culture Instagram account with more than 130,000 followers, asked in a post Thursday.",
      "Many of her critics, as well as fans, agree. A flood of social media posts called out the pop star for the historic framing on the shirt.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers are an interesting historical moment to look at. But we have to be honest about what they did, especially in their operations against Indigenous Americans and Mexicans,\u201d said Chisom Okorafor, who posts on TikTok under the handle @confirmedsomaya.",
      "Okorafor said there is no \u201cprogressive\u201d way to reclaim America's history of empire building in the West, and that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Western symbolism sends a problematic message: \u201cThat Black people, too, can engage in American nationalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack people, too, can profit from the atrocities of (the) American empire,\u201d she said. \"It is a message that tells you to abandon immigrants, Indigenous people, and people who live outside of the United States. It is a message that tells you not only is it a virtue to have been born in this country, but the longer your line extends in this country, the more virtuous you are.\u201d",

      "For Kondabolu, this moment is not just exciting, but emotional.",
      "\u201cI think so many of us have had those experiences in New York of being brown and in a city that has always been really diverse and feels like ours. But after 9/11, like you start to question it like, is this our city too,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cAnd 25 years later ... it\u2019s surreal, like this is the same city but it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve elected this person.\u201d",
      "Mamdani's campaign has piqued the interest of many Indian, Pakistani and other South Asian Americans, as well as Muslims \u2014 even those who may not agree with Mamdani on every issue. Despite that opposition, some still see his rise as a sign of hope in a city where racism and xenophobia erupted following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Many of New York City's over 300,000 South Asian residents have been inspired by Mamdani\u2019s extraordinary trajectory.",
      "\u201cMy mom was texting her friends to vote for him. I\u2019ve never seen my mother do that before,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cSo the idea that it\u2019s gotten our whole family activated in this way \u2014 this is, like, personal.\u201d",
      "Snigdha Sur, founder and CEO of The Juggernaut, an online publication reporting on South Asians, has been fascinated by the response from some people in India and the diaspora.",
      "\u201cSo many global South Asians ... they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this guy is my mayor and I don\u2019t live in New York City,\u2019\u201d Sur said.",
      "At the same time, some are also concerned or angered by Mamdani's past remarks about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who he publicly called a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d",
      "In Michigan, Thasin Sardar has been following Mamdani\u2019s ascent online. When he first heard him, he struck him as \u201cgenuine\u201d and he felt \u201can instant connection,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs a Muslim American, this victory puts my trust back in the people,\u201d said Sardar, who was born and raised in India. \u201cI am happy that there are people who value the candidate and his policies more than his personal religious beliefs and didn\u2019t vote him down because of the color of his skin, or the fact that he was an immigrant with an uncommon name.\u201d",
      "New York voter Zainab Shabbir said family members in California, and beyond, have also excitedly taken note.",
      "\u201cMy family in California, they were very much like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so nice to see a South Asian Muslim candidate be a mayor of a major city,\u2019\u201d she said. A brother told her Mamdani\u2019s rise is a great example for his kids, she said.",
      "But the 34-year-old \u2014 who donated, voted and canvassed for Mamdani \u2014 said it was his vision for New York City that was the draw for her. She and her husband briefly chatted with Mamdani at a fundraiser and she found him to be \u201cvery friendly and genuine.\u201d",
      "She suspects that for some who aren\u2019t very politically active, Mamdani\u2019s political ascent could make a difference.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Muslim communities like my parents\u2019 generation who are focused a lot more on the politics back home and less on the politics here in America,\u201d said Shabbir. \u201cSeeing people like Zohran Mamdani be in office, it\u2019ll really change that perspective in a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Supporters and pundits agree that Mamdani's campaign has demonstrated social media savvy and authenticity. He visited multiple mosques. In videos, he speaks in Hindi or gives a touch of Bollywood. Other South Asian American politicians such as Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna praised that.",
      "\u201cI love that he didn\u2019t run away from his heritage. I mean, he did video clips with Amitabh Bachchan and Hindi movies,\u201d Khanna said, referencing the Indian actor. \u201cHe shows that one can embrace their roots and their heritage and yet succeed in American politics.\u201d",
      "But his triumph also reflects \u201cthe urgency of the economic message, the challenge that people are facing in terms of rent, in terms of the cost of living, and how speaking to that is so powerful,\u201d the progressive California Democrat added.",
      "Tanzeela Rahman, a daughter of Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh, said she grew up \u201cvery low income\u201d in New York.",
      "\u201cI felt seen by him in a way politicians have not seen me ever,\u201d the 29-year-old financial systems analyst said. \u201cI think very few people in government understand \u2026 how hard it is to survive in New York City.\u201d",
      "She found Mamdani to be \u201cunabashedly Muslim\u201d and also \u201ca voice, who, literally, to me sounds like a New Yorker who\u2019s stepping in and saying, hey, let\u2019s reclaim our power,\u201d she said.",
      "While Mamdani has been speaking to the working class, he had a somewhat privileged upbringing. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.",
      "He lived in Queens but attended The Bronx High School of Science. Even as a teen, he cared about social justice, Kondabolu, the comedian, recalled.",
      "His campaign messaging on issues such as affordable housing and free bus rides might not resonate with South Asian households in New York City who have income levels above the median. But, the irony is that his campaign and \u201cgreat kind of soundbites\u201d earned support from that demographic, too, according to Sur.",
      "\u201cIt was, I think, a surprise that he did so well among the wealthiest, including his own community,\u201d Sur said.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s outspoken support for Palestinian causes and criticism of Israel and its military campaign in Gaza resonated with pro-Palestinian residents, including Muslims, but caused tension in the mayor\u2019s race. Some of his positions and remarks on the charged issue have drawn recriminations from opponents and some Jewish groups, though he\u2019s also been endorsed by some Jewish politicians and activists.",
      "Mamdani's success immediately elicited strong anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric from some high-profile conservatives on social media, including conservative media personality Charlie Kirk who posted that \u201clegal immigration can ruin your country.\u201d In response, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress, tweeted \u201cFor years they sold people the lie of \u2018we have no problem if you come the right way!\u2019\u201d",
      "His supporters aren't concerned that racism and Islamophobia will distract from Mamdani's campaign. Those feelings clearly weren't \u201cenough for him to lose\u201d the primary, Kondabolu said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a new generation that wants their voice heard and that generation came out in full force, not just by voting, but by, like, getting all these other people to be emotionally invested in this candidate,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cThat\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d",

      "Here's what to know about the case and its potential impacts:",
      "The decision was not a final ruling in the case. It reversed lower-court rulings that sided with the Montgomery County school system, which introduced the storybooks in 2022 as part of an effort to better reflect the district\u2019s diversity.",
      "At first, the school district allowed parents to opt their children out of the lessons for religious and other reasons, but the district later reversed course, saying it became disruptive. The move prompted protests and eventually a lawsuit.",
      "Now, the case goes back to the lower court to be reevaluated under the Supreme Court \u2019s new guidance. But the justices strongly suggested that the parents will win in the end.",
      "The court ruled that policies like the one at issue in this case are subjected to the strictest level of review, nearly always dooming them.",

      "Levinson said the majority opinion's emphasis on the content of the books at the center of the case, including \u201cUncle Bobby\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a story about a two men getting married, could narrow its impact.",

      "Zimmerman has lived in Montgomery County for 16 years and wanted to raise his son and daughter there, in large part, because of the school district's diversity. It was important to him, he said, that his kids be exposed to people from all walks of life.",

      "A California Energy Commission official is recommending a pause on Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California should pause Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high, a top energy regulator said Friday while unveiling proposals aimed at addressing high gas prices.",
      "The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 giving the California Energy Commission the authority to penalize oil companies for excess profits, declaring the state had \u201cfinally beat big oil.\u201d More than two years later, the commission hasn't imposed a single penalty or determined what counts as an excessive profit.",
      "Now, Siva Gunda, the energy commission's vice-chair, says the state should pause the effort in favor of pursuing other policies to lower prices and maintain a steady oil supply \u2014 all while pushing to phase out reliance on fossil fuels over the next two decades.",
      "\u201cTogether, we will evolve California\u2019s strategy to successfully phase out petroleum-based fuels by 2045 while protecting communities, workers, and consumers, and foster market conditions that support the industry\u2019s ability to operate safely, reliably, and successfully to meet demand through the transition,\u201d Gunda wrote in a letter to Newsom.",
      "Gunda's recommended pause of the penalty would have to be agreed upon by the full commission. Newsom has pitched the penalty as a way to rein in profits by oil companies, but critics said it would only raise prices.",
      "California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.61 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.",
      "The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance, Gunda said. That proposal came out of a law Newsom signed last year after convening a special session aimed at preventing gas price spikes.",
      "Gunda's recommendations come months after Newsom in April directed energy regulators to work with refiners on plans to ensure the state maintains a reliable fuel supply as it transitions away from fossil fuels.",

      "Two major oil companies announced plans over the past year to shut down refineries in the state, further driving uncertainty about how the state should maintain a stable fuel supply as California transitions toward renewable energy. Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Los Angeles-area refinery, and Valero said it would cease operations at its Benicia refinery. The two refineries combined account for more than 17% of the state's refining capacity, according to the energy commission.",
      "A group of about 50 environmental and consumer groups penned a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Friday criticizing the proposal to pause implementing a penalty on oil company profits.",

The session unfolded while Hobbs\u2019 2026 bid to hold the reins of the battleground state loomed large.",
      "Hobbs began the session with an uphill climb, confronting expanded Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Arizona is one of eight states where the governor\u2019s office and legislature are controlled by opposing parties.",

      "On Wednesday, Hobbs vetoed the proposal favored by House Republicans and the continuation measure, calling them partisan and reckless.",

      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has signed legislation that provides public funding to renovate Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,\u201d Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.",
      "Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Diamondbacks, praised the governor and said the team will now turn its attention to extending its lease with Maricopa County.",
      "The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.",
      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",
      "The Oakland A's, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "NFL coach Jim Harbaugh has been added to a lawsuit against the University of Michigan and a former assistant football coach who is accused of hacking into the computer accounts of college athletes to look for intimate photos",
      "DETROIT -- NFL coach Jim Harbaugh was added Friday to a lawsuit against the University of Michigan and a former assistant football coach who is accused of hacking into the computer accounts of college athletes across the U.S. to look for intimate photos.",
      "Attorneys claim Harbaugh, who was Michigan's coach, and others knew that Matt Weiss was seen viewing private information on a computer in December 2022 but still allowed him to continue working as co-offensive coordinator in a national playoff game roughly a week later.",
      "Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel and other officials were also added to the lawsuit in federal court in Detroit.",
      "\u201cThe university's delay in taking meaningful protective action until after a high-stakes game sends a clear message: Student welfare was secondary,\u201d said Parker Stinar, who is the lead lawyer in a class-action lawsuit arising from a criminal investigation of Weiss.",
      "Messages seeking comment from Manuel and Harbaugh, who is currently the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, were not immediately returned Friday.",
      "Separately, Weiss has been charged with identity theft and unauthorized computer access from 2015 to 2023. The indictment says he got access to the social media, email and cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 college athletes, as well as more than 1,300 students or alumni from schools across the U.S., to find private images, primarily of women. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "\u201cHad Harbaugh implemented basic oversight of his staff, plaintiffs and the class would have been protected against predators such as Weiss,\u201d the updated lawsuit states. \u201cInstead, Weiss was a highly compensated asset that was promoted by and within the football program, from which position he was able to, and did, target female student athletes.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says a staff member saw Weiss viewing private information at Schembechler Hall, headquarters for the football team, around Dec. 21, 2022, and reported it before Michigan played Texas Christian University in a playoff game days later on Dec. 31.",
      "Weiss was fired a few weeks later in January 2023 during an investigation of his computer use.",
      "Earlier this year, after charges were filed, Harbaugh told reporters that he didn't know anything about Weiss' troubles until after the playoff game. He said the allegations were \"shocking.\"",
      "Weiss worked for Harbaugh's brother, John, on the coaching staff of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens before joining the Michigan team in 2021.",
      "The lawsuit says Weiss\u2019 university computer had encryption software that had to be disabled by an external vendor as part of the investigation. Authorities disclosed in April that thousands of intimate photos and videos were found on his electronic devices and cloud storage accounts.",

      "Thousands of motorists have been stranded in West Virginia after a mudslide sent water and debris onto highway",
      "Thousands of motorists were stranded for more than eight hours along a section of rural interstate highway in southern West Virginia early Friday after a mudslide caused by heavy rains blocked a storm drain the previous night, flooding the northbound lanes.",
      "Traffic backed up for 12 miles (about 19 kilometers) along the West Virginia Turnpike about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Charleston, the state capital. Traffic was not rerouted, and many motorists along the mountainous route had no choice but to remain in their vehicles overnight.",
      "Motorists posted on social media that they had no information on why the standstill occurred, that they had nothing to drink in their vehicles or that their children needed to use the bathroom.",
      "Nicky Walters said in a telephone interview that she felt fortunate while she was stuck because she is healthy, did not not need medicine and had nobody she was responsible for caring for.",
      "\u201cBut I felt desperate because I knew that other people needed help,\u201d said Walters, who became stranded while returning to Charleston from a pro wrestling event in Mount Hope. \u201cPeople needed, at minimum, water bottles passed out and some snacks, much less information. They needed any lifeline to the outside world, and there was none.\u201d",
      "Chuck Smith, executive director of the West Virginia Parkways Authority, said one lane reopened Friday morning but traffic remained at a standstill for hours.",
      "\u201cTraffic should have been detoured to allow drivers an alternate route around the mudslide,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cThe Parkways Authority takes full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, and would like to assure the public that this will never happen again.\u201d",
      "No injuries were reported.",
      "By the time Brittany Lemon and her family finally got home to Parkersburg, 24 hours had passed since they began returning from their vacation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.",
      "In a video posted to Facebook, Lemon said she had no water and her children needed to use the bathroom. They were able to get an hour's sleep while stuck on the highway.",
      "\u201cDefinitely next year when I go back, I\u2019ll be prepared for an emergency in the vehicle,\" she said.",
      "Mitch Carmichael, a former cabinet secretary of the Department of Economic Development, said on Facebook that he was on the turnpike \u201cfor hours with no relevant or timely info as to when issue will be cleared.\u201d",

      "Antoine Massey, 33, was taken into custody at a residence in New Orleans about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the jail, said New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick.",
      "\u201cHe actually walked out of a home peacefully,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cHe peacefully gave up to law enforcement who had surrounded the house.\u201d",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she had received a tip Friday morning and immediately notified other law enforcement authorities, who arrested Massey by midafternoon.",
      "Louisiana State Police Superintendent Robert Hodges said authorities were still investigating how Massey was able to stay at the residence where he was recaptured.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious over the last six weeks to remain a fugitive that long, he had assistance, he had help,\u201d Hodges said.",
      "Authorities had recently investigated social media posts by a man who identified himself as Massey and earlier this month raided a New Orleans home where they believed the videos were produced but did not find him.",
      "\u201cGreat work by all our law enforcement partners who have been working so hard for this outcome,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after Massey's capture Friday. \u201cOne more to go!\u201d",
      "Authorities are still searching for convicted murderer Derrick Groves. Police previously captured the other eight escapees following the May 16 jailbreak, one of the largest in recent U.S. history. Authorities said the men yanked open a faulty cell door inside the New Orleans jail, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the dark.",
      "The men's absence wasn\u2019t discovered until a morning headcount, hours after they bolted for freedom. Authorities found a message drawn around the hole the men used to escape: an arrow pointing at the gap and the words \u201cTo Easy LoL.\u201d",
      "Officials have pointed to multiple security lapses in the jail, but authorities remain adamant that the men also had likely had help. A maintenance worker at the jail was arrested for allegedly helping the men escape by turning off the water to the toilet where the hole was cut behind. His lawyer says he has denied knowingly aiding them.",
      "Massey faced charges of rape, kidnapping, domestic violence involving strangulation and violation of a protective order, authorities in nearby St. Tammany Parish said. In Orleans Parish, he faced charges of motor vehicle theft and domestic battery.",
      "Murrill said Massey will face additional charges for his role in the escape.",
      "A woman police identified as being in an on-again, off-again relationship with Massey was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice and as a principal to aggravated escape, court records show. Authorities said the woman knew of Massey\u2019s escape plans beforehand, communicated with him afterward and misled authorities.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday struck down another of President Donald Trump's executive orders targeting law firms.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled that the order against the firm of Susman Godfrey was unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked.",
      "The order was the latest ruling to reject Trump's efforts to punish law firms for legal work he does not like and for employing attorneys he perceives as his adversaries. Susman Godfrey suggested that it had drawn Trump's ire at least in part because it represented Dominion Voting Systems in the voting machine company's defamation lawsuit against Fox News over false claims surrounding the 2020 presidential election. The suit ended in a massive settlement.",
      "Other judges in recent weeks have blocked similar orders against the firms of Jenner & Block, Perkins Coie and WilmerHale. The orders have sought to impose similar sanctions, including the suspension of security clearances of attorneys and the restriction of access to federal buildings.",
      "\u201cThe order was one in a series attacking firms that had taken positions with which President Trump disagreed. In the ensuing months, every court to have considered a challenge to one of these orders has found grave constitutional violations and permanently enjoined enforcement of the order in full,\" AliKhan wrote. \u201cToday, this court follows suit, concluding that the order targeting Susman violates the U.S. Constitution and must be permanently enjoined.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the firm called the ruling \u201ca resounding victory for the rule of law and the right of every American to be represented by legal counsel without fear of retaliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe applaud the Court for declaring the administration\u2019s order unconstitutional. Our firm is committed to the rule of law and to protecting the rights of our clients without regard to their political or other beliefs. Susman Godfrey\u2019s lawyers and staff live these values every day,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Other major firms have sought to avert orders by preemptively reaching settlements that require them, among other things, to collectively dedicate hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services in support of causes the Trump administration says it supports.",

      "A federal appeals court is staying a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with dismantling the U.S. Institute of Peace",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court panel on Friday stayed a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with dismantling the U.S. Institute of Peace, an organization taken over in March by the Department of Government Efficiency, then led by Elon Musk.",
      "The three-judge panel with the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit issued the stay, saying the Trump administration's appeal of U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell's opinion would likely succeed on the merits. The stay added that the president would face \u201cirreparable harm from not being able to fully exercise his executive powers.\u201d",
      "In filings with the higher court supporting its request for an appeal and a stay of Howell\u2019s order, the government argued that \u201cas evidenced by its programmatic, grant making and peacebuilding activities, USIP\u201d was exercising \u201cconsiderable executive power.\u201d The filings also went on to explain the board members are \u201csubject to the president\u2019s at-will removal authority.\u201d",
      "In issuing the stay, the appeals court agreed and said the nonprofit think tank that focuses on peace initiatives is engaged in activities that fall under the purview of the executive branch.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a great victory for the American taxpayer. As we have said time and again, the President has the right to manage entities within the Executive Branch \u2014 including the so-called \u2018Institute of Peace,\u2019 which cost taxpayers over $50 million per year while failing to deliver peace,\u201d said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. \u201cThe President looks forward to continuing to implement his government efficiency agenda.\u201d",
      "The appeal's court action is the latest turn in the government's shutdown of the USIP, which had been turned back over to the organization's board and acting president following Howell's May 19 ruling. It also places the staff's attempt at restarting its operations in limbo.",
      "President Donald Trump issued the executive order in February that targeted the institute and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the federal government. The first attempt by DOGE to take over the headquarters led to a standoff. Members of Musk\u2019s DOGE group returned days later with the FBI and Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police to help them gain entry.",
      "The institute and many of its board members sued the Trump administration March 18, seeking to prevent their removal and to prevent DOGE from taking over its operations. The firing of the board was followed by a Friday night mass firing by email on March 28, which threw the workforce into turmoil. DOGE transferred the administrative oversight of the organization\u2019s headquarters and assets to the General Services Administration that weekend.",
      "Howell, in a lengthy opinion in May, reversed the action when she determined the organization was not part of the executive branch and therefore Trump did not have authority to fire its board and acting president. She ruled that all subsequent actions, including the firing of most of the staff, the cessation of operations and the takeover of its headquarters and assets, were illegal as well.",
      "Howell denied a government request for a stay of her opinion while the government appeals, a move that led acting president George Moose and others to reclaim the headquarters and begin trying to ramp USIP's operations back up. Those efforts have been slow going, with much of the staff still furloughed and operations in parts of the world shut down.",
      "It was unclear Friday if there would be another change of hands of the headquarters.",
      "A press statement from the organization said \u201cwe will continue to fight for USIP\u2019s right to fulfill its commitment to our congressional mandate and to control USIP\u2019s headquarters, funds, and operations to the fullest extent of the law. We remain confident we will prevail in this case and we look forward to continuing our critical work both at our headquarters in Washington, DC and in conflict zones around the world.\"",

      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",
      "In her rebuttal, Comey said, \"Being a domestic abuser is not a defense to sex trafficking.\"",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberating on Monday.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",
      "The defense\u00a0rested\u00a0on Tuesday after presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. It didn't call any witnesses.",
      "Combs' lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "In federal prosecutors' closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury that Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",
      "\"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \"Mission: Impossible\" and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",
      "In addition to his sons, he's survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

      "Her sixth album, \"Princess of Power,\" comes after the artist \u2014 born Marina Diamandis \u2014 recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome while rebuilding her relationship with music and her identity.",
      "MARINA has scored billions of streams without ever having a top 10 single in the U.K. or U.S., yet her influence runs deep among a generation of artists including Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. \"I think artists who are very commercially successful, like they'll have these peaks and troughs and mine's kind of like been like steadily going up,\" MARINA said.",

      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",

      "The prosecution and defense rested their cases Tuesday in the sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.",
      "The prosecution rested after calling more than 30 witnesses, including former employees and male escorts. Two former girlfriends, including\u00a0Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura\u00a0and a woman using the pseudonym \"Jane\" took the stand and told the jury they did not want to participate in so-called \"freak offs,\" described as drug fueled sexual encounters with male escorts they said Combs would direct.",
      "Jurors saw pictures of guns, drugs, baby oil and other lubricant, and they saw a video of a 2016 Los Angeles hotel incident\u00a0during which Combs was seen attacking Ventura.",
      "On cross-examination, the defense showed texts and other messages, arguing it showed the women were willing participants.",
      "As soon as the prosecution rested, Combs' defense team moved for acquittal, claiming the government failed to meet its burden in proving the charges. The judge said he'd reserve judgment on the motion.",
      "\"You're doing an excellent job,\" Combs tells judge",
      "Combs' defense team did not call any witnesses.",
      "The judge asked Combs how he was doing, and Combs replied he was doing great.",
      "\"You're doing an excellent job,\" Combs told the judge.",
      "The judge then asked Combs about his decision not to testify.",
      "\"That is my decision, your honor,\" Combs said Tuesday. \"That is solely my decision.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys entered exhibits, including law enforcement notes of interviews, then rested.",
      "\"I don't see what the upside would have been for the defense to put him on the stand to try and quibble about the technicalities of the claims against him, and then he would be cross-examined for days about every bad thing he did,\" said attorney Richard Schoenstein, who is not involved in the case.",
      "About the charges",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts and faces up to life in prison if he's convicted.",
      "The first count is racketeering conspiracy, which alleges combs \"abused, threatened and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.\" Prosecutors allege Combs relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in, or attempted to engage in, \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "The other four counts are sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "\"I think they've proved that prostitutes were moved from one state to another and that Diddy was involved,\" Schoenstein said.",
      "Schoenstein said the other counts are more debatable.",
      "\"Sex trafficking by force, and that's going to be more of an assessment of what the relationships between Diddy and Cassie and what Diddy and Jane were like and what the jury thinks of all that,\" Schoenstein said.",
      "Closing arguments are set for Thursday at 9 a.m. Attorneys indicated that closing arguments may take all day Thursday and Friday, meaning that deliberations may not begin until Monday.",
      "The trial is in its seventh week.\u00a0A juror was dismissed as the prosecution neared the end of its case over questions about where that juror actually lived. And rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, stopped by the trial to observe the proceedings briefly at one point.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",

      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",

Berkshire Hathaway owns Geico, Dairy Queen and a range of other businesses, and Buffett is donating nearly 12.4 million of the Class B shares of its stock.

      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, inched higher in May, the latest sign that inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, according to the PCE data. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, up from a rate of 2.5% the previous month.",
      "While inflation ticked higher, prices across the U.S. haven't yet shown a major impact from the Trump administration's tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned earlier this week that inflation could reignite this summer as the import duties are passed through to consumers.",
      "Consumers also pared their spending last month, marking their first reduction since January, while incomes also dropped, the Commerce Department\u00a0said\u00a0on Friday. The pullback in spending, which dropped 0.1% last month, comes after Americans opened their wallets earlier in the year to buy goods before the tariffs took effect, economists said.",
      "\"While the spending numbers fell slightly and came in below expectations, we would not read too much into these numbers as this weakness is probably primarily just payback from the jump in spending earlier this year as consumers tried to buy goods ahead of the tariffs,\" Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Incomes dropped after a one-time adjustment to Social Security benefits had boosted payments in March and April. Social Security payments were raised for some retirees who had worked for state and local governments due to the Social Security Fairness Act.",
      "Modest impact from tariffs",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Trump's broad-based tariffs are still having only a modest effect on prices. The cost of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month's 0.1%.",
      "Economists point to several reasons why Trump's tariffs have yet to accelerate the pace of inflation, as many analysts had expected. Like American consumers, companies imported billions of dollars of goods in the spring before the duties kicked in, and many items currently on store shelves were imported without paying higher levies.",
      "Some businesses are also absorbing higher import costs, cushioning consumers from price hikes.",
      "\"For the moment, there is nothing of consequence to worry about on the inflation side of this report,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told clients in a research note. \"There is, however, an unexpected drop in consumer spending, the first since the pandemic.

      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event.",
      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony expected to take place Friday, according to local media reports.",
      "The duo were sighted earlier this week as they arrived via taxi-boat at the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal in Venice.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "Details on the wedding location of have remained under wraps, but Italian papers and Venetian locals predict it will take place Friday on San Giorgio Maggiore. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "The reception is expected to be held on Saturday at Arsenale, a sprawling brick complex and former shipyard that was used from the 12th century until World War I. It's best known today as one of the main venues for the Biennale cultural festivals, which include exhibitions on art, architecture, film, dance, music and theater.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "The event has put a spotlight on the uber-weathly, with local protestors pushing back against the event's extravagance.",
      "\"Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,\" Stella Faye, a university researcher from Venice,\u00a0told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "According to a new Oxfam report, the world's richest 1% have increased their wealth by more than $33.9 trillion since 2015. The report also found that a group of 3,000 billionaires, which includes Bezos, have increased their wealth by $6.5 trillion in real terms since 2015. That's equivalent to 14.6% of global GDP.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion).",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports.",
      "The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests including Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, the Kardashian sisters, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, The Associated Press reported.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protesters gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated.",
      "\"We will always respect the right to speak out, but we reject every form of intolerance and prejudice,\" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in Thursday's edition of Italian newspaper Il Foglio Quotidiano. \"No one in Venice can claim the right of deciding who can enter, who can love, who can celebrate.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",

      "President Trump said at a White House event Thursday that Washington and Beijing had signed an agreement on trade, adding that he expects to have a deal with India soon. But Beijing and the White House later referred to the development as an agreement on the framework for a deal.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg TV the deal was signed earlier this week. Neither Lutnick nor Mr. Trump provided any details about the accord.",
      "\"We just signed with China the other day,\" the president said.",
      "Lutnick said the deal was \"signed and sealed\" two days earlier.",
      "Rare earth minerals apparently at center stage",
      "It was unclear if the latest accord was different from the one Mr. Trump announced two weeks earlier that he said would make it easier for American industries to obtain much-needed magnets and rare earth minerals. That pact cleared the way for the trade talks to continue, while the U.S. agreed to stop trying to revoke visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that the two sides had \"further confirmed the details of the framework.\" But its statement didn't explicitly mention U.S. access to rare earths, minerals essential for hi-tech products such as defense equipment, electric vehicles and hard drives. China dominates world production of those minerals.",
      "\"China will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\" the ministry said.",
      "The agreement follows initial talks in Geneva in early May that led both sides to postpone massive tariff hikes that were threatening to freeze much trade between the two countries. Later talks in London set a framework for negotiations and the deal mentioned by Mr. Trump appeared to formalize that agreement.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Thursday that the Trump administration and China had \"agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.\"",
      "That clarification came after the Trump announcement of a \"deal\" at the White House event, at which he urged Republican lawmakers to approve the mammoth tax and budget bill before Congress.",
      "China hasn't announced any new agreements, but said earlier this week that it was speeding up approvals of exports of rare earths. Beijing's limits on rare earths exports have been a key point of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing was accelerating review of export license applications for rare earths and had approved \"a certain number of compliant applications.\"",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington after China imposed permit requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Fentanyl another key in the trade talks",
      "China also has taken steps recently on the fentanyl issue, announcing last week that it would designate two more substances as precursor chemicals for fentanyl, making them subject to production, transport and export regulations. Mr. Trump has demanded that Beijing do more to stop the flow of such precursor ingredients to Mexican drug cartels, which use them to make fentanyl for sale in the U.S. He imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports over the fentanyl issue, the biggest part of current 30% across-the-board taxes on Chinese goods.",
      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Mr. Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",
      "U.S., China economies both feeling trade disputes' effects",
      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Mr. Trump could impose tariffs on them.",
      "In China, factory profits sank more than 9% from a year earlier in May, with automakers suffering a large share of that drop. They fell more than 1% year-on-year in January-May.",
      "Mr. Trump and other U.S. officials have indicated they expect to reach trade deals with many other countries, including India.",

    "summary": "Wall Street experts break down what's behind the market rebound as S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq approach record highs.",
    "story": [
      "The S&P 500 is approaching a record high, marking a stunning turnaround from April when stocks nosedived after President Donald Trump unveiled a flurry of tariffs on so-called \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The S&P 500 has jumped 23% since closing at its 2025 low on April 8. On Thursday, it closed up 9 points, or 0.8%, to 6,141, just three points shy of its record closing high of 6,144 on February 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also flirted with its previous record of 20,174, set in December 2024, inching up 195 points, or 1%, on Thursday to close at 20,167.",
      "The market could surpass those previous records on Friday or early next week, analysts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Wall Street has largely shrugged off concerns about tariffs and geopolitical tensions since early April, although there have been periods of volatility along the way. While these issues continue to pose risks to the U.S. economy, many investors are confident they'll skirt any major market downturns, at least in the short-term, experts say.",
      "\"We hear all those narratives of what could go wrong, or what is going wrong,\" said Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro. \"But the market doesn't seem to care. It's looking forward. It's plowing ahead, and it's been trading really well.\"",
      "Still, Wall Street is awaiting more news on Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs slated to end on July 9. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that tariffs are likely to drive up inflation later this year, slowing economic growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why experts say the market is rebounding.",
      "Easing concerns about tariffs",
      "Since April, the markets have whipsawed in response to the Trump administration's on-again, off-again tariff policies.",
      "While uncertainty around the impact of the levies remains, analysts say investor concern has faded as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase after the Trump administration\u00a0struck a deal with China earlier this month.",
      "\"We've gone into a period where we haven't had a lot of disruptive noise coming either out of Washington or among our trading partners,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"I think that's helped to sort of cool anxieties, at least for the time being.\"",
      "The next benchmark will be July 9, when the president's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs comes to an end. If the U.S. slips back into a more intense trade situation, the markets could show more volatility, Kenwell said.",
      "So far, data suggests a resilient economy, although some Wall Street economists have warned the economy may soon face headwinds.",
      "A\u00a0report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute released Thursday predicts that the brunt of the tariffs impact will hit in the third quarter. The analysis also warns the tariffs could leave the U.S. with \"historically high and potentially debilitating levies.\"",
      "Optimism about tech stocks",
      "Technology stocks, dominated by the so-called \"magnificent 7\" \u2014 consisting of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and other tech giants\u2014 have been integral in driving the market rebound, analysts say.",
      "Tech has become the best performing sector so far in the second quarter, a period which spans April through June. Financial companies such as banks and insurance firms have also been performing well, he added. According to Kenwell, those two sectors alone represent over 40% of the S&P 500.",
      "Chip company Nvidia closed at a record high on Thursday, allowing the company to retake its crown as the world's most valuable company. The tech giant's stock has soared almost 62% since the market's 2025 bottom on April 8.",
      "AI-powered companies have gained momentum in recent weeks, with Micron Technology, which sells computer memory and data storage, beating earnings expectations for the latest quarter, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli pointed out.",
      "Investors have gravitated towards tech stocks, Luschini said, given their high free cash flow and potential for strong earnings growth.",
      "\"I think investors are looking at them as sort of a bastion of safety,\" he said.",
      "Signs of a potential rate cut",
      "Investors have been buoyed by forecasts for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.",
      "At the Fed's June meeting, the central bank said it would\u00a0hold rates steady but pencilled in two cuts for the remainder of the year. A rate cut could come as soon as the next meeting, July 29-30, but it's more likely it will happen during the September meeting, experts say.",
      "\"I think investors are kind of looking through the next several months to a period in which we're likely to see more accommodative monetary policy,\" said Luschini.",

    "story": [
      "Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.",
      "Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. \"It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,\" she said.",
      "In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn't worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.",
      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the decline in that figure \"troubling,\u2033 though he doesn't expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",

    "summary": "Older, wealthier Americans would see the biggest lifetime benefit from the Republican budget bill, while younger generations could see losses, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican\u00a0budget package\u00a0aims to make President Donald Trump's tax cuts permanent while offering a host of new financial breaks. Yet the \"big, beautiful bill,\" as the legislation is dubbed, could also effectively transfer wealth from younger generations to older Americans over their lifetimes, a recent study finds.",
      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

    "summary": "Nestle says it will eliminate artificial colors from its U.S. food and beverages by the middle of 2026. It's the latest big food company making that pledge.",
    "story": [
      "Nestle announced on Wednesday that it will eliminate artificial colors from its U.S. food and beverages by mid-2026.",
      "It's the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \"not recommended for human consumption\" in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Trump took office, U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of its potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday that it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn't contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it wants to evolve with its U.S. customers' changing nutritional needs and preferences. \"We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers. As their diverse dietary preferences and nutritional needs evolve, we evolve with them,\" Nestle's U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement.",
      "\"Serving and delighting people is at the heart of everything we do and every decision that we make,\" he added.",

      "The settlement was first\u00a0announced in December 2022. At the time, it marked the FTC's largest ever refund in a gaming industry case. The agency said at the time that Epic deceived consumers into making in-game purchases they would otherwise not have made.",
      "On Wednesday, the FTC said it will send nearly 970,000 checks and PayPal payments on June 25 and June 26 to consumers who filed a valid refund claim. It issued a first round of payments totaling more than $22 million in December, the agency said.",
      "The FTC reached a separate agreement last year under which Epic was fined $275 million over allegations it violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule.",
      "How can I apply for a refund?",
      "Fortnite players can visit a dedicated website to determine if they are eligible for compensation. Previously, consumers had until February 14 to file a claim, but the FTC has now extended that deadline to July 9. If you already filed a claim after February 14, no further action is required.",
      "Consumers who receive checks are instructed to cash them within 90 days. PayPal refunds should be accepted within 30 days, according to the FTC.",
      "A claim number or Epic Account ID is required to apply for a refund. A parent or guardian must apply on behalf of people under 18.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 23:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Congress is racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the tax and spending bill to the president.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted to advance President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" late Saturday night, in a key test for the tax and spending measure ahead of a final vote expected in the coming days.",
      "In a 51 to 49 vote, all but two Republicans voted to advance the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, following hours of delay as the GOP appeared to iron out last-minute details and support. The vote stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders before supporting moving forward on the measure.",
      "Vice President JD Vance came to Capitol Hill Saturday night in case he would need to cast a tie-breaking vote, which he ultimately did not.",
      "Sens. Thom Tillis and Rand Paul were the only two Republicans to vote against the measure. In a Truth Social post Saturday night as the roll call vote dragged on, Mr. Trump indicated he would work to support primary challenges to Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "\"Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against 'Senator Thom' Tillis,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America.\"",
      "The vote came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday he wasn't certain he had the votes to advance the bill, as the upper chamber awaited decisions on whether a number of provisions complied with the Senate's reconciliation rules, which allow Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority. Major policy disputes also remained.",
      "Senate Republicans did not release an updated version of their bill until late Friday night, giving senators little time to digest it before taking an initial procedural vote that's necessary to move toward final passage.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressured Congress to send him the sprawling package \u2014 which includes tax cuts and funding for his immigration and defense priorities \u2014 by the Fourth of July holiday.",
      "In a statement, obtained by CBS News on Saturday, the White House said that a failure to pass the bill would be the \"ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reflects the shared priorities of both the Congress and the Administration. Therefore, the Congress should immediately pass this bill and send it to the President's desk by July 4, 2025, to show the American people that they are serious about 'promises made, promises kept,'\" the statement said. \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "In the bill, Republicans proposed slashing funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income individuals and people with disabilities, and food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 or food stamps \u2014 to help pay for those priorities.",
      "Over the last week, the Senate parliamentarian determined that some of the most controversial provisions in the package violated a rule that governs the reconciliation process, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending. The rulings directed Republicans to either drop those sections from the package or rewrite them.",
      "Meanwhile, in the leadup to the vote, disputes over Medicaid spending cuts, the state and local tax deduction and a planned debt ceiling increase still lingered among Republicans.",
      "In a promising sign for Senate leadership hours ahead of the vote, two Republican senators who expressed opposition to provisions in the bill said they would vote to advance it.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she would not vote against the measure advancing, but noted that did not indicate her vote on final passage.",
      "\"If the bill is not further changed, I would be leaning against the bill,\" Collins said Saturday afternoon.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has criticized the bill's Medicaid cuts, said he will be a \"yes\" vote on final passage because his state will be receiving more funding for the program.",
      "\"With the delay in the provider tax framework that we were able to get and with the changes to the rural hospital fund, Missouri's Medicaid dollars will actually increase over the next four years. So we will get more money \u2014 Medicaid funding \u2014 over baseline until 2030. Any changes to our provider framework in Missouri will not take place until the next decade,\" Hawley said Saturday.",
      "\"I want to be clear, I'm going to spend the next however long trying to make sure that the cuts that we have successfully delayed never take place,\" Hawley said. \"I think that this effort to cut Medicaid funding is a mistake. We've been able for Missouri to delay it. As I said, we're actually going to get more money in the next four years. But that's not true of all the states.\"",
      "However, as a possible vote drew closer Saturday, a handful of Senate Republicans remained publicly opposed. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he would vote against advancing the bill and would be a \"no\" on final passage. And Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin had been vocal about their opposition in recent weeks, citing concern about its impact on the national deficit.",
      "Paul was among a handful of Republican senators who golfed with the president Saturday, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. Asked whether Paul could be convinced to support the bill, Graham said, \"There's some things we might be able to do if we need to, but I don't think he'll vote for final passage.\"",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate Republicans could only afford to lose three votes with all Democrats voting against the legislation.",
      "House Republicans narrowly passed a version of the bill in May. and the lower chamber is expected to be called back to Washington to vote on the Senate version if it survives the upper chamber in the coming days. But House Republicans have warned that any major changes made by the Senate put its ability to make it through the House again at risk.",
      "Thune said on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon that \"53 members will never agree on every detail of legislation.\" But he urged that Republicans are \"united in our commitment to what we're doing in this bill.\"",
      "\"It's time to get this legislation across the finish line,\" Thune added.",
      "But Democrats, without the ability to block the bill from passing, pledged to drag out the process. According to a source, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told Senate Democrats to prepare for a full reading of the legislation on the floor, which would delay a vote on final passage by hours.",
      "The minority leader announced the move immediately following Saturday's vote.",
      "\"Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don't realize what's in it,\" Schumer said. \"If Senate Republicans won't tell the American people what's in this bill, then Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish.\"",

      "Hundreds gathered Saturday morning at Minneapolis' Basilica of St. Mary for the private funeral of Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark and their dog, Gilbert.",
      "Gov. Tim Walz and Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of the Hortmans, spoke at the service, which was a traditional Catholic Mass said by Father Dan Griffith. Walz also served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history \u2013 and I'll always remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I've ever known,\" Walz said in his eulogy. \"For seven years, I've had the privilege of signing her bills into law. And I know that millions of Minnesotans will get to live better lives because she and Mark chose public service.\"",
      "Melissa Hortman was remembered for her leadership, sense of humor and strong commitment to doing good work to improve the lives of Minnesotans.",
      "\"Her mission was to get as much good done for as many people as possible,\" Walz said. \"That focus on people is what made Melissa so effective. She knew how to get her way, no doubt about it. But she never made anyone feel like they'd gotten rolled at the negotiating table.\"",
      "Mark Hortman shared his wife's passion for helping others, Walz said, the two having met at a mentorship event in Washington, D.C., more than 30 years ago.",
      "\"...There's a part of the story that belongs only to those of us fortunate enough to know the people behind that legacy,\" Walz said. \"It takes place at CR's Billiards, where Mark loved to shoot pool on Monday nights. It takes place in the garden, where Melissa fussed over her lilies like they were wayward members of the caucus. It takes place in the kitchen, where Mark fed his sourdough starter and Melissa mixed margaritas and baked cakes and Gilbert begged for scraps and the sound of laughter filled the air.\"",
      "The governor encouraged people to learn from the way the Hortmans lived to honor their legacy.",
      "\"Maybe this is a moment when each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for the things we care about. A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did \u2013 fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity,\" Walz said. \"But let's not do it because of the way Mark and Melissa died. Let's do it because of the way they lived, and the way they led. With joy and passion. With respect and empathy. With purpose and humility.\"",
      "Griffith said the Hortmans would regularly open their Brooklyn Park home to guests, adding they referred to it as the \"Hortman Hotel.\"",
      "\"Everyone was welcome,\" Griffith said. \"I can't believe how Melissa and Mark lived community with that degree of intentionality. It's a beautiful thing.\"",
      "In her eulogy, Williams added that the evenings Mark and Melissa Hortman spent with their friends \"held a sacrosanct position\" on their calendars.",
      "\"We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again. And Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way,\" she said.",
      "Colin Hortman, the son of Mark of Melissa, gave the prayer alongside his fianc\u00e9e. He recited the Prayer of St. Francis, a copy of which he says Melissa Hortman kept in her wallet.",
      "Among attendees were former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who were invited to the funeral by Walz on behalf of the Hortmans' children.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar was unable to attend the Hortmans' funeral in person, but praised their leadership.",
      "\"They met as volunteers working to help kids, and that dedication to serving others never wavered,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.. \"Sophie and Colin said that the best way to honor their parents is 'to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.' I can think of no better way to honor Melissa and Mark.\"",
      "In the days following their deaths, the Hortman children, in a statement remembering their parents, encouraged people to honor their memory with a list of actions, including baking, petting a dog and planting a tree.",
      "Hortmans lie in state",
      "The funeral comes one day after the Hortmans and their dog laid in state in the Minnesota Capitol Rotunda. Melissa Hortman is the first woman to ever have the honor.",
      "Walz was among the first mourners to visit the rotunda on Friday. Later Friday afternoon, former President Joe Biden arrived at the State Capitol rotunda to pay tribute.",
      "People began arriving before 10 a.m. Friday, standing on the Capitol steps to make sure they were in place for their chance to pay tribute to the lawmaker many say perfected the art of compromise \u2014 working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what she thought was best for all Minnesotans.",
      "\"It's an honor to be here,\" said Julie Johnson, of Rochester. \"Melissa was just such a giving, selfless servant for everybody.\"",
      "Some came with flowers. Others wore their hearts on their sleeves, devastated by the loss of the people's lawmaker who worked for decades to make the lives of all Minnesotans better.",
      "Minnesota Department of Public Safety Assistant Commissioner John Cunningham said 7,500 people paid respects at the Capitol rotunda on Friday.",
      "Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota House for 11 terms, representing District 34B, after being elected to the legislature in 2004. She also spent several years in the role of House Speaker.",
      "Melissa Hortman and her husband leave behind two children.",
      "Since her killing, many have been praising her leadership. On Thursday, U.S. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Delano, honored her on the House floor as a bridge builder.",
      "\"As speaker of the Minnesota House, she led with integrity and fostered bipartisan collaboration, even during the most challenging times in our state,\" Emmer said.",
      "Until Melissa Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "\"Melissa Hortman represented the best of Minnesota,\" DFL party chair Richard Carlbom said in a statement. \"She was a tireless, devoted public servant who deeply loved our state and devoted her life to making it a better place. The warmth and kindness she showed to her family and friends were matched only by her fierce commitment to improving the lives of those she had never even met.\"",
      "The Hortmans' suspected killer",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, is accused of killing the Hortmans and their dog inside their Brooklyn Park home in the early morning hours of June 14. He was arrested near his Sibley County home some 36 hours after the shootings. Officials say it was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history.",
      "About 90 minutes before the Hortmans were killed, Boelter is accused of going to the Champlin home of\u00a0Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and shooting him nine times.\u00a0His wife, Yvette, was shot eight times. The Hoffmans are still recovering. The former President also paid a visit to the Hoffmans on Friday.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 22:05:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also posted that the bill would be \"political suicide for the Republican Party.\"",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday doubled down on his distaste for President Trump's sprawling tax and spending cuts bill, arguing the legislation that Republican senators are scrambling to pass would kill jobs and bog down burgeoning industries.",
      "\"The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,\" Musk wrote on X on Saturday as the Senate was scheduled to call a vote to open debate on the nearly 1,000-page bill. \"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\"",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, whose birthday is also Saturday, later posted that the bill would be \"political suicide for the Republican Party.\"",
      "The criticisms reopen a recent fiery conflict between the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency and the administration he recently left. They also represent yet another headache for Republican Senate leaders who have spent the weekend working overtime to get the legislation through their chamber so it can pass by Mr. Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Musk has previously made his opinions about Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" clear. In late May, just a few days before he officially left his post in the federal government, he told \"CBS Sunday morning\" he was \"disappointed\" with the bill's price tag.",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS News.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk added. \"But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "Following a laudatory celebration in the Oval Office, his language became more aggressive and he blasted the bill as \"pork-filled\" and a \"disgusting abomination.\"",
      "\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he wrote on X earlier this month. In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who had recently forecasted that he'd step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who \"betrayed the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Mr. Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The president also threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies. SpaceX receives tens of billions of dollars in federal money, most of which are in the form of federal grants from NASA.",
      "\"He's got a lot of money, he gets a lot of subsidy,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on June 6. \"So we'll take a look at that. Only if it's fair for him and for the country. I would certainly think about it, but it has to be fair.\"",
      "Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that \"went too far.\" Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, \"Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.\"",
      "The shocking rift came after Musk donated $277 million to Trump's presidential campaign and other Republican candidates in the last election cycle, according to campaign finance records.",
      "It's unclear how Musk's latest broadsides will influence the fragile peace he and the president had enjoyed in recent weeks. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Musk has spent recent weeks focused on his businesses, and his political influence has waned since he left the administration.",

    "summary": "Republicans released an updated version of the legislation late Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans released the latest version of President Trump's massive spending and tax bill late Friday as the GOP eyes an ambitious July 4 deadline to approve the centerpiece legislation of the president's second-term agenda.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate Republicans have been putting their imprint on the bill. But GOP leaders are seeking a middle ground to appease the upper chamber without alienating House Republicans, who will have to approve the Senate's changes before the bill can head to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "At the center of the bill is an extension to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, slated to sunset at year's end, seeking to make the cuts permanent in what has been a key priority for Senate Republicans. It also includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.",
      "But along with different dynamics in the Senate, Republicans have also been contending with input from the Senate's rulekeeper, known as the parliamentarian. She has been weighing in on the bill's components to determine whether they may fly under the reconciliation process, which allows the GOP to move forward with the bill without any support from across the aisle.",
      "Here's what's in the Senate's updated version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" some of which remains in flux:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in the Senate in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $25 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "However, Alaska and Hawaii would receive temporary exemptions from the cost-sharing requirement. Both states would receive a two-year reprieve if the Department of Agriculture determines they are \"actively implementing a corrective action plan.\"",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18-64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could also receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill, as Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, outlining that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime. But the provisions would expire in 2028. The Senate bill would reduce the deductions for individuals making over $150,000, while the House bill does not include income limits.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",
      "Asylum fee",
      "The legislation also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and other fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "AI moratorium",
      "A revised proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence also made it into the Senate bill. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",
      "Public lands",
      "The Senate version would order the sale of up to 0.5% of public lands in 11 states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. Eligible lands would have to be located within 5 miles of a population center and the sale of federally protected lands is prohibited.",
      "Supporters of the provision say it would address the housing availability and affordability crisis.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025. The interview was taped on June 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, welcome to the program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Thank you very much, Margaret. Good to talk to you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director General, there is so much happening. I'm hoping you can walk us through what you know. Iran's foreign minister has said that the damage to their nuclear facilities from the U.S. bombing is significant and serious. We know Israel has also killed a number of top Iranian nuclear scientists. What exactly is Iran's capability at this moment?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, yes, and I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but you will see that there is an agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage. It can be, you know, described in different ways, but it's clear that what happened in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has, to some degree, capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those- of those capabilities. This is- this is clear. And now the important issue- the important thing is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very important, the material that they will be producing if they continue with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is connected. This is- this is contingent on negotiations which may or may not restart, so- so what we see this here, I think we have a snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned there diplomacy. President Trump has been calling for diplomatic talks with Iran to settle all the issues around the nuclear program. I know you were in regular contact with envoy Steve Witkoff. Are you talking to him now? Will the IAEA be involved in any agreement?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, at some point we will have to be, because if his efforts, which I support wholeheartedly, succeed, this will come to a point where there is some agreement, some understanding on things that Iran will continue doing, and some things where there could be an agreement on certain restrictions. And of course, who is going to verify that is the IAEA so this is why we're in constant contact. Now they need to reconnect. And it's not going to be easy, one can imagine, after the traumatic events that took place. Even for us, you may have seen that I wrote to Foreign Minister Araghchi a few days ago, immediately, I would say, after the cease-fire was considered to be holding, and I said to him that we should perhaps sit down and analyze in a gradual way the reconnection, the modalities for the inspectors to go- to go back. So there is a level where the IAEA is not involved, and this is the direct conversation. What is the deal? And then, of course, we will be connecting to make sure that that deal stands and it's verifiable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, Tehran just passed a law saying they want to suspend cooperation with the IAEA inspectors. The foreign minister said he had no plans to let you personally, Mr. Director General, into the country. Does that mean Iran will completely block all inspectors? Do those you already have in the country have any access?",
      "GROSSI: Well, certainly I hope this is not the case. I think that what the foreign minister said is that they were looking into this law and how this law would impact our activities. I think it's time- this is why it's so important that we sit down around the table and we look into this. Iran- and I think nobody has put that in question, and I hope nobody will, is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, like more than 190 countries in the world. So- so, that implies that they have to work with the- with the agency. So we have to go- we have been going through this law that they have, that the Majles approved, and we see that they are talking about cooperation on the basis of- of the security and the safety of their sites. I think that is not incompatible with the inspection work that needs to take place. But of course, it's not Rafael Grossi and Margaret Brennan discussing this that we are going to solve it. I think we- I have to sit down with- with- with Iran and look into this, because at the end of the day, this whole thing, after the military strikes, will have to have a long lasting solution, which cannot be but a diplomatic one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're not kicking- they're not kicking out your inspectors at this point?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Not in this sense. I would not say that I am looking with interest and with some concern what they have approved. But of course, it's their law. It is their parliament. But you know, here there are legal implications. An international treaty, of course, takes precedence. You cannot invoke an internal law not to abide with an international treaty. But Iran is not saying that at the moment, and I think this is constructive. So this is why I think we have to go down into the details, because the work will have to continue, otherwise nobody will have an idea of what is happening in Iran. Iran will continue with a nuclear program, the contours of which are still to be seen and will be I am sure, part of these negotiations, which I hope, will be resuming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran officially reported weeks ago that they were going to take measures in advance of these strikes to try to protect their nuclear assets. Did they share with the IAEA what those plans were? Where they were going to stash things like centrifuges, the machines that help enrich fuel? Where they were going to put the gas canisters that have enriched uranium?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: No, no, they did not inform that- that to us, but at the same time, there was no physical time, perhaps, to do it. Iran, for example, had announced to us that they had a new enrichment facility in Isfahan, and we were going to go on the 13th of June to- to check on that facility so that- and the site has been severely damaged and hit. So this is why I say it is indispensable. We will have to, aggravation or not, feelings and emotions or not, there has to come a point with- with cool heads. We sit around the table and- and see what- I mean, these protective measures, of course, it's their right to protect their assets, like any other sovereign nation. They can, of course, protect- but they know and there are, I don't want to get too technical or legalese here in this conversation, but there are provisions in the agreements we have, not only with Iran, with any- with any country. If a country at a- at a moment, feels that some of the things we inspect must be protected or whatever, they have to tell us, and we have to go, etc., etc., as you can imagine. So, this could not happen because of the unfolding of the circumstances, of a military conflict where, of course, you know, decisions are taken and this is not planned or announced, obviously. So now- now it's the time to reconnect and to talk and to talk to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, but there was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium, before the attacks. I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved, and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's- it's logical to presume that when they announce that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But, as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved. So there has to be at some point a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as- as a potential problem. So this is why I say it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask you about what things might still remain, because there's that open question of could Iran sprint towards a bomb even now, if they wanted to. If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is that still a risk that they could be rushing towards a bomb?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, you know, I- we don't want to be alarmists here, and I don't want to be part of, you know, a messaging that would be spreading, as I say, alarm. But we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened. Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there. The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily. You are going to have an agreement. You are going to have an inspection system that will give everybody, everybody in the region and- and- and elsewhere, the assurances that we can- we can definitely turn the page.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until right before the strikes, the IAEA still had inspectors, as I understand it, going to some of these sites. There's been a lot of focus here in America on the trucks and satellite images of them outside of Fordo. What was happening in those days before the strike?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, as- as you were pointing out there were- there was an announcement of protective measures that could have included moving equipment and material. We don't know. We saw the same images that the whole world has seen of these trucks, and we don't want to get into any rush conclusion about it, but it is, it is clear that we need the things that we ignore, okay. And after a reasonable period, after the war, there has to be a process that needs to continue. Otherwise the uncertainties will continue, will continue to linger on. And this is, you know, in a final analysis, not good, and perhaps even preventing a good agreement, because who is going to have an agreement where you don't know what the counterpart really has? What are the assets that they really have after the- after this- this- this military campaign that took place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until these strikes Iran- Iran was still disclosing information to the IAEA--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --Well yes, yes, yes, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-In certain amounts--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: There were deficits. There were deficits, and we were referring to those in the- in the sense that there were some things that they were not clarifying to us. But our inspection work was- was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was- it was complete. It was comprehensive. And, of course, at the moment, there is- there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. The world was concerned--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You said you were concerned about it. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested they were looking to weaponize?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They- let me be clear here, because we said, first of all, something very, very important. They have all these capabilities, but for the agency, they- first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons. Okay? This needs to be said. One can have an assessment nationally that they were close, okay? And I don't get into that, because we, the IAEA, does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So it is countries that- that say, well, this is of concern or not. What we were concerning- what- what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we had found traces of uranium in some places in Iran, which were not the normal declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place x, y or z? And we were simply not getting credible answers. If there was material- where is this material? So there could be even more. We don't know. This is why it is, I'm sorry I'm repeating it for the third time, I think we need to go back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, understood. But your statement and that report that you gave about some of these open questions or unanswered questions, the Iranians are pointing to it now, and the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. He said it wasn't honest and fair, your report. He said, after the facilities, you didn't even condemn the strikes- after the strikes, I should say. What do you make of those criticisms?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well- I, to an extent, I understand. They have been under attack. But, really, who can believe that this conflict happened because of a report of the IAEA? And, by the way, what was- what was in that report was not new, Margaret. We have been saying that for a long time, and in previous reports as well. So, this- maybe it's because it's easier, maybe, to criticize an international organization or a director general, I don't know, but it's not reasonable to say that. And, if anything, the IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that- that were saying in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. And we didn't. We simply didn't, because this was not what we were seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Absolutely, because we have to see everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They did- we didn't see them. We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending. So this is- this is the truth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I appreciate the nuance here, because there's so much gray. People here are looking for clarity, and there's confusion in the United States. CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back a few months, but once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the National Intelligence directors say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years. What's the truth here? What do you make of these assessments?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: You know- you know what, this hourglass approach in weapons of mass destruction is- is not a good idea. Remember, we had cases 45 minutes and so on, which were quite- quite off spot. All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. If you tell me it will take them two months or three months, for what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.",
      "Because, first of all, as I- and I think the intelligence- we are not there making any military evaluations, first of all, but, out of the logic of our conversation, it is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all. And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again. This is again- and I'm sorry, fourth time, we have to go back to the table and have a technically sound solution to this. Otherwise, this will come hit us again, in terms of a situation which is not well clarified. And this is an opportunity. We do have an opportunity now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, and we will see if that opportunity is picked up by either side. Director General, thank you for your time today.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Thank you, as always, a pleasure. Thank you very much.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 08:00:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Now in its sixth month, President Trump's administration has become the antithesis of progress, many LGBTQ Americans say.",
    "story": [
      "In Marsha P. Johnson's final interview before her death in 1992, the activist later recognized as an icon of the movement that preceded LGBTQ rights in the United States explained why she, a transgender woman, championed a cause that often excluded her.",
      "\"I've been walking for gay rights all these years,\" Johnson said, referencing early Pride marches in a conversation that appears in a 2012 documentary about her life. \"Because you never completely have your rights, one person, until you all have your rights.\"",
      "Since then, social and political wins over time grew to encompass everyone represented by the acronym LGBTQ, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. But that's become less true in recent years, as lawmakers in Tennessee, Texas and a number of other states repeatedly pushed legislation to restrict access to gender-affirming care, bathrooms and sports teams for transgender people.",
      "Anti-trans sentiment was central to President Trump's 2024 campaign, LGBTQ advocates say, and it followed him into office. Many of his directives this term have closely mirrored Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda that explicitly prioritizes eroding LGBTQ rights.",
      "A \"divide and conquer\" approach",
      "From health care bans, to sports bans, bathroom bans, a military ban and attempts to erase non-binary gender pronouns from the federal system, Mr. Trump's most conspicuous threats to LGBTQ rights specifically target trans people, a pattern that has drawn accusations of scapegoating from his critics, given that trans people make up an estimated 1% or less of the U.S. population.",
      "LGBTQ advocates also see it as a tactic to sow division in the community.",
      "\"Donald Trump ran for president on an age-old platform of divide and conquer,\" said Brandon Wolf, the national press secretary at the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. \"Inside the LGBTQ+ community, Donald Trump ran his campaign saying, I'm not targeting all LGBTQ+ people, just the trans people, and if you sacrifice that community, perhaps you will be spared.\"",
      "While polling data showed most LGBTQ voters didn't choose to elect him, Mr. Trump has gained increasingly loud support from a faction of gay conservatives who disavow the \"radical LGBT left\" and insist his policies aren't at odds with their personal freedoms.",
      "When the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced the upcoming termination of part of its 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to helping LGBTQ youth, the gay conservative group Log Cabin Republicans called related media coverage \"fake news.\"",
      "On TikTok, a small but popular band of conservative gay influencers post videos to similarly defend Mr. Trump's record. \"Rights I've lost in Trump's America as a gay man,\" reads the caption of one of them, followed by an empty list numbered 1 through 5. In the comments section of another, a TikTok user responded to a thread outlining the current administration's anti-LGBTQ actions by saying, \"None of that has anything to do with us being gay.\"",
      "Trump's orders",
      "On Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump declared in his televised address to the American public that \"only two genders,\" male and female, would be recognized going forward by the federal government. He signed an executive order to enforce that within hours of being sworn in.",
      "Titled \"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" the wide-ranging order included instructions for the State Department to prohibit trans people from using gender markers that reflect their identities on official documents, like passports, and instead require that those markers align with the document holders' reproductive organs \"at conception.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration's passport policy attacks the foundations of the right to privacy and the freedom for all people to live their lives safely and with dignity,\" said Jessie Rossman, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts, which has made headway in a lawsuit aiming to reverse the new rule, in a statement. \"We will continue to fight to stop this unlawful policy once and for all.\"",
      "Like many of Mr. Trump's executive orders, that one has faced steep challenges in the courts, and legal experts say its long-term applicability is uncertain as some elements contradict the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which codified discrimination protections for all LGBTQ employees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The same conflict exists in Mr. Trump's orders to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, in which he instructed federal departments to \"correct\" what he called a \"misapplication\" of the Bostock ruling in their policies.",
      "Their uncertain futures aside, LGBTQ advocacy and rights groups feel those policies and others have already reaped consequences on the community at large \u2014 \"the predictable result,\" said Wolf, \"of a divide and conquer campaign.\"",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive to end \"radical indoctrination in K-12 schools,\" the Department of Defense banned books with themes involving gender identity, sexual orientation and race from its schools for children in military families, which receive federal funding, according to a separate lawsuit filed by the ACLU. A textbook focused on LGBTQ figures in American history was tossed out under the ban.",
      "Meanwhile, corporations scrambling to comply with anti-DEI orders eliminated or scaled back their partnerships with Pride celebrations around the country after Mr. Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center in February forced WorldPride organizers to regroup because events were either canceled or relocated from the venue. And, in May, the Human Rights Campaign issued a memo warning that Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" a \"skinny\" budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year, would cut $2.67 billion in federal funding from programs that support LGBTQ people.",
      "Among its most urgent concerns were the administration's plans to significantly downsize public health programs for HIV/AIDS prevention as well as Justice Department programs that investigate anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, in addition to sweeping cuts to resources for the trans community.",
      "Asked where LGBTQ rights stand under the Trump administration, a White House spokesperson pointed to Mr. Trump's past appointments of openly gay judges and officials such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in addition to two initiatives during his first term to decriminalize homosexuality globally and end the HIV epidemic by 2030, although his 2026 budget proposal would hamper that.",
      "\"President Trump's historic reelection and the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people,\" said the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, in a statement. \"The President continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans. The American people voted for a return to common sense, and the President is delivering on every campaign promise supported by 77 million voters and is ushering in our Golden Age.\"",
      "\"An anti-LGBTQ administration\"",
      "In addition to tangible policies, advocates say that attitudes toward LGBTQ people from the nation's highest office are contributing to higher incidences of violence against LGBTQ people and likely foreshadow harms still to come.",
      "\"Overall, it is clearly an anti-LGBTQ administration,\" said Sarah-Kate Ellis, the president and chief operating officer at the LGBTQ media organization GLAAD. \"And I think that they are consistently signaling that they want to roll back all of our hard-won rights.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and those in his orbit have repeatedly cast LGBTQ people and activities in a negative light. While announcing leadership shifts at the Kennedy Center in February, the president penned a social media post that pledged, in capital letters, to ensure the arts forum would no longer host drag shows \"or other anti-American propaganda.\" His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, later said the country needs \"less LGBTQ graduate majors\" in an interview on Fox News criticizing Harvard University.",
      "According to advocates and academics, the administration frequently relies on political strategies to marginalize trans people that have been used against other groups in the past. The term \"groomers,\" for example, is a historically anti-gay trope, and \"gender ideology\" originally demonized feminism.",
      "There were also notable moments of silence from the Trump administration, which did not acknowledge Pride Month, even as a global Pride festival took place for several weeks between May and June in Washington, D.C. LGBTQ people say that wasn't necessarily a surprise after watching their visibility decline in national forums this year, starting with mentions of \"lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" \"gay,\" \"transgender,\" \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" being scrubbed from the White House website the day after Mr. Trump's inauguration, in a flashback to his first term.",
      "References to trans people disappeared around the same time from the website for the Stonewall National Monument, considered the birthplace of gay liberation, in a move that sparked particular outcry. Marcia P. Johnson was among the pioneering trans activists who remain named on the site despite that change.",
      "Where do LGBTQ rights stand in America?",
      "Advocates for LGBTQ rights and others in the community say they're wary of what may come next. Echoing discourse that has persisted online since Mr. Trump's campaign, Ellis said she expects a right-wing push to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, is imminent.",
      "\"Our view on this is that they will continually attack our community and find any way to dismantle our community,\" she said, of the right-wing forces propelling Mr. Trump. \"They've only focused on trans people because they are such a small population and so marginalized. But they will go after our marriages. They will go after our families. It has always been the anti-LGBTQ movement at the center of this.\"",
      "At least nine state legislatures have introduced bills to reverse the Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling since Mr. Trump returned to Washington. Earlier this month, the Southern Baptist Convention voted overwhelmingly to pass a resolution that calls for the same. LGBTQ advocates emphasize that marriage equality is settled law, and research from Gallup and GLAAD demonstrate that a vast majority of Americans continue to support it. But some still worry the path to overturning Obergefell could be akin to the one that led to the fall of Roe v. Wade, which kept abortion legal for 50 years before Trump-appointed justices tipped the Supreme Court bench and struck it down.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine forced a vote on a resolution he introduced days before the U.S. bombed Iran.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Friday voted down an effort to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran, as Democratic anger festers over the lack of details about the\u00a0recent strikes\u00a0on the country's nuclear facilities.",
      "The measure failed in a 47-53 vote, with Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voting with most Democrats in favor of the resolution, and Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voting with most Republicans against it.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia introduced the war powers resolution days before the U.S. bombed three locations central to Iran's nuclear program, seeking to force the president to get congressional authorization before entering the conflict between Israel and Iran.",
      "\"The events of this week have demonstrated that war is too big to be consigned to the decisions of any one person,\" Kaine said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Since the measure was introduced, Mr. Trump announced a ceasefire between the adversaries and declared that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated\" during the 12-day war. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he would \"without question\" consider bombing Iran again if Tehran was enriching uranium to a level that concerned the U.S.",
      "But anger from Democrats, including those who have said that Iran should never be able to obtain a nuclear weapon, has simmered as they say they have been left in the dark about U.S. military actions.",
      "It's led some Democrats to question whether the Trump administration is misleading the public about the strikes, especially after an initial classified assessment found that they set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Top intelligence officials said Wednesday that new intelligence showed the nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" and its facilities \"destroyed.\" It would take the Iranians \"years\" to rebuild the facilities, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called it \"an historically successful attack\" in a contentious press briefing Thursday.",
      "Classified briefings for the Senate and House were originally scheduled for Tuesday, the same day the initial assessment was leaked. Officials briefed senators on Thursday afternoon and House members on Friday.",
      "A White House official said Tuesday the Senate briefing was postponed because of \"evolved circumstances as a result of recent positive developments in the Middle East.\"",
      "After the briefings, some Democrats cast doubt on the administration's characterization of the strikes and questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said the information disclosed in the briefing was \"massively different than what has been told to Congress over the last year, up until a month ago, about both Iranian capabilities and Iranian intent.\"",
      "Crow said he was \"not convinced of that whatsoever\" when asked whether Iranian nuclear facilities had been obliterated.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has railed against a lack of transparency and said earlier this week the administration had not presented Congress with any evidence that Iran posed an imminent threat requiring immediate military action.",
      "But Jeffries did not go as far as supporting a resolution to impeach Mr. Trump over the bombings. He and more than 120 Democrats voted with all Republicans to kill the measure, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas, on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also questioned the timing of the strikes.",
      "\"It's pretty clear that there was no imminent threat to the United States,\" Himes said. \"There's always an Iranian threat to the world. But ... I have not seen anything to suggest that the threat from the Iranians was radically different last Saturday than it was two Saturdays ago.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution was one of a handful of similar efforts seeking to curtail further U.S. involvement in Iran, though it's unclear whether any will be successful in a Congress controlled narrowly by Republicans.",
      "Some Republicans who were initially supportive of the resolutions, like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, appear to be backing away from forcing a vote as long as the ceasefire holds and the U.S. does not conduct any further bombings. And House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, called the efforts irrelevant because Iran and Israel agreed to stop the fighting.",
      "\"It's kind of a moot point now, isn't it?\" Johnson said Monday. \"It seems rather silly at this point and I hope they'll acknowledge it as such and put it to bed because it has zero chance of passing anyway.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal this week he believes Mr. Trump acted \"perfectly within his authority\" by striking Iran.",
      "\"I don't think there's any question the president has the authority legally and constitutionally to do what he did,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"There are always questions around these things, but past presidents and both political parties have similarly acted in circumstances where there've been airstrikes at various places around the world where our national security interests dictated it.\"",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, and most major military conflicts in recent history have been launched under an authorization for the use of military force passed by Congress. But presidents have periodically acted without explicit permission from lawmakers, including during President Bill Clinton's 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia and President Barack Obama's 2011 airstrikes on Libya, the Congressional Research Service notes.",
      "In announcing his support for Kaine's resolution, Paul said Congress was abdicating its constitutional responsibility by allowing a president to act unilaterally and warned that last week's strikes could have unintended consequences.",
      "\"Despite the tactical success of our strikes, they may end up proving to be a strategic failure. It is unclear if this intervention will fully curtail Iran's nuclear aspirations, or, in fact, whether the Iranians may well conclude to double down on their efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon,\" Paul said.",
      "Those opposed to the resolution argued that Mr. Trump acted within his constitutional authority and that the measure would constrain the president's ability to respond quickly to a threat.",
      "In an interview last week with CBS News' Major Garrett, Kaine acknowledged that his resolution could fail but said he wanted his colleagues to be on the record about U.S. involvement in another war.",
      "\"Everyone in the Senate should agree that this is a matter of such gravity and importance that we shouldn't allow war to begin without Congress having a debate in full view of the American public and members of the Senate and House having to go on the record about it,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 21:12:12 -0400",
    "summary": "The court ruled that universal injunctions issued by lower courts likely exceed the authority Congress has granted them.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday limited the use of nationwide injunctions, reining in federal judges' ability to issue sweeping orders that have in recent years stymied implementation of policies from Republican and Democratic presidential administrations alike.",
      "In a widely anticipated decision stemming from President Trump's executive order seeking to end\u00a0birthright citizenship, the high court said that universal orders likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to the federal courts. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with the liberal justices in dissent.",
      "The court granted the Trump administration request to narrow the reach of the injunctions blocking the president's executive order while proceedings move forward, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief\" to plaintiffs who can sue, Barrett wrote. The justices did not address the question of whether Mr. Trump's order is constitutional, and the administration has said agencies have 30 days to issue public guidance about implementation of the policy, allowing time for more challenges to be filed.",
      "\"Some say that the universal injunction 'give[s] the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch.' But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,\" Barrett wrote. \"When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.\"",
      "In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the majority of abdicating its role in protecting the rule of law. She read portions of her dissenting opinion from the bench.",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the president has made a 'solemn mockery' of our Constitution,\" she wrote. \"Rather than stand firm, the court gives way.\"",
      "At a White House news conference following the decision, Mr. Trump praised it as \"a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Universal injunctions and the birthright citizenship case",
      "The court's ruling came in a trio of emergency appeals by the Trump administration arising out of the president's executive order seeking to end the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, which means that everyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to narrow the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's policy nationwide while legal challenges brought by 22 states, immigrants' rights groups and seven individuals moved forward.",
      "But instead of swiftly deciding whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief, the Supreme Court held arguments on whether to restrict the use of nationwide, or universal, injunctions, which are judicial orders that prevent the government from enforcing a policy anywhere in the country and against anyone, including individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship has become intertwined with the administration's battle against nationwide injunctions. These sweeping orders have frustrated both Democratic and Republican presidents seeking to implement their agendas among gridlock in Congress, and the fight over them has been simmering for several years.",
      "The Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued during Mr. Trump's first term and 28 granted while former President Joe Biden was in office. In Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service found 17 nationwide injunctions were issued during the first 100 days, though the Trump administration estimated last month there have been far more \u2014 at least 40 of these orders, and most coming from the same five judicial districts.",
      "Some of the justices have suggested in past writings that the Supreme Court would have to clarify whether nationwide injunctions are allowed at all, and members on both ideological sides of the bench have been critical of them. The president and his allies have\u00a0attacked judges\u00a0for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for\u00a0some to be impeached.",
      "The president's birthright citizenship order was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office. While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident. The president directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children in those categories born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-a-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the order. Federal appeals courts in California, Massachusetts and Virginia then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the cases. The administration said the Supreme Court should, at a minimum, allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance while proceedings continue, and took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts. Government lawyers said in a filing that universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "But the plaintiffs in the cases urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders in place. In a filing\u00a0of their own, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" since it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.\"",
      "The states argued that the Trump administration seeks to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "The court's decision",
      "Writing for the majority, Barrett looked to the nation's history and said that nationwide injunctions were \"conspicuously nonexistent\" in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. If federal courts had such a tool, she said, \"surely they would not have let it lay idle.\"",
      "\"Nothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a century thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal courts lack authority to issue them,\" she wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor warned that the Supreme Court's new regime puts all manner of constitutional rights at risk and renders them \"meaningful in name only\" for people who are not parties to a lawsuit.",
      "\"Today, the threat is birthright citizenship,\" she wrote. \"Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the court's conservative majority of ignoring whether Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship is constitutional and said its \"patent unlawfulness\" underscores why universal injunctions are appropriate remedies.",
      "While the high court agreed to grant Mr. Trump's request for a partial stay of the injunctions, Barrett wrote that there are still issues for the lower courts to decide, including whether narrower relief is appropriate.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision still allows plaintiffs challenging a policy to file class-action lawsuits and seek certification of a nationwide class. In her dissent, Sotomayor urged individuals who may be impacted by Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship plan, as well as lower courts, to move swiftly.",
      "\"[T]he parents of children covered by the Citizenship Order would be well advised to file promptly class-action suits and to request temporary injunctive relief for the putative class pending class certification,\" she wrote. \"For suits challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order, moreover, lower courts would be wise to act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court's prompt review.\"",
      "On the heels of the Supreme Court's decision, CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, asked the federal district court to allow its lawsuit to proceed on a classwide basis and certify as a class \"all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration will revoke the legal status and work permits of hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants in early September, arguing that conditions in Haiti have sufficiently improved for them to return home, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said it would terminate Haiti's longstanding Temporary Protected Status program, which has allowed immigrants from the crisis-stricken Caribbean nation to live and work in the U.S. legally since 2010, following the devastating earthquake that year.",
      "If they don't qualify for another legal immigration status \u2014 like asylum or a green card \u2014 those who lose their TPS protections will become ineligible to work in the U.S. legally and eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday urged Haitians with TPS to voluntarily leave the U.S. by using a smartphone app that officials have converted into a system to facilitate self-deportations. The administration has warned immigrants in the U.S. illegally that if they don't self-deport, they will be found, arrested and forcibly deported.",
      "\"This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,\" DHS said in a statement. \"The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.\"",
      "The government estimates that there are 348,187 Haitians in the U.S. with TPS, according to\u00a0a DHS notice. The department said their TPS protections would lapse on Sept. 2.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the federal government to offer migrants work permits and a reprieve from deportation if their home countries are engulfed in a crisis, such as a war or an environmental disaster.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's assertions on Friday, the U.S. government has described Haiti as a country with deep political instability and plagued by gang violence and widespread poverty. In fact, the State Department instructs Americans not to visit Haiti in a Level 4 travel advisory, warning them about the threat of \"robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "The Biden administration vastly expanded the TPS program for Haitians, allowing many of those who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 illegally and legally \u2014 to qualify for the initiative. It also used TPS at an unprecedented scale to offer legal status to hundreds of thousands migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Venezuela, Ukraine and other nations.",
      "But President Trump's administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, as part of its efforts to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, officials have announced plans to terminate TPS protections for Afghans, Cameroonians   and Venezuelans. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed the administration to end the work permits and deportation protections of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans TPS recipients.",

      "The Trump administration has pushed for a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas for weeks, but a deal has proven elusive so far. Israel and Hamas have not publicly commented on whether a deal is possible soon.",
      "Late last month, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire. Under that proposal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages who were taken to Gaza during Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel, according to a copy obtained by CBS News. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians as part of the deal.",

Israel responded with an invasion and intense aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, killing over 56,000 people, according to figures from the territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

      "On Friday, the fight with U.S. higher education started by America's 47th president, Donald Trump, landed at the university founded by its third president, Thomas Jefferson.",
      "The University of Virginia's president, James E. Ryan, submitted his resignation Friday in an effort to resolve Trump administration demands related to a federal\u00a0investigation\u00a0into the school's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The move is the first such pressure campaign on a public university, which is the latest escalation in the Trump administration's months-long national effort to reshape higher education at America's top universities. The Justice Department Civil Rights Division pressured the university to uproot diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as ordered by President Trump, and accused Ryan of simply rebranding them. Multiple sources familiar with the situation told CBS News that the university feared losing federal funding unless a compromise was reached. Ryan's resignation followed.",
      "In a letter to the UVA community, Ryan explained that he \"cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job.\" He nodded to a broad threat of federal action against the university and its students if he remained in office.",
      "\"To do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld,\" Ryan wrote.",
      "A spokesperson for the school said \"UVA is committed to complying with all federal laws and has been cooperating with the Department of Justice in the ongoing inquiries.\"",
      "\"The federal government's support of the University is essential to continue the core mission of research, education and, clinical care,\" said the spokesperson, Brian Coy. The New York Times first\u00a0reported\u00a0Ryan's intention to resign.",
      "A person familiar with the matter described the federal scrutiny as being like a \"nuclear bomb\" going off within the University of Virginia's administration.",
      "This source said lawmakers including senators urged Ryan not to resign and to remain in office until after the state's gubernatorial election concludes in November in case a Democratic candidate replaces Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. A future Democratic governor might then be positioned to challenge Mr. Trump's order, as well as to dismiss Youngkin's conservative appointees to the university's Board of Visitors. That Board voted in the Spring to follow Mr. Trump's orders to excise DEI programs. Youngkin is thought to have presidential aspirations and has embraced Mr. Trump's anti-DEI platform.",
      "If Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger were to defeat Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, she would be able to act to preserve Ryan's standing, they said.",
      "Ryan is known for his efforts to advance diversity both at the University of Virginia and in his previous role as dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Harvard has also been a focus of Trump administration scrutiny, recently suing the federal government over its effort to bar it from admitting international students. Until now private universities, and specifically Ivy league schools had been the prime focus of the Trump administration's education litigation. Those efforts often cited efforts to combat accusations of anti-semitism on campus.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts have resulted in colleges nationwide, including Columbia University and the University of Michigan dramatically scaling back their diversity, equity and inclusion messaging and programs.",

Education was central to his legacy, and he left explicit instructions for his gravestone to be inscribed with three accomplishments: author of the Declaration of independence, author of Virginia's statute of religious freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia.

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled that President Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday struck down President Trump's executive order that sought to punish the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling that it is unconstitutional and blocking the administration from enforcing it.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan caps an unbroken streak of victories for the four major law firms that were targeted by Mr. Trump as part of his efforts to go after his perceived enemies and chose to challenge his directives in court, rather than commit millions of dollars in free legal services, as nine other firms have done.",
      "The president's executive orders aimed to sanction the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Susman Godfrey by going after their clients, access to federal buildings and employees, and security clearances held by their employees.",
      "Each of the four firms filed lawsuits arguing the orders violated the Constitution, and four different judges have skipped trials and ruled in their favor. The Trump administration has not appealed any of the decisions so far.",
      "AliKhan said in her ruling\u00a0that Mr. Trump's executive order regarding Susman Godfrey violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The order, she said, \"is unconstitutional from beginning to end.\"",
      "\"Here, the Order goes beyond violating the Constitution and the laws of the United States,\" the judge wrote. \"The Order threatens the independence of the bar \u2014 a necessity for the rule of law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed the executive order targeting Susman Godfrey in April, which claimed that the firm \"spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.\"",
      "The firm, which has 350 employees, represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News. The suit was filed in response to unfounded claims aired by the network that Dominion helped rig the 2020 election against Mr. Trump. Fox News and Dominion reached a $787 million settlement agreement in 2023.",
      "The president's executive orders against the four law firms all sought to inflict similar harms, including by suspending active security clearances held by their employees, requiring government contractors to disclose any business with the firms and limiting government employees from engaging with their employees. The orders also restricted their access to federal buildings.",
      "Susman Godfrey, like the three others, sued the Trump administration shortly after the executive order was signed, arguing that it violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Lawyers for the firm said Mr. Trump's directive was \"unprecedented and unconstitutional\" and part of \"an express campaign of retaliation for representing clients and causes he disfavors or employing lawyers he dislikes.\"",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump's executive order targeting Perkins Coie went after the firm for its representation of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and its hiring of a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "His attempts to punish Jenner & Block and WilmerHale both invoked lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. At WilmerHale, that was Robert Mueller, the special counsel who led the probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. For Jenner & Block, the lawyer was Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on the Russian meddling case. Mueller, Quarles and Weissmann each left their firms several years ago.",
      "But the firms have also been involved in litigation challenging policies rolled out during Mr. Trump's second term. WilmerHale is representing\u00a0 a group of inspectors general who were fired by the president at the start of his administration, and Jenner & Block is involved in a challenge Mr. Trump's efforts to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people.",
      "Susman Godfrey continues to represent Dominion in defamation lawsuits arising out of baseless claims related to the 2020 election, including against Rudy Giuliani, conservative lawyer Sidney Powell and Newsmax.",
      "AliKhan, who was appointed to the district court by former President Joe Biden, had granted Susman Godfrey temporary relief in April and blocked the administration from enforcing parts of the executive order against the firm. Her final decision in favor of Susman Godfrey was not a surprise, since she had said at a hearing then that the executive order was \"based on a personal vendetta\" against the firm.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" she said in April.",
      "While the four firms have each successfully had the executive orders invalidated, other major firms have decided to enter into agreements with the president, seemingly to avoid being targeted themselves.",
      "Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison was threatened with punishment in March, but Mr. Trump rescinded his executive order focusing on the firm after it committed to providing $40 million in pro bono work to support the administration's policies.",
      "Since then, eight more firms have reached deals with the White House that pledges of between $100 million and $125 million in free legal services. Mr. Trump has suggested using the law firms' promise of pro bono work to help the U.S. in trade negotiations over tariffs.",

      "The agreement brokered by the Trump administration is an effort to stop the bloodshed in the eastern part of the DRC, where a militia allegedly backed by Rwanda occupies large pieces of land. Rwanda has denied directly backing the rebels. Officials from both countries signed the agreement in Washington this week.",
      "\"So we're here today to celebrate a glorious triumph, and that's what it is, for the cause of peace,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office. \"This is a long time waiting. The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda. The conflict has continued and it's been going on for many, many years. It's been going from, I guess they say 30 years.\"",
      "The region has been unstable for decades, and conflict in eastern Congo has led to thousands of deaths recently, and about 6 million deaths over the last three decades, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The conflict has spawned a humanitarian crisis and widespread displacement in eastern DRC.",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. will be \"putting a lot of pressure\" on the countries to honor the agreement.",
      "\"I will just say that there are big penalties if they violate,\" Mr. Trump said, including financial penalties. But, he added, he thinks they'll remain in peace.",
      "The agreement allows for U.S. access to the DRC's deposits of minerals, such as gold, copper and lithium.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday took credit not just for the DRC-Rwanda agreement, but for his administration's role in intervening in other conflicts, too.",
      "\"This is a tremendous breakthrough,\" he said. \"In a few short months, we've now achieved peace between India and Pakistan, India and Iran, and the DRC and Rwanda, and a couple of others, also.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance also praised the president's role in the DRC-Rwanda deal.",
      "\"If I think about what I know about these two countries, for 30 years, pretty much the entire time that I can remember these two countries being in the news, much of the story has been about them fighting one another, about them killing one another,\" Vance said. \"And now, we can look forward to a future where my children will look at this moment as the beginning of a new story, a story of prosperity and peace.\"",

      "Posting on Truth Social\u00a0on Friday afternoon, the president said the U.S. will let Canada know what their tariff rate will be in the next week. The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",
      "\"We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country,\" the president wrote. \"They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately.\"",
      "Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year, will hit tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Meta and Uber with a 3% tax on revenue from users in Canada. The Associated Press reports the retroactive tax bill is expected to cost U.S. companies $2 billion, due at the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' goal of sending President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" to his desk within the next week appears to be on shaky ground as the legislation runs into obstacles in the Senate, with changes that risk bleeding GOP support in the House.",
      "A day after Mr. Trump hosted an event at the White House to pressure lawmakers to pass the bill that includes tax cuts and funding for his border and national security priorities, the president signaled he's open to Republicans' self-imposed deadline slipping past July 4.",
      "\"It's important, it's not the end-all,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday about the deadline. \"We'd like to get it done by that time, if possible.\"",
      "Later in the day, Mr. Trump changed the goal posts again, posting on Truth Social that it \"must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also acknowledged the date may slide past the holiday, but said \"I don't want to even accept that as an option right now.\"",
      "\"We'll see,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota, said Friday afternoon when asked if Mr. Trump's initial comments on the timeline bought him more time to get the package through the Senate.",
      "Senators expect to begin voting on the bill Saturday, but have yet to release the final legislative text. The parliamentarian is continuing to determine which provisions comport with the rules governing the reconciliation process that allow Republicans to pass it with a simple majority.",
      "\"That's aspirational,\" Thune said about holding the first test vote midday Saturday, noting that they are still waiting on the parliamentarian to advise on a number of issues.",
      "The Senate leader also wasn't certain whether he had the votes to advance the legislation.",
      "\"We'll find out tomorrow,\" Thune said.",
      "House Democratic leadership issued guidance to members that votes are not expected over the weekend in the lower chamber and members would receive 48 hours notice before any potential votes next week.",
      "\"We can't make any of these final decisions until we see their bill,\" said Johnson. \"I'm going to give all of my members plenty of time to digest that. The House will not be jammed by anything. I made that commitment.\"",
      "Johnson said members would have 72 hours to review the legislation before a vote.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian's guidance has delivered several blows to key GOP provisions, including an effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from receiving Medicaid benefits and a plan to lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs.",
      "Republicans have already struggled to reach a consensus on the provider tax as a handful of senators have expressed concern about the effects it could have on rural hospitals.",
      "Other recent ruled-out provisions include rolling back regulations on gun silencers, a religious carveout from an expansion of the college endowment tax, a $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "But Republicans can rework provisions that violate the rules and go back to the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, with revised language.",
      "One such provision that received a green light from MacDonough was a revised plan to push some of the costs of food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto states. The benefits are currently funded by the federal government. The revision gives states more flexibility in calculating what their cost share requirement will be beginning in 2028.",
      "The parliamentarian also approved a revision on a proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, House Republicans have drawn red lines on issues including the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and clean energy tax credits. Blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support for the bill before it passed the House in May if the SALT cap was not increased from $10,000. They ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000.",
      "Johnson said he believed the blue-state Republicans would ultimately get on board with a proposal that would set the cap at $40,000 for five years and then revert back to $10,000.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",
      "Both the majority and dissenting opinions included pages from the storybooks, though the justices disagreed as to their messages.",
      "Alito wrote that the books \"unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint about same-sex marriage and gender,\" and are \"designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\"",
      "But in Sotomayor's view, the books introduce readers to LGBTQ characters, but drawn on common themes presented to children in other works, such as overcoming difficulties, celebrating milestones or fairytale romances.",
      "The school board adopted the lessons in 2022 and allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the picture books. But in March 2023, it ended the policy and said families would no longer receive advance notice of when the books would be read, and would not be able to have their children excused from the instruction.",
      "The Board of Education had said that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" since some schools had high numbers of absences. It said all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers had to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, though, sparked backlash throughout the community, with more than 1,000 parents signing a petition that called on the board to restore the opt-outs and dozens appearing at board meetings.",
      "Three Montgomery County families filed a lawsuit against the education board over the decision to end the opt-outs, arguing it violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families are a diverse coalition of religions \u2014 Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox.",
      "A federal district court in Maryland and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled for the school board, finding that there was no evidence that the families were compelled to violate their religious beliefs or conduct.",

      "Family members of the victims of American Airlines flight 5342 \u2014 which collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter outside Washington, D.C., in January \u2014 are urging Congress to do more to address the nation's aging air traffic control system.",
      "As the Senate aims to vote on President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill ahead of the president's July 4 deadline, some advocates \u2014 including relatives of people killed in the American Airlines crash \u2014 say the current funding in the mega-bill is just the beginning of what is needed to overhaul the antiquated airspace system.",
      "\"We are very aware that [the funding] is a down payment only,\" Amy Hunter, cousin to Peter Livingston, who died in the Jan. 29 crash alongside his wife and two daughters, told CBS News. A total of 67 people died in the collision over the Potomac River, including American Airlines passengers and crew as well as the Black Hawk crew members.",
      "\"We have been assured that they understand, and the administration understands, that it has to be followed up basically immediately with the completion of funding for this project,\" Hunter said.",
      "As it stands, the Senate's version of the legislation \u2014 known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 dedicates $12.5 billion to modernizing the air traffic control system. A version passed by the House last month also allocated $12.5 billion to transition from copper wires to fiber optics, buy new radios and build new radar systems in air traffic control facilities nationwide.",
      "This funding is just a fraction of what experts say is needed to completely overhaul the antiquated national airspace system. A coalition of industry groups and airlines has said at least $31 billion is needed for the overhaul.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been clear-eyed that completely overhauling the national airspace system will require more funding.",
      "\"So $12.5 billion is really important. That gives us a start to build this project, which is why I aggressively support the big beautiful Bill. But it's not enough. Again, we need more money,\" Duffy said in a May press conference.",
      "The administration's plans to completely rebuild the air traffic control system include replacing outdated communication technologies, installing new software systems and building six new air traffic control centers for the first time since the 1960s.",
      "The White House has not provided a price tag for what the overhaul would cost, but said they hope to complete the project within four years.",
      "But for the families of AA5342 victims, more action is needed to address the nation's air traffic control system, particularly in the crowded airspace around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where a National Transportation Safety Board review found there were over 15,214 close calls between 2011 and 2024.",
      "The advocates have called for an independent safety review of that airspace, which can be enacted by Congress or asked for by Duffy.",
      "Additionally, several family members of victims told CBS News the Army has not spoken with their family about the crash, which was the deadliest airline accident in the U.S. since November 2001. CBS News has reached out to the Army for comment, but has not received a response.",
      "\"We are grieving families and we are advocates, but we are Americans. We benefit from a strong prepared military and that's what we want to make sure of,\" Rachel Feres, another cousin of the Livingston family, said.",
      "Families say they aren't looking for blame and want to look forward, but they feel that they shouldn't be the only advocates for making the nation's skies safer.",
      "\"We know it's a very long path. For clarity, we think that it shouldn't be a requirement that the families are involved. We should be able to grieve in private,\"\u00a0 Hunter said. \"That is not a reality of today.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported back to his home country and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution, may remain in federal custody, after his lawyers and prosecutors sparred over whether he would be deported immediately upon his release while awaiting a criminal trial.",
      "His lawyers asked that a magistrate judge's order granting him pretrial release not be issued until July 16, when he is scheduled to appear in court again for another hearing. In a filing Friday, prosecutors agreed to the delay. The court must still approve the request.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in a filing with the court that the Justice Department has been giving conflicting statements as to whether the Trump administration will move to deport him before he stands trial.",
      "They said that \"because we cannot put any faith in any representation made on this issue by the DOJ, we respectfully request to delay the issuance of the release order until the July 16 hearing on the government's motion for revocation.\"",
      "\"A short delay will prevent the government from removing Mr. Abrego and allow time for the government to provide reliable information concerning its intentions,\" the lawyers wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia is to be tried on human smuggling charges, but the Trump administration had said that if he were to be released pending trial, he would swiftly be taken into custody by immigration authorities and deported.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors signaled Thursday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would detain and move to deport Abrego Garcia to a third-country \u2014 one that is not his country of origin, El Salvador \u2014 if he were to be released from criminal custody, as was expected. But a Justice Department spokesperson then suggested Abrego Garcia would not be deported until after his criminal trial concludes.",
      "In announcing that Abrego Garcia had been indicted earlier this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi said if he is convicted on the smuggling charges, Abrego Garcia would be returned to El Salvador after completing his sentence.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two counts arising out of what federal prosecutors said was his participation in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle migrants into the U.S. unlawfully. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at a hearing earlier this month.",
      "Abrego Garcia was ordered released by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes after she denied a Justice Department request to keep him detained while awaiting a criminal trial. The Justice Department appealed Holmes' order, but a federal district judge on Wednesday declined to pause her decision. Holmes said earlier this week that Abrego Garcia would remain in U.S. Marshal custody until at least Friday while his lawyers and prosecutors submitted additional filings on his conditions for release.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court, ruling in the birthright citizenship case, reined in federal judges' ability to issue nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump praised the Supreme Court for its decision Friday limiting the ability of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, calling it a \"monumental victory for the Constitution.\"",
      "In comments at the White House, the president said, \"This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch.\"",
      "The Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions by federal judges, a practice the president and his allies have railed against as blocking or hindering their agenda. In a\u00a06-3 decision\u00a0that stemmed from the president's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court said universal injunction orders likely exceeded the authority Congress has given the federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump called the use of nationwide injunctions \"a grave threat to democracy, frankly.\"",
      "Thanks to this decision, the president said the administration can \"now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,\" including his effort to end birthright citizenship. Attorney General Pam Bondi predicted the Supreme Court would \"most likely\" rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship case during the next Supreme Court term, which begins this fall.",
      "Mr. Trump repeated a statement he often makes about birthright citizenship, a provision of the 14th Amendment, saying that it's no longer being used as it was originally intended. \"Hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship, and it wasn't meant for that reason,\" he said. \"It was meant for the babies of slaves.\"",
      "The president thanked Barrett for writing the opinion \"brilliantly,\" and also the justices who sided with her.",
      "In the dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates. Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship,\" and the court's ruling means that \"absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also applauded other Supreme Court rulings, including a decision Friday to allow parents in a Maryland school district to opt their children out of storybooks based on objections to their approach to gender and sexuality.",
      "\"I think the ruling was a great ruling, and I think it's a great ruling for parents,\" the president said.",
      "The president addressed other topics beyond the Supreme Court rulings, too, including his administration's tariffs and his trade negotiations with other countries. Although the president indicated his administration is close to deals with several countries, he said at some point in the next week and a half, his administration will be sending letters to some countries \"and tell them what they have to pay.\"",
      "On Iran, the president expressed support for any new agreement with Iran, including a provision that the International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 or \"somebody\" approved by the U.S. \u2014 act as an independent inspector to examine Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "One reporter asked the president if he would consider bombing Iran again, if U.S. intelligence shows the country can still enrich uranium to a level that concerns him.",
      "\"Sure,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"Without question.\"",
      "At the NATO summit in the Netherlands earlier this week, the president said the U.S. would have talks with Iran \"next week,\" but on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there are currently no plans for formal talks or meetings.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that created a second majority-Black district.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that was approved by the state's GOP-led legislature and created a second majority-Black district.",
      "An order from the court issued on the last day of its term restored the case to its calendar for reargument, with an additional scheduling order to come. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the move to order more arguments and said the court should have decided the case.",
      "The move means the state's map with two majority-Black districts remains intact for now.",
      "The district lines at the center of the dispute were invalidated in 2022 by a three-judge lower court panel, which sided with a group of self-described \"non-African-American voters\" who had challenged the House map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The map wasn't the first crafted by the state's Republican-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census. Instead, Louisiana's efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.",
      "The case demonstrated the challenges state lawmakers face when trying to balance complying with the Voting Rights Act without relying too much on race during the drawing the political lines, which can run afoul of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court's decision is also likely to have implications for the balance of power in the House in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to hold onto their razor-thin majority.",
      "The legal wrangling over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned several years and began after the state legislature redrew the six House districts in early 2022. A federal judge in Baton Rouge ruled that year that the map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it diluted Black voting strength, and ordered the state to put a remedial plan in place that had two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "That initial map had one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts, even though African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The new map adopted by the state legislature reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state lawmakers said. But they said they also had a second goal: to protect powerful Republican incumbents in the House, namely Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow. Letlow is the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, state officials noted.",
      "The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge in the southeast, connecting predominantly Black communities along the way.",
      "But after the new voting lines were adopted, 12 \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged the reconfigured District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel sitting in Shreveport agreed and said the legislature relied too much on race when it drew the new House district lines. Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups \u2014 who were on opposing sides in the challenge to the original map \u2014 to ask the Supreme Court to let the state use the new congressional map for the 2024 elections.",
      "The high court granted their request for emergency relief, and in November, Louisiana voters sent two Black Democrats to Congress. The Supreme Court then agreed to take up the case.",
      "The redistricting dispute is one of several the high court has been confronted with in recent years, and more continue to make their way to the justices. In a landmark 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, which required certain states and localities with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices to receive Justice Department approval before changing their election rules.",
      "Then, in 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have a role to play in deciding legal fights over partisan gerrymandering, when state's voting lines are drawn to entrench the political party in power.",
      "But in an unexpected ruling in 2023, the Supreme Court declined an invitation to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Instead, the high court invalidated Alabama's congressional map crafted after the 2020 Census, which ultimately led to the election of the state's second Black House member.",

      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 during President Joe Biden's term. In Friday's social media video, Hegseth said that the ship's name change was made in line with \"taking the politics out of ship naming.\"",
      "\"We're not renaming the ship to anything political,\" Hegseth said. \"This is not about political activists, unlike the previous administration.\"",
      "\"People want to be proud of the ship they're sailing in,\" Hegseth said.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this month that the Navy was considering renaming the Harvey Milk and multiple naval ships named after civil rights leaders and prominent American voices.",
      "Milk was serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors when he and Mayor George Moscone  were\u00a0assassinated\u00a0in City Hall in 1978. Before his political career, Milk served in the Navy Reserve from 1951 until 1955, according to the National Archives.

    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",

      "A fireball, or a bright meteorite, was seen across the southeastern United States on Thursday and later exploded over Georgia, creating booms heard by residents in the area, according to NASA.",
      "The American Meteor Society said it received more than 160 reports of a fireball sighting from observers in Georgia and South Carolina at 12:25 p.m. ET. The meteor was first seen at an altitude of 48 miles above the town of Oxford, Georgia, moving southwest at 30,000 miles per hour, said Bill Cooke, a lead at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.",
      "The fireball later exploded 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, unleashing an energy of about 20 tons of TNT. Cooke said the fireball was 3 feet in diameter and weighed more than a ton (2,000 pounds).",
      "\"The resulting pressure wave propagated to the ground, creating booms heard by many in that area,\" Cooke said in a statement.",
      "When a space rock enters the atmosphere on its own and burns up, it's called a meteor. It's a meteorite if it survives the trip and makes contact with the ground before burning up. Those that appear especially bright are called fireballs, according to NASA.",
      "This daylight fireball on Thursday could be a member of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, which includes meteors that are rarely seen and are typically active from late June to early July, peaking around June 25, said Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"I would estimate that we receive reports of one daylight event per month from all over the world,\" Lunsford told CBS News. \"I would say one out [of] every 700 fireball events involves a fireball seen during daylight hours. So these events are rare, and most people go a lifetime without seeing one.\"",
      "A fireball during the evening was seen over vast sections of the eastern U.S. and parts of Canada in February 2024.",

      "NASA's Curiosity rover has captured the first close-up images of a part of Mars that scientists say provide evidence of how water once flowed on the red planet.",
      "There were once rivers, lakes and possibly an ocean on Mars, but they eventually dried up and the planet became the desert it is currently, according to NASA.",
      "The new images by Curiosity show \"dramatic evidence\" of ancient groundwater in crisscrossing low ridges, arranged in \"a boxwork pattern,\" stretching across miles of a mountain on Mars, the space agency said.",
      "\"The bedrock below these ridges likely formed when groundwater trickling through the rock left behind minerals that accumulated in those cracks and fissures, hardening and becoming cementlike,\" NASA said in a news release.",
      "The ridges look like spiderweb patterns from space and had previously only been observed from orbit, NASA said.",
      "\"A big mystery is why the ridges were hardened into these big patterns and why only here,\" Curiosity's project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada, said. \"As we drive on, we'll be studying the ridges and mineral cements to make sure our idea of how they formed is on target.\"",

Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",

      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",

      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",

After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",

      "Tracy Smith: What does that tell you?",
      "Tony Rackaukas: Well it tells me there was a lot of hate.",
      "For Blaze's parents, the details of his murder were too much to even imagine.",
      "Jeanne Pepper: I just try not to think about what that really meant. I don't think I \u2014 that I physically can deal with the trauma of what's happened.",
      "As police gathered evidence, the violence that happened in Borrego Park was revealed. With Blaze's body \u2014  his battered phone. Inside Sam Woodward's car \u2014 blood.",
      "Tony Rackaukas: The blood on the headliner, uh, belonged to both Sam Woodward and Blaze Bernstein.",
      "Tracy Smith: Blaze Bernstein's blood was in Sam Woodward's car?",
      "Tony Rackauckas: Yes. Yes.",
      "Tracy Smith: And then they went on to search the house?",
      "Tony Rackauckas: Yes.",
      "Tracy Smith: What kind of forensic evidence did they gather ?",
      "Tony Rackauckas: There was a knife. \u2026 The knife had blood on it. Blaze Bernstein's blood on the knife.",
      "At his arraignment, Sam Woodward would plead not guilty. Investigators would continue to search for what happened that night in Borrego Park. They would soon come to believe that Woodward had a dark and frightening secret.",
      "Sarah Moore: He was involved in this extreme neo-Nazi organization, Atomwaffen Division, which does expect its members to explicitly target members of the Jewish and LGBTQ\u00a0 community.",
      "Sarah Moore monitors hate crime, working for GLAAD, one of the most prominent gay rights organizations in the country.",
      "She has kept a close eye on the small but violent group, Atomwaffen.",
      "Sarah Moore: They want to kind of blow up the world as it is. They want to create something entirely new.",
      "Tracy Smith: And the new thing is what?",
      "Sarah Moore: In their mind it would be a White ethno-state.",
      "Sarah Moore: And there's either no Jewish, or no LGBTQ, or no people of color in that society.",
      "Tracy Smith: How does Atomwaffen recruit?",
      "Sarah Moore: They recruit primarily online.",
      "Just a click away, and exactly where Woodward \u2014 who Raiah Rofsky remembers had trouble making friends \u2014  found some strangers who welcomed and encouraged him.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did you consider yourself a neo-Nazi ?",
      "Former Atomwaffen member: I just considered myself a Nazi.",
      "This man doesn't want his identity revealed. But he says he was once a member of Atomwaffen. And that he came in contact with Sam the year before Blaze was murdered.",
      "Former Atomwaffen member: It was like a camaraderie type of thing \u2026 common interests.",
      "Tracy Smith: And those interests were hating other groups. Hating Jews. Hating gays. Hating Blacks.",
      "Former Atomwaffen member: Yeah. Oh, yeah.",
      "Tracy Smith: How involved was Sam Woodward in Atomwaffen?",
      "Former Atomwaffen member: I know that he was involved.",
      "Involved enough, say investigators, to wear the Atomwaffen mask, give the Nazi salute, make a pilgrimage to Colorado to meet neo-Nazi leader James Mason, and travel to Texas to attend Atomwaffen's version of a corporate retreat. They call it \"hate camp.\"",
      "Sarah Moore: At hate camps, members will get kind of a one-on-one training in how to be a violent extremist.",
      "And that bitter January 2018, when news broke that Blaze had been stabbed to death \u2014 \u00a0allegedly by a member of Atomwaffen \u2014 as Orange County mourned, neo-Nazis reportedly cheered.",
      "Former Atomwaffen member: Everyone was celebrating him. \u2026 Like he killed a gay Jew.",
      "Sarah Moore: Which in their mind is a sort of jackpot.",
      "Tracy Smith: Ugh.",
      "Sarah Moore: It's disgusting.",
      "Jeanne Pepper: There were people congratulating this accused killer for what he had done, killing my son. Congratulating him.",
      "Tracy Smith: Had you ever heard of Atomwaffen?",
      "Jeanne Pepper: No.",
      "Tracy Smith: Before this?",
      "Jeanne Pepper: No. But we should have. Because we're a perfect target for that group.",
      "Because of Sam's involvement in Atomwaffen, seven months after Blaze's murder, prosecutors upped the ante, adding a hate crime enhancement \u2014 a murder motivated by prejudice.",
      "Rabbi Arnold Rachlis: As the story unfolded that the murder was related to homophobia and antisemitism, well then the anger in the community ratcheted up.",
      "For some it brought back the darkest of times.",
      "Tracy Smith: It must seem like all this hate was behind you. That's something from the past.",

      "Tracy Smith: You can't forget it?",
      "Leah Bernstein: Never.",
      "It is a murderous echo from her past, all too real for Grandma Leah, a Holocaust survivor \u2014  once a little girl forced by Hitler's Nazis to wear a yellow star.",
      "Leah Bernstein: Yes we did wear the stars.",
      "Tracy Smith: It's a horrible irony, that what you escaped is \u2014",
      "Leah Bernstein: Is following me.",
      "Sam Woodward was locked up in the Orange County Jail. He would begin his yearslong journey through the justice system. It included a revolving door of defense lawyers who raised questions with the court about Woodward's mental health, and his ability to defend himself. In 2022, Woodward was found competent to stand trial.",
      "Investigators say they also mined Woodward's phone and social media activity. And along with the Nazi propaganda, they found something else. Woodward had visited gay dating and porn sites. And he had exchanged flirtatious messages with Blaze.",
      "Louis Keene: So, they match twice on Tinder.",
      "Louis Keene, a reporter for \"The Forward,\" would cover the case and report on the conversations between Woodward and Blaze.",
      "Louis Keene: Blaze admits that he's gay. \u2026 Blaze says, \"I think you're hot\" \u2026 And Sam says back to Blaze, \"You're not too bad looking yourself, Blaze.\" And so they kind of had this flirty interaction.",
      "Raiah Rofsky: Maybe Sam was like closeted and wanted to hook up.",
      "Rofsky moved to New York City, where she lives as an openly bisexual woman. She still wonders about Woodward's intention, and Blaze's, that tragic night in Borrego Park.",
      "Tracy Smith: The defense may argue that Blaze made a move on Sam and Sam freaked out.",
      "Raiah Rofsky: OK. And if you freak out, does that excuse you stabbing somebody?",
      "In April 2024, Sam Woodward finally headed to trial. Over time, the case had taken on even greater meaning.",
      "Sarah Moore: There's a lot at stake here because it's not just about getting justice for Blaze, but it's also about what precedent this is setting for other LGBTQ+ people who have been or might in the future be in similar situations.",
      "Blaze's parents steadied themselves to relive the night that shattered their lives.",
      "Jeanne Pepper: I know that a lot of things will be said that are probably untrue, because that's what happens in a criminal trial. \u2026 I have an opportunity to defend Blaze and that's what I will do.",
      "MAKING THE CASE FOR HATE",
      "Jeanne Pepper: It's the final thing that I have to do for my son \u2014 is be there and make sure there is some form of justice.",

      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): I just want to thank you for being here and I'm sorry that the circumstances. You remember where you were when you got the phone call?",
      "GIDEON BERNSTEIN: I do remember that, yes.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER: And why does that stand out in your mind?",
      "GIDEON BERNSTEIN: Because it was the beginning of\u2026 hell.",
      "The couple has to come face to face with their son's killer, but the killer, Sam Woodward, doesn't seem to want to be seen.",
      "KENNETH MORRISON: Can I ask you to move the hair out of your face a little bit, maybe pull the hair on your right side \u2026 of your head away so we can see you? Please? Thank you.",
      "SAM WOODWARD: No.",
      "Even before he took the stand, Woodward was already an eerie presence in the courtroom who got everyone's attention.",
      "Louis Keene: Sam looked like Charles Manson \u2026 You couldn't really see his face.",
      "Louis Keene: You couldn't really hear him all the time. \u2026 If you're in the jury he looks extremely menacing.",
      "Tracy Smith: Do you want to look him in the eye?",

      "The question for the jury:",
      "KEN MORRISON (in court): Why this homicide was committed?",
      "Louis Keene: Sam's defense attorney said in opening arguments that we were going to hear from Sam about something that happened that night, that provoked Sam into killing Blaze.",
      "The challenge for defense attorney Ken Morrison is to prove voluntary manslaughter; that Woodward acted impulsively.",
      "KEN MORRISON (in court): There was no cold, calculated decision to kill.",
      "And the knife? According to the defense it wasn't ever meant for murder. From the time Woodward was a Boy Scout, he was never without one.",
      "KEN MORRISON (in court): Would you ever carry a pocketknife with you in your pants pocket?",
      "SAM WOODWARD: Yes I would \u2026 Almost all the time.",
      "KEN MORRISON (in court) Did you have a knife in your pocket when you were with Blaze Bernstein?",
      "SAM WOODWARD: Yes I did.",
      "Prosecutor Jennifer Walker argues this was premeditated murder and a hate crime.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): The killing happened in less than an hour.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER: You'll see the cellphone evidence, the DNA evidence, the defendant's words, the defendant's hate.",
      "In the nearly three months at trial, Walker painstakingly put on almost 20 witnesses including the same former Atomwaffen member who spoke with \"48 Hours,\" now a witness for the prosecution, who still wanted his identity concealed.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER: Do you recognize that?",
      "FORMER ATOMWAFFEN MEMBER: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER: What is it?",
      "FORMER ATOMWAFFEN MEMBER: That's a picture of Samuel Woodward",
      "All to build the case for the added hate charge and a greater sentence.",
      "Louis Keene: The difference is the possibility of parole \u2026 If it's no hate crime, then it's 25 years to life with the possibility of parole. \u2026 if it's a first-degree, premeditated murder and a hate crime, Sam faces life in prison without possibility of parole.",
      "The defense uses a time-honored tactic \u2013 suggesting the victim is not as innocent as he appears.",
      "KENNETH MORRISON (in court): The facts of this case are not simple. You will learn that Blaze Bernstein was not killed because of who he was, but because of what he did.",
      "KENNETH MORRISON: Tell us what happened. \u2026 Sam, can you pick your head up, move your hair?",
      "In Sam Woodward's version, Blaze was toying with him and threatening to out him. Once they were in Borrego Park, Woodward says he smoked a joint.",
      "SAM WOODWARD (in court): I started nodding off.",
      "Woodward says he thought Blaze took a compromising picture.",
      "SAM WOODWARD: I saw my pants unbuckled \u2026 I could practically, like, feel something somewhat close to my leg \u2026 and he had his phone in his hand.",
      "Louis Keene: And he tells us that he believes that Blaze is taking a photo of his privates.",
      "SAM WOODWARD (in court): I just came undone\u2014I went in a state of just terror.",
      "SAM WOODWARD (in court): And I asked, \"What are you doing, what are you doing?\"",
      "No photo was ever found, so there's no evidence that Blaze actually took one.",
      "KEN MORRISON (in court): What were you afraid of?",
      "SAM WOODWARD: I grew up in a home with my mother and my father and I love them more than I can imagine. My father though he \u2014 there's no way not a chance people like him \u2026 just even thinking about the look on his face if he saw something like that, if he'd heard about something like that, that got out somehow, I couldn't fathom that.",
      "Louis Keene: Sam grew up in an ultra-conservative Catholic household. He had parents who believed homosexuality was a sin, but Sam also seemed to have really conflicted feelings about his own sexuality. \u2026 What you come away with is just immense sadness. \u2026 of all these external forces coming to bear on his life \u2026 He did what he did. And what he did can't be undone.",
      "KEN MORRISON (in court): Any idea how long it took to stop stabbing Blaze?",
      "SAM WOODWARD: No idea. No.",
      "Louis Keene: It was one of the most awful things I've ever heard \u2026 and you know that Blaze's parents are sitting there \u2026 for months of this trial, they've been hearing \u2026 their son is accused of sexual assault \u2026 you can't really imagine what that's like. Jeanne Pepper \u2026 walked out of the room.",
      "For the prosecution, the only predator in this story is Sam Woodward.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): He has a six-inch knife out and Blaze is the predator? Blaze is the problem here?",
      "JENNIFER WALKER: That's what's being sold to you by the defendant. \u2026 He was interested and fixated on hate. Atomwaffen Division had that outlet for him.",
      "Only two people know what really happened that night. Sam Woodward has had his say. Blaze Bernstein isn't alive to tell us.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): You should find him guilty of first-degree murder with the hate crime. It's the only reasonable conclusion.",
      "KENNETH MORRISON (in court): Do you have any hesitation? Do you have any doubt?",
      "Now it's up to the jury.",
      "CELEBRATING BLAZE BERNSTEIN'S LEGACY WITH LOVE",
      "The passage of time has been doubly hard for Blaze's grandparents Richard and Leah, still waiting for justice for the grandson they loved and lost.",
      "Leah Bernstein: I miss him all. Everything about him. He was loving and caring. He was handsome too. (smiles)",
      "Blaze and his exceptional appetite for life.",
      "Richard Bernstein: I tried to treat him as just a normal kid, you know. And he turned out uh \u2014 (breaks down)",

      "Richard Bernstein: He turned out well.",
      "On July 3, 2024, the jurors began their deliberations.",
      "Leah Bernstein: I don't want him to die. I want him to suffer every day of his life.",
      "Tracy Smith: Is there a part of you that wants to look that young man in the eye?",
      "Richard Bernstein: No.",
      "Tracy Smith: Why not?",
      "Richard Bernstein: Because he's a footnote in history.",
      "Whether footnote or headline, grandparents, parents, Rabbi, or oldest friend, It felt like forever.",
      "Raiah Rofsky:\u00a0 I was nervous, and I felt anxiety because I was not sure what the verdict was going to be",
      "2,364 days after his arrest, Sam Woodward's fate is on the line: living and dying in prison. Or someday possibly walking free.",
      "It took the jury eight hours.",

      "COURT CLERK: We the jury \u2026 find the defendant Samuel Woodward guilty of the crime of first-degree murder.",
      "JEANNE BERNSTEIN (reacts off camera) Thank God! (cries)",
      "Guilty of murder. But was it \"hate\"? Did Woodward target Blaze because he was gay? The jury spoke again.",
      "COURT CLERK: We the jury \u2026 find it to be true that the defendant Samuel Woodward committed hate crime first-degree murder.",
      "Outside the Orange County courtroom all that pain and uncertainty overflowed.",
      "The current D.A. offered thoughts on love and law.",
      "D.A. TODD SPITZER (addressing reporters): We don't care who you love, or who you want to be with. \u2026 You deserve to be a free person with free will and love who you love. And that needs to be protected.",
      "JEANNE PEPPER (adressing reporters): We are thrilled with the verdict, which holds Samuel Woodward accountable for the brutal, violent, painful murder of our son, brother, grandson, cousin, Blaze Bernstein on January 3rd, 2018.",
      "Louis Keene: His parents will never get to speak to him again. \u2026 And that loss is incalculable. The Woodwards also lost their son. He's going to prison.",
      "Raiah Rofsky: When the verdict was that the murder was a hate crime, that essentially meant that there is the proof that Blaze was murdered because he was gay and Jewish. Simple as that.",
      "For Rofsky, who Blaze first came out to, on that California beach \u2014",
      "Raiah Rofsky: In my head I was telling Blaze \"we finally got him.\" \u2026 Like, you know, case closed.",
      "And says the prosecutor, Woodward should pay the maximum price.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (addressing reporters): He faces life without possibility of parole. And that's what we'll be asking for.",
      "Experts who monitor Atomwaffen say it has largely dissolved. But that the threat of hate groups remains today.",
      "Tracy Smith: You said, \"love who you love\" \u2026 it sounds so simple \u2026 but it's not.",

      "Hundreds gathered Saturday morning at Minneapolis' Basilica of St. Mary for the private funeral of Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark and their dog, Gilbert.",
      "Gov. Tim Walz and Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of the Hortmans, spoke at the service, which was a traditional Catholic Mass said by Father Dan Griffith. Walz also served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history \u2013 and I'll always remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I've ever known,\" Walz said in his eulogy. \"For seven years, I've had the privilege of signing her bills into law. And I know that millions of Minnesotans will get to live better lives because she and Mark chose public service.\"",
      "Melissa Hortman was remembered for her leadership, sense of humor and strong commitment to doing good work to improve the lives of Minnesotans.",
      "\"Her mission was to get as much good done for as many people as possible,\" Walz said. \"That focus on people is what made Melissa so effective. She knew how to get her way, no doubt about it. But she never made anyone feel like they'd gotten rolled at the negotiating table.\"",
      "Mark Hortman shared his wife's passion for helping others, Walz said, the two having met at a mentorship event in Washington, D.C., more than 30 years ago.",
      "\"...There's a part of the story that belongs only to those of us fortunate enough to know the people behind that legacy,\" Walz said. \"It takes place at CR's Billiards, where Mark loved to shoot pool on Monday nights. It takes place in the garden, where Melissa fussed over her lilies like they were wayward members of the caucus. It takes place in the kitchen, where Mark fed his sourdough starter and Melissa mixed margaritas and baked cakes and Gilbert begged for scraps and the sound of laughter filled the air.\"",
      "The governor encouraged people to learn from the way the Hortmans lived to honor their legacy.",
      "\"Maybe this is a moment when each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for the things we care about. A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did \u2013 fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity,\" Walz said. \"But let's not do it because of the way Mark and Melissa died. Let's do it because of the way they lived, and the way they led. With joy and passion. With respect and empathy. With purpose and humility.\"",
      "Griffith said the Hortmans would regularly open their Brooklyn Park home to guests, adding they referred to it as the \"Hortman Hotel.\"",
      "\"Everyone was welcome,\" Griffith said. \"I can't believe how Melissa and Mark lived community with that degree of intentionality. It's a beautiful thing.\"",
      "In her eulogy, Williams added that the evenings Mark and Melissa Hortman spent with their friends \"held a sacrosanct position\" on their calendars.",
      "\"We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again. And Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way,\" she said.",
      "Colin Hortman, the son of Mark of Melissa, gave the prayer alongside his fianc\u00e9e. He recited the Prayer of St. Francis, a copy of which he says Melissa Hortman kept in her wallet.",
      "Among attendees were former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who were invited to the funeral by Walz on behalf of the Hortmans' children.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar was unable to attend the Hortmans' funeral in person, but praised their leadership.",
      "\"They met as volunteers working to help kids, and that dedication to serving others never wavered,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.. \"Sophie and Colin said that the best way to honor their parents is 'to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.' I can think of no better way to honor Melissa and Mark.\"",
      "In the days following their deaths, the Hortman children, in a statement remembering their parents, encouraged people to honor their memory with a list of actions, including baking, petting a dog and planting a tree.",
      "Hortmans lie in state",
      "The funeral comes one day after the Hortmans and their dog laid in state in the Minnesota Capitol Rotunda. Melissa Hortman is the first woman to ever have the honor.",
      "Walz was among the first mourners to visit the rotunda on Friday. Later Friday afternoon, former President Joe Biden arrived at the State Capitol rotunda to pay tribute.",
      "People began arriving before 10 a.m. Friday, standing on the Capitol steps to make sure they were in place for their chance to pay tribute to the lawmaker many say perfected the art of compromise \u2014 working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what she thought was best for all Minnesotans.",
      "\"It's an honor to be here,\" said Julie Johnson, of Rochester. \"Melissa was just such a giving, selfless servant for everybody.\"",
      "Some came with flowers. Others wore their hearts on their sleeves, devastated by the loss of the people's lawmaker who worked for decades to make the lives of all Minnesotans better.",
      "Minnesota Department of Public Safety Assistant Commissioner John Cunningham said 7,500 people paid respects at the Capitol rotunda on Friday.",
      "Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota House for 11 terms, representing District 34B, after being elected to the legislature in 2004. She also spent several years in the role of House Speaker.",
      "Melissa Hortman and her husband leave behind two children.",
      "Since her killing, many have been praising her leadership. On Thursday, U.S. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Delano, honored her on the House floor as a bridge builder.",

    "summary": "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also posted that the bill would be \"political suicide for the Republican Party.\"",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday doubled down on his distaste for President Trump's sprawling tax and spending cuts bill, arguing the legislation that Republican senators are scrambling to pass would kill jobs and bog down burgeoning industries.",
      "\"The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,\" Musk wrote on X on Saturday as the Senate was scheduled to call a vote to open debate on the nearly 1,000-page bill. \"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\"",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, whose birthday is also Saturday, later posted that the bill would be \"political suicide for the Republican Party.\"",
      "The criticisms reopen a recent fiery conflict between the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency and the administration he recently left. They also represent yet another headache for Republican Senate leaders who have spent the weekend working overtime to get the legislation through their chamber so it can pass by Mr. Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Musk has previously made his opinions about Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" clear. In late May, just a few days before he officially left his post in the federal government, he told \"CBS Sunday morning\" he was \"disappointed\" with the bill's price tag.",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS News.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk added. \"But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "Following a laudatory celebration in the Oval Office, his language became more aggressive and he blasted the bill as \"pork-filled\" and a \"disgusting abomination.\"",
      "\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he wrote on X earlier this month. In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who had recently forecasted that he'd step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who \"betrayed the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Mr. Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The president also threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies. SpaceX receives tens of billions of dollars in federal money, most of which are in the form of federal grants from NASA.",
      "\"He's got a lot of money, he gets a lot of subsidy,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on June 6. \"So we'll take a look at that. Only if it's fair for him and for the country. I would certainly think about it, but it has to be fair.\"",
      "Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that \"went too far.\" Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, \"Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.\"",
      "The shocking rift came after Musk donated $277 million to Trump's presidential campaign and other Republican candidates in the last election cycle, according to campaign finance records.",
      "It's unclear how Musk's latest broadsides will influence the fragile peace he and the president had enjoyed in recent weeks. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Musk has spent recent weeks focused on his businesses, and his political influence has waned since he left the administration.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of motorists were stranded for more than eight hours along a section of rural interstate highway in southern West Virginia early Friday after a mudslide caused by heavy rains blocked a storm drain the previous night, flooding and completely shutting down the northbound lanes.",
      "Traffic backed up for 12 miles along the West Virginia Turnpike about 20 miles south of Charleston, the state capital. Traffic was not rerouted, and many motorists along the mountainous route had no choice but to remain in their vehicles overnight.",
      "One lane eventually opened in the early morning of Friday but traffic remained a standstill afterwards for hours, according to a statement provided to CBS News by West Virginia Department of Transportation spokesperson Jennifer Dooley.",
      "\"Traffic should have been detoured to allow drivers an alternate route around the mudslide,\" Executive Director of the Parkways Authority Chuck Smith said in the statement. \"The Parkways Authority takes full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, and would like to assure the public that this will never happen again.",
      "No injuries were reported, Smith said, adding that the Parkways Authority is \"examining and revising its policies on Turnpike closures and detours as a result of this incident.\"",
      "Motorists posted on social media that they had no information on why the standstill occurred, that they had nothing to drink in their vehicles or that their children needed to use the bathroom.",
      "Nicky Walters said in a telephone interview that she felt fortunate while she was stuck because she is healthy, did not not need medicine and had nobody she was responsible for caring for.",
      "\"But I felt desperate because I knew that other people needed help,\" said Walters, who became stranded while returning to Charleston from a pro wrestling event in Mount Hope. \"People needed, at minimum, water bottles passed out and some snacks, much less information. They needed any lifeline to the outside world, and there was none.\"",
      "By the time Brittany Lemon and her family finally got home to Parkersburg, 24 hours had passed since they began returning from their vacation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.",
      "In a video posted to Facebook, Lemon said she had no water and her children needed to use the bathroom. They were able to get an hour's sleep while stuck on the highway.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-in-trump-big-beautiful-bill-senate-version/",
    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Republicans released an updated version of the legislation late Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans released the latest version of President Trump's massive spending and tax bill late Friday as the GOP eyes an ambitious July 4 deadline to approve the centerpiece legislation of the president's second-term agenda.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate Republicans have been putting their imprint on the bill. But GOP leaders are seeking a middle ground to appease the upper chamber without alienating House Republicans, who will have to approve the Senate's changes before the bill can head to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "At the center of the bill is an extension to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, slated to sunset at year's end, seeking to make the cuts permanent in what has been a key priority for Senate Republicans. It also includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.",
      "But along with different dynamics in the Senate, Republicans have also been contending with input from the Senate's rulekeeper, known as the parliamentarian. She has been weighing in on the bill's components to determine whether they may fly under the reconciliation process, which allows the GOP to move forward with the bill without any support from across the aisle.",
      "Here's what's in the Senate's updated version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" some of which remains in flux:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in the Senate in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $25 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "However, Alaska and Hawaii would receive temporary exemptions from the cost-sharing requirement. Both states would receive a two-year reprieve if the Department of Agriculture determines they are \"actively implementing a corrective action plan.\"",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18-64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could also receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill, as Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, outlining that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime. But the provisions would expire in 2028. The Senate bill would reduce the deductions for individuals making over $150,000, while the House bill does not include income limits.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",
      "Asylum fee",
      "The legislation also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and other fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "AI moratorium",
      "A revised proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence also made it into the Senate bill. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",
      "Public lands",
      "The Senate version would order the sale of up to 0.5% of public lands in 11 states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. Eligible lands would have to be located within 5 miles of a population center and the sale of federally protected lands is prohibited.",

      "A record heat wave that spread across the East Coast of the United States during the first week of summer has child advocates warning parents and caretakers about the risks of heatstroke to children left inside hot vehicles.",
      "So far this year, nine\u00a0children have died\u00a0after being left unattended in vehicles in California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New Jersey and North Carolina, according to Kids and Car Safety, which collects data on hot car deaths. Five died in June.",
      "According to\u00a0data from advocacy group Kids and Car Safety, on average, 38 children die each year from heatstroke inside a vehicle. Since 1990, at least 1,134 children have died in hot cars in the United States and at least another 7,500 survived with varying degrees of injury, according to data compiled by Kids and Car Safety.",
      "Why hot cars are so dangerous for kids",
      "Human-caused climate change keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists say. But the temperature outside doesn't have to be super hot for a child left in a vehicle to be affected by the heat, said Kathy Wall, director of Safe Kids Palm Beach County.",
      "\"Inside, the vehicle can heat up 20 degrees in just 20 minutes,\" Wall said. \"So if you imagine it's an 80 degree day, which in South Florida is a cool day, it could be over 100 degrees within 10 minutes inside the car.\"",
      "Hot car deaths can happen any time of year, and since 1998, every state but Alaska has reported a hot car death, according to the National Safety Council. In both 2018 and 2019, a record 53 children died after being left in hot cars.",
      "About 80% of the heat rise in vehicles happens in the first 30 minutes of a child being left inside, when maximum temperatures can exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), according to data compiled by Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist at San Jose State University.",
      "\"Children sweat a lot less than adults do and their internal temperature can increase three to five times faster than an adult. So that's why it's just as important to make sure that your child isn't left in the vehicle, especially during these rising temperatures,\" said Capt. Karen Derogatis of Palm Beach County Fire Rescue.",
      "Last week, a 5-year-old boy in Mansfield, Ohio, died after being left in a hot vehicle.",
      "It can happen to anyone",
      "While it's easy to place blame for leaving a child in a vehicle, even people trained to know the dangers have made that tragic mistake, Wall said.",
      "\"It's not a socioeconomic group, it's not a cultural group,\" she said. \"This sadly has happened to doctors, it's happened to dentists, it happened to school teachers, it's happened to child care workers. Nobody is exempt from this.\"",
      "Distraction often leads to forgetting about a child in the backseat, which is why it is important to create routines and reminders, she said.",
      "\"It sounds crazy, but sometimes people get out of routines or are distracted, especially in today's world. There's lots going on in the news, lots going with families,\" she said.",

      "She encourages parents and caregivers to establish routines.",
      "\"We have an acronym, ACT,\" Wall said.",
      "\"A\" stands for avoiding leaving a child unattended in a vehicle. \"C\" stands for creating a reminder that works best for you. Authorities suggest leaving a personal item such as a purse or briefcase in the backseat so you'll have to open the back door before locking the vehicle. \"T\" is to take action right away.",
      "\"If you see a child in a car, don't try to figure out how long they've been in the car. Call 911 immediately,\" Wall said.",

    "story": [
      "New Orleans\u00a0\u2014 As the Atlantic hurricane season\u00a0has gotten underway, a new study published Friday by researchers at Tulane University reveals hotspots in New Orleans' concrete flood walls which had been strengthened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.",
      "The study found that the city's concrete flood walls are sinking faster than sea levels are rising, reducing capacity to block storm surges in some neighborhoods.",
      "\"There is certainly a potential in the future, if these rates continue, to degrade our level of protection of the flood protection system,\" Tulane professor Mead Allison, a co-author on the study, told CBS News.",
      "This summer marks 20 years since Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, leaving more than 1,300 people dead and displacing more than a million people across the region.",
      "Following the destructive storm, $15 billion was spent to reinforce a levy system designed to keep water out. New Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on this elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals.",
      "The study, published in the journal Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track shifts in ground elevation across the Greater New Orleans area between 2002 and 2020. It found that while most of the city remains stable, some neighborhoods, wetlands, and even sections of the region's post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking by more than an inch per year \u2014 with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters, or nearly 2 inches, of elevation loss annually.",
      "\"In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,\" said Simone Fiaschi \u2014 lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's\u00a0Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira \u2014 in a statement.",
      "\"These results are a wake-up call,\" Allison said. \"We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.\"",
      "If trends continue, and infrastructure is left unchecked, the study found wetlands east of the city could transform marshes into open water within the next 10 years if trends continue \u2014 effectively eliminating critical storm surge buffers to the Louisiana coast.",
      "The study also identified some potential causes of the sinking hotspots. It found pockets of land are sinking around industrial sites, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, and newer residential developments \u2014 areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors.",
      "Researchers said the findings also underscore a few potential solutions to better protect New Orleans and other coastal communities across the globe, including frequent upgrades to the flood protection system and satellite monitoring.",
      "Some residents living in the Michoud neighborhood on the city's east side \u2014 one of the areas identified in the study as sinking more rapidly than others \u2014 are concerned that maintenance won't be prioritized. Michoud   resident Synthia Viltus pointed out that potholes and other smaller infrastructure issues in her neighborhood have remained unresolved for months.",
      "\"I have zero faith in state federal leaders to keep the levies updated,\" Viltus said.",
      "The study did find a positive \u2014 some areas where industrial activities had been halted had actually caused the land to lift back up.",
      "The study's authors also hope their work will help guide other coastal cities who may be facing similar challenges to New Orleans.",
      "\"This research shows that land movement isn't uniform, and understanding these patterns is crucial for protecting lives and property in a city where inches truly matter,\" Fiaschi said in the statement. \"However, it's crucial to remember that our results still require careful ground-truthing. This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.\"",
      "Ricky Boyett, spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans, said the urgent levee systems in the city were designed and built to withstand projected levels of land sinking until 2057.",
      "\"Every levee system in South Louisiana is subject to settlement, subsidence and sea level rise,\" Boyett said in a statement. \"As a result, periodic levee lifts are required to maintain the established level of risk reduction, whether that be the New Orleans Hurricane system, Mississippi River levees or other systems in the region.\"",
      "The USACE says it's already planning a major upgrade overhaul to the infrastructure so it can withstand a half-century of time passing \u2014 and the expected changes in elevation that may unfold throughout those years \u2014 until 2073.",
      "Meanwhile, the Tulane researchers say they were commissioned to conduct this study by the state, which manages the levees. They say this study was only the first phase of a two-part series. Phase two will use the same technology to examine wetland sinkage along the southernmost areas of Louisiana's coast \u2014 the first line of defense to protect against a hurricane's surge.",

      "\"An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,\" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident.",
      "Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet\u00a0over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing,\u00a0the NTSB discovered after the fact.",
      "\"The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident \u2026 to Boeing and to the FAA \u2026 and were therefore preventable,\" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday.",
      "The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries.",
      "In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming \"Boeing's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled.\"",
      "Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight.",
      "\"Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,\" the report said.",
      "In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday.",
      "\"The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,\" the FAA's statement said. \"We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes.\"",
      "The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft.",
      "\"We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,\" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting.",
      "When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts \u2014 and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel.",
      "When asked whether all of it can be blamed on human error on the manufacturing floor at Boeing, Homendy told CBS News there needed to be a design change or a better process.",
      "\"It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,\" she said.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident.",

We all want to feel safe when we board a Boeing plane.\"",
      "Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has \"no concerns\" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety.",

    "story": [
      "Novo Nordisk is pulling the plug on its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the telehealth company sold fake versions of the pharmaceutical firm's weight-loss drug, Wegovy.",
      "The Danish drugmaker said\u00a0Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold \"illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk.\"",
      "Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies\u00a0said\u00a0they were entering a \"long-term collaboration\" to make obesity treatment more accessible.",
      "Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement.",
      "Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",
      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF.",
      "In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA.",
      "\"U.S. patients should not be exposed to knock-off drugs made with unsafe and illicit foreign ingredients,\" Novo Nordisk said.",
      "Novo Nordisk will continue to sell Wegovy on other telehealth platforms that \"share our commitment to patient safety,\" said Dave Moore, executive vice president at Novo Nordisk, in the company's\u00a0statement. Among the telehealth companies Novo Nordisk partners with are LifeMD and Ro.",

      "Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade association that represents the health insurance industry, announced Monday that some of its biggest members are taking steps to streamline \"prior authorization\" \u2014 industry jargon for the process by which health care providers obtain approval from patients' insurance carriers to deliver care.",
      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",

      "Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 72 people from Friday into Saturday morning, officials with the Hamas-run health ministry said.",
      "Among those killed were 12 people near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people, according to staff at Shifa hospital where the bodies were brought, the Associated Press reported. More than 20 bodies were taken to Nasser Hospital, according to health officials. A strike midday Saturday killed 11 people on a street in eastern Gaza City, and their bodies were taken to Al-Ahli Hospital.",
      "Three children and their parents were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent camp in Muwasi near the southern city of Khan Younis. They were struck while sleeping, relatives said.",
      "\"What did these children do to them? What is their fault?\" said the children's grandmother, Suad Abu Teima.",
      "The strikes come as President Trump on Friday said there could be a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas within the next week.",
      "\"I think it's close,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the prospect of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. \"We think within the next week, we're going to get a ceasefire.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have not publicly commented on the status of any potential agreement.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed for a pause in fighting since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January. However, a deal has proven elusive so far. Talks have been on again, off again since Israel broke the latest ceasefire in March, continuing its military campaign in Gaza and furthering the Strip's dire humanitarian crisis.",
      "Late last month, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff\u00a0proposed a 60-day ceasefire. Under that proposal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages who were taken to Gaza during Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel, according to a copy obtained by CBS News. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians as part of the deal.",
      "Israel supported that proposal, but Hamas\u00a0said\u00a0it responded with \"some notes and amendments.\" Witkoff called the response from Hamas \"totally unacceptable\" in\u00a0a May 31 post on X.",
      "An official with knowledge of the situation told the AP that Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, will arrive in Washington next week for talks on Gaza's ceasefire, Iran and other subjects. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Some 50 hostages remain in Gaza, fewer than half of them believed to still be alive. They were part of some 250 hostages taken when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparking the 21-month-long war.",
      "The war\u00a0has killed over 56,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It says more than half of the dead were women and children.",
      "There is hope among hostage families that Trump's involvement in securing the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran might exert more pressure for a deal in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is riding a wave of public support for the\u00a0Iran war and its achievements,\u00a0and he could feel he has more space to move toward ending the war in Gaza, something his far-right governing partners oppose.",
      "Hamas has repeatedly said it is prepared to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu says he will only end the war once Hamas is disarmed and exiled, something the group has rejected.",
      "Meanwhile, hungry Palestinians are enduring a catastrophic situation in Gaza. After blocking all food for 2 1/2 months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since mid-May.",
      "Efforts by the United Nations to distribute the food have been plagued by armed gangs looting trucks and by crowds of desperate people offloading supplies from convoys.",
      "Palestinians have also been shot and wounded while on their way to get food at newly formed aid sites, run by the American and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to Gaza's health officials and witnesses.",

      "The caskets of Guard's chief Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard's ballistic missile program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh and others were driven on trucks along the capital's Azadi Street as people in the crowds chanted: \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel.\"",
      "Salami and Hajizadeh were both killed on the first day of the war, June 13, as Israel launched a war it said meant to destroy Iran's nuclear program, specifically targeting military commanders, scientists and nuclear facilities.",
      "State media reported more than 1 million people turned out for the funeral procession, which was impossible to independently confirm, but the dense crowd packed the main Tehran thoroughfare along the nearly three-mile route.",
      "There was no immediate sign of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in the state broadcast of the funeral. Khamenei, who has not made a public appearance since before the outbreak of the war, has in past funerals held prayers for fallen commanders over their caskets before the open ceremonies, later aired on state television.",

More than 1,000 people were killed, including at least 417 civilians, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group.",

    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025. The interview was taped on June 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, welcome to the program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Thank you very much, Margaret. Good to talk to you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director General, there is so much happening. I'm hoping you can walk us through what you know. Iran's foreign minister has said that the damage to their nuclear facilities from the U.S. bombing is significant and serious. We know Israel has also killed a number of top Iranian nuclear scientists. What exactly is Iran's capability at this moment?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, yes, and I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but you will see that there is an agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage. It can be, you know, described in different ways, but it's clear that what happened in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has, to some degree, capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those- of those capabilities. This is- this is clear. And now the important issue- the important thing is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very important, the material that they will be producing if they continue with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is connected. This is- this is contingent on negotiations which may or may not restart, so- so what we see this here, I think we have a snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned there diplomacy. President Trump has been calling for diplomatic talks with Iran to settle all the issues around the nuclear program. I know you were in regular contact with envoy Steve Witkoff. Are you talking to him now? Will the IAEA be involved in any agreement?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, at some point we will have to be, because if his efforts, which I support wholeheartedly, succeed, this will come to a point where there is some agreement, some understanding on things that Iran will continue doing, and some things where there could be an agreement on certain restrictions. And of course, who is going to verify that is the IAEA so this is why we're in constant contact. Now they need to reconnect. And it's not going to be easy, one can imagine, after the traumatic events that took place. Even for us, you may have seen that I wrote to Foreign Minister Araghchi a few days ago, immediately, I would say, after the cease-fire was considered to be holding, and I said to him that we should perhaps sit down and analyze in a gradual way the reconnection, the modalities for the inspectors to go- to go back. So there is a level where the IAEA is not involved, and this is the direct conversation. What is the deal? And then, of course, we will be connecting to make sure that that deal stands and it's verifiable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, Tehran just passed a law saying they want to suspend cooperation with the IAEA inspectors. The foreign minister said he had no plans to let you personally, Mr. Director General, into the country. Does that mean Iran will completely block all inspectors? Do those you already have in the country have any access?",
      "GROSSI: Well, certainly I hope this is not the case. I think that what the foreign minister said is that they were looking into this law and how this law would impact our activities. I think it's time- this is why it's so important that we sit down around the table and we look into this. Iran- and I think nobody has put that in question, and I hope nobody will, is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, like more than 190 countries in the world. So- so, that implies that they have to work with the- with the agency. So we have to go- we have been going through this law that they have, that the Majles approved, and we see that they are talking about cooperation on the basis of- of the security and the safety of their sites. I think that is not incompatible with the inspection work that needs to take place. But of course, it's not Rafael Grossi and Margaret Brennan discussing this that we are going to solve it. I think we- I have to sit down with- with- with Iran and look into this, because at the end of the day, this whole thing, after the military strikes, will have to have a long lasting solution, which cannot be but a diplomatic one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're not kicking- they're not kicking out your inspectors at this point?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Not in this sense. I would not say that I am looking with interest and with some concern what they have approved. But of course, it's their law. It is their parliament. But you know, here there are legal implications. An international treaty, of course, takes precedence. You cannot invoke an internal law not to abide with an international treaty. But Iran is not saying that at the moment, and I think this is constructive. So this is why I think we have to go down into the details, because the work will have to continue, otherwise nobody will have an idea of what is happening in Iran. Iran will continue with a nuclear program, the contours of which are still to be seen and will be I am sure, part of these negotiations, which I hope, will be resuming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran officially reported weeks ago that they were going to take measures in advance of these strikes to try to protect their nuclear assets. Did they share with the IAEA what those plans were? Where they were going to stash things like centrifuges, the machines that help enrich fuel? Where they were going to put the gas canisters that have enriched uranium?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: No, no, they did not inform that- that to us, but at the same time, there was no physical time, perhaps, to do it. Iran, for example, had announced to us that they had a new enrichment facility in Isfahan, and we were going to go on the 13th of June to- to check on that facility so that- and the site has been severely damaged and hit. So this is why I say it is indispensable. We will have to, aggravation or not, feelings and emotions or not, there has to come a point with- with cool heads. We sit around the table and- and see what- I mean, these protective measures, of course, it's their right to protect their assets, like any other sovereign nation. They can, of course, protect- but they know and there are, I don't want to get too technical or legalese here in this conversation, but there are provisions in the agreements we have, not only with Iran, with any- with any country. If a country at a- at a moment, feels that some of the things we inspect must be protected or whatever, they have to tell us, and we have to go, etc., etc., as you can imagine. So, this could not happen because of the unfolding of the circumstances, of a military conflict where, of course, you know, decisions are taken and this is not planned or announced, obviously. So now- now it's the time to reconnect and to talk and to talk to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, but there was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium, before the attacks. I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved, and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's- it's logical to presume that when they announce that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But, as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved. So there has to be at some point a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as- as a potential problem. So this is why I say it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask you about what things might still remain, because there's that open question of could Iran sprint towards a bomb even now, if they wanted to. If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is that still a risk that they could be rushing towards a bomb?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, you know, I- we don't want to be alarmists here, and I don't want to be part of, you know, a messaging that would be spreading, as I say, alarm. But we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened. Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there. The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily. You are going to have an agreement. You are going to have an inspection system that will give everybody, everybody in the region and- and- and elsewhere, the assurances that we can- we can definitely turn the page.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until right before the strikes, the IAEA still had inspectors, as I understand it, going to some of these sites. There's been a lot of focus here in America on the trucks and satellite images of them outside of Fordo. What was happening in those days before the strike?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, as- as you were pointing out there were- there was an announcement of protective measures that could have included moving equipment and material. We don't know. We saw the same images that the whole world has seen of these trucks, and we don't want to get into any rush conclusion about it, but it is, it is clear that we need the things that we ignore, okay. And after a reasonable period, after the war, there has to be a process that needs to continue. Otherwise the uncertainties will continue, will continue to linger on. And this is, you know, in a final analysis, not good, and perhaps even preventing a good agreement, because who is going to have an agreement where you don't know what the counterpart really has? What are the assets that they really have after the- after this- this- this military campaign that took place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until these strikes Iran- Iran was still disclosing information to the IAEA--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --Well yes, yes, yes, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-In certain amounts--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: There were deficits. There were deficits, and we were referring to those in the- in the sense that there were some things that they were not clarifying to us. But our inspection work was- was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was- it was complete. It was comprehensive. And, of course, at the moment, there is- there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. The world was concerned--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You said you were concerned about it. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested they were looking to weaponize?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They- let me be clear here, because we said, first of all, something very, very important. They have all these capabilities, but for the agency, they- first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons. Okay? This needs to be said. One can have an assessment nationally that they were close, okay? And I don't get into that, because we, the IAEA, does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So it is countries that- that say, well, this is of concern or not. What we were concerning- what- what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we had found traces of uranium in some places in Iran, which were not the normal declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place x, y or z? And we were simply not getting credible answers. If there was material- where is this material? So there could be even more. We don't know. This is why it is, I'm sorry I'm repeating it for the third time, I think we need to go back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, understood. But your statement and that report that you gave about some of these open questions or unanswered questions, the Iranians are pointing to it now, and the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. He said it wasn't honest and fair, your report. He said, after the facilities, you didn't even condemn the strikes- after the strikes, I should say. What do you make of those criticisms?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well- I, to an extent, I understand. They have been under attack. But, really, who can believe that this conflict happened because of a report of the IAEA? And, by the way, what was- what was in that report was not new, Margaret. We have been saying that for a long time, and in previous reports as well. So, this- maybe it's because it's easier, maybe, to criticize an international organization or a director general, I don't know, but it's not reasonable to say that. And, if anything, the IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that- that were saying in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. And we didn't. We simply didn't, because this was not what we were seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Absolutely, because we have to see everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They did- we didn't see them. We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending. So this is- this is the truth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I appreciate the nuance here, because there's so much gray. People here are looking for clarity, and there's confusion in the United States. CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back a few months, but once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the National Intelligence directors say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years. What's the truth here? What do you make of these assessments?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: You know- you know what, this hourglass approach in weapons of mass destruction is- is not a good idea. Remember, we had cases 45 minutes and so on, which were quite- quite off spot. All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. If you tell me it will take them two months or three months, for what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.",
      "Because, first of all, as I- and I think the intelligence- we are not there making any military evaluations, first of all, but, out of the logic of our conversation, it is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all. And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again. This is again- and I'm sorry, fourth time, we have to go back to the table and have a technically sound solution to this. Otherwise, this will come hit us again, in terms of a situation which is not well clarified. And this is an opportunity. We do have an opportunity now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, and we will see if that opportunity is picked up by either side. Director General, thank you for your time today.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Thank you, as always, a pleasure. Thank you very much.",

      "Russian drones struck the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa overnight, killing two people and injuring at least 17, Ukrainian authorities said on Saturday. Meanwhile, three attack helicopters and an anti-aircraft missile system were destroyed in the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Ukraine's Security Service agency deployed special drones to attack the Kirovske military airfield, a Ukrainian security official said on Saturday.",
      "\"Available data indicate the destruction of multi-purpose and attack helicopters Mi-8, Mi-26 and Mi-28, as well as the self-propelled anti-aircraft missile and gun complex Pantsir-S1,\" according to the official, who spoke about the operation on condition of anonymity.",
      "In Odesa, a drone slammed into a residential tower block in the city, causing damage to three floors and trapping residents, emergency services said. The two killed in the attack were a married couple, according to regional Gov. Oleh Kiper, who added that three children were among the injured.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Moscow. According to Russia's Defense Ministry, over 40 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight and on Saturday morning over western Russia and Kremlin-occupied Crimea.",
      "Long-range drone strikes have been a hallmark of the war, now in its fourth year. The race by both sides to develop increasingly sophisticated and deadlier drones has turned the war into a testing ground for new weaponry.",
      "Ukrainian drones have pulled off some stunning feats. At the start of June, nearly a third of Moscow's strategic bomber fleet was destroyed or damaged in a covert Ukrainian operation using cheaply made drones sneaked into Russian territory.",
      "Smaller, short-range drones are used by both sides on the battlefield and in areas close to the roughly 620-mile front line.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said in a report published Thursday that short-range drone attacks killed at least 395 civilians and injured 2,635 between the start of the war in February 2022 and April 2025. Almost 90% of the attacks were by the Russian armed forces, it reported.",
      "More than 13,300 civilians have died and over 34,700 have been injured in the war, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a June 11 report.",

    "summary": "Australian divers descended more than 500 feet underwater in total blackness to explore a ship that sank in 1904 with its whole crew aboard.",
    "story": [
      "Divers in Australia\u00a0completed a historic dive on a century-old shipwreck, exploring the remains of the craft in the \"pitch-black ocean depths\" off the coast of Sydney, a diving organization said on social media.",
      "The Sydney Project Dive Team, a group of trained divers who work to discover and document shipwrecks, conducted the first-ever dive to the SS Nemesis, a craft that sank in 1904 while carrying coal. All 32 people aboard the ship people died in the sinking, the dive team said. The ship sank on a stormy night, according to Australia's New South Wales Environment and Heritage agency. The sinking happened too quickly for lifeboats to be launched, the agency said.",
      "The shipwreck site was only discovered in 2022, the agency said. The wreck lies on the seafloor about 16 miles off the coast of Sydney. A remotely-operated vessel identified the ship as the Nemesis in 2023. But the depth of the wreck made learning more about it difficult. The Nemesis is about 525 feet underwater, the dive team and heritage agency said.",
      "The trip to the wreck was also chronicled in a detailed post by a dive team member.",
      "The mission to the site faced some obstacles. On June 7, the group gathered at 4 a.m. local time to try to dive to the site, but were hindered by stormy weather conditions. On June 18, weather conditions were clearer and allowed for divers to \"attempt one of the deepest technical wreck dives off the Australian coast,\" the dive team said.",
      "There is no light once divers get about 390 feet underwater, the dive team said. That meant the divers traveling to the Nemesis were working in complete blackness, following a line that had been dropped to the wreck. It took two tries to get the line in place and ensure the divers could safely follow it to the wreck.",
      "The divers were able to use lights to illuminate their work. There was crystal-clear visibility, the dive team said. The divers worked in two teams of two to survey the wreck, starting at its \"crushed and crumbled\" bow and traveling to the bridge, filming smoke stacks and other distinctive features. The team had just nine minutes to survey the shipwreck.",
      "There was coal scattered across the wreck site, the dive team said, but no artifacts like plates, cutlery or personal articles were visible. Photos also show fish and other sea life in the area.",
      "The most time-consuming part of the trip was the ascent to the surface, the dive team said. It took the divers six hours to slowly work their way to the surface and decompress safely.",
      "Another mission to the shipwreck site is being planned, the dive team said. That mission will involve completing a scan of the wreck to build on the information gathered by the remote vessel in 2023.",

Rwanda has denied directly backing the rebels. Officials from both countries signed the agreement in Washington this week.",
      "\"So we're here today to celebrate a glorious triumph, and that's what it is, for the cause of peace,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office. \"This is a long time waiting. The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda. The conflict has continued and it's been going on for many, many years. It's been going from, I guess they say 30 years.\"",
      "The region has been unstable for decades, and conflict in eastern Congo has led to thousands of deaths recently, and about 6 million deaths over the last three decades, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The conflict has spawned a humanitarian crisis and widespread displacement in eastern DRC.",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. will be \"putting a lot of pressure\" on the countries to honor the agreement.",
      "\"I will just say that there are big penalties if they violate,\" Mr. Trump said, including financial penalties. But, he added, he thinks they'll remain in peace.",
      "The agreement allows for U.S. access to the DRC's deposits of minerals, such as gold, copper and lithium.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday took credit not just for the DRC-Rwanda agreement, but for his administration's role in intervening in other conflicts, too.",
      "\"This is a tremendous breakthrough,\" he said. \"In a few short months, we've now achieved peace between India and Pakistan, India and Iran, and the DRC and Rwanda, and a couple of others, also.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance also praised the president's role in the DRC-Rwanda deal.",
      "\"If I think about what I know about these two countries, for 30 years, pretty much the entire time that I can remember these two countries being in the news, much of the story has been about them fighting one another, about them killing one another,\" Vance said. \"And now, we can look forward to a future where my children will look at this moment as the beginning of a new story, a story of prosperity and peace.\"",

      "Felipe Orduna-Torres, 32, and Armando Gonzales-Ortega, 55, are to be the first of several defendants sentenced in the San Antonio tragedy, which remains the nation's deadliest human smuggling attempt across the U.S.-Mexico border. In March, a jury deliberated for\u00a0only about an hour before convicting the men of being part of a human smuggling conspiracy that resulted in death and injury.",
      "Orduna-Torres, who\u00a0prosecutors described\u00a0as the leader of the smuggling operation, was given two life sentences and an additional 20 years on a third count to be served consecutively, according to CBS affiliate KENS. Gonzales-Ortega was sentenced to 87.5 years in prison. Prosecutors had described Gonzales-Ortega as Orduna-Torres' top assistant.",
      "Both men were also fined $250,000.",
      "The 64 immigrants inside the truck had come from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and had paid between $12,000 and $15,000 each to be smuggled into the United States, according to an indictment in the case. They had made it as far as the Texas border city of Laredo when they were placed into a\u00a0tractor-trailer with broken air conditioning\u00a0for a three-hour drive to San Antonio.",
      "As the temperature rose inside the trailer, those inside screamed and banged the walls of the trailer for help or tried to claw their way out, investigators said. Most eventually passed out. When the trailer was opened in San Antonio, 48 people were already dead. Another 16 were taken to hospitals, where five more died. The dead included six children and a pregnant woman. Only 11 people inside the vehicle survived.",
      "In a news briefing shortly after the incident, San Antonio police chief William McManus described the scene as \"tragic beyond words.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. State Department announced Thursday that the Trump administration had approved $30 million in funding for the controversial, opaquely run private food distribution organization known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been criticized by a United Nations agency as \"a death trap\" for hungry Palestinians in the war-torn enclave. It is the first U.S. government funding for the GHF confirmed by the Trump administration.",
      "Since it began operating in May, the GHF says it has distributed more than 46 million meals to Gazans, but its record has been marred by almost daily reports of civilians being killed trying to access its four \"distribution hubs.\"",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said that as of Wednesday, 549 people had been killed near GHF hubs trying to access aid, and more than 4,066 others wounded. The United Nations has reported a lower death toll, saying that 410 people have been killed near the aid hubs.",
      "The GHF dismisses the Ministry of Health's figures as disinformation, and it says daily that nobody has been killed inside any of its hubs, while acknowledging incidents of violence outside the sites and referring to Israel's military for further information.",
      "\"We call on other countries to also support the GHF,\" State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said during a media briefing on Thursday, adding that the U.S. support, \"is simply the latest iteration of President Trump's and Secretary Rubio's pursuit of peace in the region.\"",
      "Pigott said he couldn't say whether the U.S. funds had already been handed over to the GHF.",
      "Asked about the pattern of near-daily reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces around GHF distribution hubs, which the Israeli military says it is investigating, Pigott referred the reporter to the IDF to comment on its investigations, and added: \"Many of these reports are based on Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "Given his emphasis on the Trump administration's priority being the provision of more aid in Gaza, Pigott was asked repeatedly whether the U.S. would push Israel to allow other, well established humanitarian organizations to operate more freely inside the strip. He responded to that question multiple times by repeating his call for other countries to support the GHF.",
      "After being pushed by multiple reporters on the accusations that the GHF hubs are \"traps\" for Israeli forces to fire on civilians, Pigott said it was \"important to realize that Hamas bears sole responsibility for this conflict.\"",
      "Other humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies, have refused to work with the GHF, saying it operates in a way that dehumanizes Palestinians by forcing them to venture long distances for food, and citing repeated instances of violence around its distribution sites.",
      "\"Now is the time for unity and collaboration,\" the GHF said Friday. \"We look forward to other aid and humanitarian organizations joining us so we can feed even more Gazans, together.\"",
      "CBS News has requested in-person, on-camera interviews with GHF representatives repeatedly since the organization's creation was announced. GHF has yet to grant an interview.",
      "Criticism of GFH mounts, as it's labelled \"a death trap\" and a \"U.S. proxy\"",
      "The head of the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA,\u00a0called the operation \"a death trap\" in a scathing statement earlier this week.",
      "There were new reports Friday of Palestinians being fired on near a GHF hub in southern Gaza, near the city of Rafah. An amateur video shared online by local Palestinian news organizations \u2014 which CBS News was not immediately able to independently verify \u2014 showed people laying on the ground for cover as bullets can be heard whizzing past. The video was shared with the caption: \"We are besieged by hunger from behind and death from ahead.\"",
      "The international charity Doctors Without Borders added its voice on Friday to the list of non-governmental organizations decrying the GHF,\u00a0calling the group a \"Israeli-U.S. proxy\" and a \"slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid.\"",
      "\"The four distribution sites, all located in areas under the full control of Israeli forces after people had been forcibly displaced from there, are the size of football fields surrounded by watch points, mounds of earth and barbed wire. The fenced entrance gives only one access point in or out,\" MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza, Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, said in the statement. \"If people arrive early and approach the checkpoints, they get shot. If they arrive on time, but there is an overflow and they jump over the mounds and the wires, they get shot. If they arrive late, they shouldn't be there because it is an 'evacuated zone', they get shot.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that MSF has joined the misinformation smear campaign by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry,\" a GHF spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. \"Many of these alleged incidents were falsely linked to GHF sites when in fact they occurred near other humanitarian convoys or distribution locations.\"",
      "The spokesperson did not reply to a CBS News' question about whether the GHF was created or operates in direct conjunction with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Israeli newspaper Haaretz added further weight to the accusations about violence around GHF hubs in an article published Friday, saying it had been told by some anonymous IDF personnel of a deliberate policy to shoot at crowds near GHF distribution sites. One soldier was quoted as saying he had been deployed near a GHF hub, and he described the situation as \"a killing field.\"",
      "\"Where I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day,\" the soldier told Haaretz, which has long been critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. \"They're treated like a hostile force \u2014 no crowd-control measures, no tear gas \u2014 just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Then, once the center opens, the shooting stops, and they know they can approach. Our form of communication is gunfire.\"",
      "\"We strongly reject the accusation raised in the article,\" the IDF told CBS News in a statement on Friday. \"The IDF did not instruct the forces to deliberately shoot at civilians, including those approaching the distribution centers. To be clear, IDF directives prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians.\"",
      "The military said it was \"operating to allow and facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid by the American 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation' (GHF), and to secure the routes leading to the distribution centers, in order to allow the aid to reach the civilians rather than Hamas.\"",
      "The IDF added that its forces were \"conducting systematic learning processes aimed at improving the operational response in the area (around GHF hubs) and minimizing, as much as possible, potential friction between the civilian population and IDF forces. As part of this effort, IDF forces have recently taken steps to reorganize the area, including the installation of new fencing, signage, the opening of additional routes, and more.\"",
      "It said recent reports of civilians being harmed approaching GHF hubs were \"being examined by the relevant IDF authorities\" and that \"any allegation of a deviation from the law or IDF directives will be thoroughly examined, and further action will be taken as necessary.\"",
      "In a joint statement on Friday, Netanyahu and Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz also said the \"State of Israel strongly rejects the despicable blood libels published in the newspaper 'Haaretz.'\"",
      "In response to the Haaretz article, a GHF spokesperson told CBS News on Friday that there had \"been no incidents or fatalities at or in the immediate vicinity of any of our distribution sites. However, IDF is tasked with providing safe passage for aid-seekers to all humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza, including GHF. GHF is not aware of any of these incidents but these allegations are too grave to ignore and we therefore call on Israel to investigate them and transparently publish the results in a timely manner.\"",
      "GHF boss dismisses criticism as \"disinformation\"",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore, an evangelical preacher twice appointed by President Trump as a White House adviser on religious freedoms, told Britain's Sky News on Friday that there was a \"disinformation campaign\" that is \"meant to shut down our efforts\" in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Hamas is intentionally harming people for the purpose of defaming what we're doing,\" he said, adding that the \"U.S. endorsement of the effort is Exhibit A that it is actually working, despite the disinformation campaign that is very, very deliberate, meant to shut down our efforts.\"",
      "Moore suggested that violence could not be avoided around its hubs in Gaza, as the small, densely populated Palestinian territory remains an active warzone.",
      "Sky cited a U.N. figure of 410 people killed near aid hubs in Gaza, slightly lower than the figure provided by the health ministry.",
      "In a social media post after his interview with Sky, Moore said that \"some associated with the UN (& others) are knowingly sharing info that cannot be independently verified, & they're doing so solely for political purposes\u2026 while claiming impartiality. GHF is not political. It just has one mission: feed Gaza.\"",
      "\"The key piece of disinformation is, every single day, some figure comes out from the Gaza Health Ministry. It's normally shared with a network like Al-Jazeera, and it sort of like, goes around the world,\" he told Sky, when asked specifically what disinformation he was referring to.",
      "Moore drew a distinction between the GHF's operations and those of the Israel military.",
      "\"The difference between, you know, what happens when the IDF is involved in an incident \u2014 and we're not denying that there have been those incidents, there have been those incidents \u2014 but we're able to talk to the IDF, the IDF does an investigation, and the IDF is a professionalized military,\" Moore said. \"Hamas is intentionally harming people for the purpose of defaming what we're doing.\"",
      "The IDF has issued repeated statements after reports of troops firing on unarmed Palestinian civilians seeking aid, saying it has launched investigations. The results of any investigations related to incidents near GHF hubs have yet to be made public by the IDF.",
      "\"They go to get food, but end up being killed.\"",
      "A number of Palestinians have told CBS News' team in Gaza about experiences of violence near GHF distribution sites.",
      "In early June, the family of Reem Akhras, a mother of eight, told CBS News' team in Gaza at her funeral that she was shot on her way to retrieve an aid parcel from a GHF hub.",
      "\"You went to get us food, Mom,\" Akhras' young daughter cried, sobbing over her body. \"We will never forgive them.\"",
      "\"They go to get food, but end up being killed,\" a man at Gaza's Nasser Hospital \u2014 where many of the injured were taken after an incident near a GHF hub in southern Gaza this week \u2014 told CBS News. \"They come with empty bags, and the American security company along with the Israeli army, they shoot these young men.\"",
      "The man said 30 people were killed on that day trying to reach the GHF hub.",
      "\"I tell everybody: Don't go. I send a message to all those young men: Do not go. Families should not send their children. Those who go will die. It's a trap. Stop going there. And if your son insists on going, break his legs. Do not go there.\"",
      "Another man at the hospital told CBS News that people have died \"in every family. They were just going to get food. They are hungry, grieving. They've got nothing to eat. Nothing to drink. There's no life. No safety. There's none of that in Gaza.\"",
      "The man said he wished the rest of the world could understand the suffering of people in Gaza.",
      "\"Young men in their prime are dying. What brings these youngsters to go to the aid sites? It's hunger. The fire of hunger has ravaged the people.\"",
      "GHF declines to reveal other backers",
      "Asked why the GHF was not being more transparent about its funding, organization and management, Moore declined to give further information about those matters, instead noting the group's daily press release to news organizations that lists the number of meals it says it has distributed and other \"operations on the ground.\"",
      "The GHF has been surrounded by controversy from the moment it commenced operations in mid-May. Just days after it launched its operation in Gaza, the group's first executive director, American Jake Wood,\u00a0announced his resignation, saying it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. GHF then said it was winding down its operation in Switzerland after Swiss authorities said it was breaching rules for foundations registered in that country.",
      "GHF told CBS News at the time that henceforth, its only operations would be based out of the United States.",
      "\"We're saying everything we can, every single day, and by the way, we promise to do more of that,\" Moore said on Friday when pressed by Sky News about where the organization's funding comes from and what other entities it works with directly. \"One of the reasons we haven't released some pieces of information is because of this amazing, amazing opposition to any effort whatsoever to do this differently.\"",
      "Moore repeated the GHF's insistence that only its method of aid distribution in Gaza was viable, as the only other way meant that \"virtually every piece of aid that comes into the Gaza Strip is immediately taken by armed gangs, by Hamas.\"",
      "Other aid agencies, and officials in the Hamas-run enclave, acknowledge that looting does happen, but they refute claims of large-scale aid theft or diversion, saying the primary challenge to distributing food in Gaza is Israeli forces not permitting those operations.",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 Israel said it carried out more strikes on Iran on Monday, targeting missile, satellite and radar sites two days after President Trump ordered American warplanes to join Israel in attacking the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities, fueling concern around the world of an escalating conflict in the heart of the Middle East with the potential to draw in major world powers.",
      "Those concerns may continue to mount, as both Mr. Trump and Israeli officials hint at hopes that the military operations could result in the fall of Iran's theocratic rulers, and as Iran's top diplomat visits Russia looking for support from a key ally. Israel is also expanding its list of targets in Iran to hit sites linked directly to the ruling theocracy's grip on power domestically.",
      "The office of Israel's defense minister said Monday that the military was \"attacking with unprecedented force regime targets and government repression entities in the heart of Iran.\" It was the first time Israel has acknowledged striking targets linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, rather than its military or nuclear assets.",
      "The defense minister's office said the new targets included the notorious Evin Prison, where political prisoners are held, a clock in Tehran's Palestine Square that symbolically displays a countdown to the destruction of the state of Israel, and the headquarters of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces, which among other things acts as a morality police force for the Islamic rulers.",
      "\"For every shot fired at the Israeli home front, the Iranian dictator will be punished and the attacks will continue with full force,\" the defense minister's office said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said earlier Monday that Israeli warplanes had also struck six airports in Iran, \"as part of the effort to expand air superiority over Iranian skies,\" targeting runways, various aircraft and underground hangers.",
      "Iran also launched a new wave of missiles at Israel on Monday, sending people to bomb shelters across the country. Dozens of missiles were reportedly launched at Israel, with impacts in at least two sites in the northern port city of Haifa and on a road in the southern city of Ashdod.",
      "Israel Electric Corporation said that, following a strike near one of its strategic facilities in southern Israel, there was disruption in the supply of electricity to a number of communities in the area.",
      "The attacks came after U.S. B2 bombers attacked three of Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend \u2013 the first direct U.S. military action against Iran after a week of Israeli attacks.",
      "Iranian nuclear sites \"totally obliterated\" by U.S. strikes?",
      "President Trump said in a televised address on Sunday that Iran's highly fortified Fordo nuclear enrichment site, along with the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities, had been \"completely and totally obliterated\" by the U.S. strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, said during a news conference, noting that a full assessment of the damage would take time.",
      "But while Mr. Trump said in a social media post that the \"spectacular military success\" in Iran had taken \"the 'bomb' right out of their hands,\" The New York Times reported that the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, believed Iran could have moved at least some of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to another location before the U.S. attack, as Iranian officials have claimed.",
      "In remarks to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi did not mention that prospect specifically, but he said \"no one \u2014 including the IAEA \u2014 is in a position to assess the underground damage\" at\u00a0Iran's most sensitive site at Fordo, where the regime is believed to have carried out advanced enrichment work in secret.",
      "\"We must return to the negotiating table and allow the IAEA inspectors, the guardians of the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty], to go back to Iran's nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%,\" Grossi said, referring to the bulk of Iran's highly-enriched uranium, previously known to have been stored at the Isfahan facility. Uranium enriched to that level is only a short technical step away from the 90% purity required to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy. If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi warned the delegations at the U.N.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" it would take days to confirm whether Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved, but he thought it was unlikely.",
      "\"No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it, because you really can't move anything right now. They can't move anything right now inside Iran. The minute a truck starts driving anywhere the Israelis have seen it, and targeted it and taken it out. So our assessment is, we have to assume that \u2014 that's a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there at Isfahan. And that really is key. What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. Multiple countries in the world will take it and down-blend it. That's what they should do with that,\" Rubio said, adding another call for Iran to agree to abandon its enrichment work to end the crisis.",
      "Rubio said if Iran were to \"call right now, and say 'we wanna meet, let's talk about this,' we're prepared to do that. The president's made that clear from the very beginning. His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically.\"",
      "Trump hints at prospect of regime change in Iran",
      "Rubio also reiterated on Sunday President Trump's previous statements that the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites were carried out with the sole purpose of removing the threat of the regime obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"It was not attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move,\" Rubio said.",
      "Mr. Trump had, right after the U.S. strikes, said they would be the extent of America's involvement in the conflict unless Iran launched retaliatory attacks against U.S. assets in the region. But late on Sunday, in a social media post, Mr. Trump stoked concern about a possible further escalation of the conflict.",
      "\"If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked about the president's remarks on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking: If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks \u2014 we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know \u2014 but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night. But as far as far as our military posture, it has not been changed.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his top aids have also suggested in recent days that the military action taken by Israel could make room for an uprising in the Islamic Republic to topple Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime, and Netanyahu has called directly on Iranians to take to the streets.",

      "\"So, we really need very sharp images,\" Urbach said.",
      "The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, \"really far away ... means they come from earlier times.\"",
      "The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter \u2014 a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies.",

      "Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams discusses closing arguments in Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial on \u2018America Reports.\u2019",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' defense team gave closing arguments Friday as the seventh week of the rapper's sex trafficking and racketeering trial came to a close.",
      "As Diddy's defense attorney, Marc Agnifilo, ended his closing argument, he pointed the jury to the quality of the evidence shown by the prosecution. \"That matters,\" he explained.",
      "\"I think the evidence shows that the government targets Sean Combs,\" he added. Agnifilo also said, \"The Cassie lawsuit comes out and these guys went and wanted to make a case because it\u2019s Sean Combs.\"",
      "The prosecution objected to the targeting argument and Judge Arun Subramanian agreed to instruct the jury to disregard it.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs sits in court during closing arguments in his sex trafficking and racketeering case. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Agnifilo ended his closing arguments by insisting that Diddy is innocent. He noted that it takes courage for a juror to acquit. \"Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "During the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said that Diddy thought \"he was untouchable.\"",
      "\"For 20 years, the defendant got away with his crimes\u2026 that ends in this courtroom\u2026the defendant is not a God,\" she said. Comey ended by telling the jury, \"It is time to hold him accountable. Find him guilty.\"",
      "At the start of the defense's closing argument, Diddy's attorney accused the prosecution of bringing a \"fake trial\" against the \"Last Night\" rapper as the government went after his \"private sex life.\"",
      "Diddy's defense claimed none of the prosecution witnesses testified to engaging in racketeering. Agnifilo pointed out the disgraced music mogul's former employees all described working for him as hard, but also said it was like \"going to Harvard Business School.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s the fake trial I\u2019m talking about,\" Agnifilo told the jurors, claiming the prosecution failed to prove the government's theory of racketeering.",
      "Diddy's defense began closing arguments Friday. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Agnifilo then brought up the raids on Diddy's homes, pointing out the seizure of Astroglide and baby oil. There was nothing about the rapper's businesses to make this a criminal case, the defense attorney stated.",
      "\"Where is the crime scene?\u00a0The crime scene is your private sex life,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "According to Diddy's defense, this case was about money. He noted the investigation into Diddy came about after his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, sued the rapper for $30 million. Agnifilo claimed Cassie wouldn't have sued if Diddy didn't have millions. \"We're here because of money,\" he stated to the jury.",
      "Agnifilo claimed what happened between Diddy and Cassie was domestic violence, not sex trafficking. \"Owning the domestic violence, we own it,\" he said in court. \"That\u2019s not charged.\"\u00a0According to the defense attorney, Diddy did not do the things he\u2019s charged with.\u00a0The rapper didn't commit racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, Agnifilo argued. He also claimed the disgraced music mogul didn\u2019t obstruct justice or commit bribery.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs spoke with his lawyers on the 17th day of testimony in his federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Ahead of closing arguments, Diddy walked into the courtroom wearing a beige sweater.\u00a0He gave a small wave, did a thumbs ups and made a heart motion with his hands.\u00a0The rapper then hugged Agnifilo, before sitting down.",
      "There was a short delay in the start of court due to a transportation issue with one juror. While waiting for the jury, Diddy made a prayer gesture with his hands.\u00a0A few of his lawyers made the gesture back to him.",

      "For their closing arguments, Diddy's defense team allegedly planned to invoke the Iran conflict during closing arguments, according to TMZ. The government seemingly objected to this strategy after court Tuesday.",
      "\"Given that the attorneys who will be giving summations won't be here tomorrow, I wanted to put something on the record that I hope will not be necessary, but my hope is that we don't have to object during defense summation,\" Comey said. \"I really don't want to do that. So I just wanted to put on the record that we think it would be objectionable and crossing a line for any summation to bring up politics or current events or the propriety of this prosecution and the use of government resources. I would hope that Mr. Agnifilo would not cross over those lines, but I just wanted to say that if he did, I would object in the middle of his summation and ask the Court to instruct the jury to disregard any comments like that. So I just wanted to state that in advance of summations and the hope that it's not necessary.\"",

      "The prosecution noted this issue had been brought up in one of the government's motions in limine.",
      "\"I believe at that time there was an agreement by the defense not to engage in any of that type of argument,\" Judge Arun Subramanian said. \"But, Mr. Agnifilo, anything to worry about here?\"",

      "The government emphasized in their argument that Diddy ran the alleged criminal enterprise with full control. The prosecution pointed out that the jury heard testimony, saw texts, viewed bank records and heard audio showing the \"Last Night\" rapper committing crime after crime for decades. According to the prosecution, the government showed Diddy didn\u2019t take no for an answer. Up until today, Diddy was able to get away with crime because of money and power,\u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Slavik said. \"That stops now.\"",

      "Closing arguments in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial began Thursday, more than seven weeks after jurors were seated for the case. While the Bad Boy Records founder was the focus of the government's charges, his former chief of staff, Kristina (KK) Khorram, was brought up throughout witnesses' testimony, though she never testified nor was charged.",
      "KK was previously compared to Jeffrey Epstein's righthand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, in a lawsuit brought against her and Diddy in March 2024. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones claimed he witnessed KK ordering sex workers for Diddy. KK also had all the assistants keep drugs ready for Diddy at a moment's notice, according to Jones' allegations.",
      "\"From what we\u2019ve seen so far, the comparison between Kristina Khorram and Ghislaine Maxwell isn\u2019t really a fair one, given that Epstein\u2019s victims were underage girls,\" John J. Perlstein explained to Fox News Digital. \"Still, Khorram is an alleged co-conspirator in the Diddy case, so it makes sense that she wouldn\u2019t want to testify, as she would\u2019ve likely had to plead the Fifth.\"",
      "DIDDY BLOWS KISS TO FAMILY AFTER PROSECUTION PROMISES TO PUT A STOP TO HIS ALLEGED CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR",

      "\"While Ghislaine Maxwell was not originally charged in the Jeffrey Epstein case, charges were eventually filed against her,\" the Los Angeles-based litigator added. \"That\u2019s likely what we see happening here with Khorram and the Diddy case. However, the criminal enterprise case against Diddy is extremely weak, and it\u2019s possible that the case against Khorram would be even weaker.\"",
      "During Diddy's sex trafficking and racketeering trial, prosecutors claimed the music mogul was the leader of the alleged criminal enterprise. His inner circle included his chief of staff, assistants and security.\u00a0Diddy's ex-girlfriend, Jane, testified KK was the rapper's \"righthand woman.\" The government claimed KK lived in Diddy's home in Miami and knew what he was doing all the time. She even allegedly responded to people from his phones.",
      "According to the prosecution, Diddy and his staff were involved in purchasing and distributing drugs. Jane testified that KK helped her transport drugs across state lines. KK was seemingly aware Diddy's assistants were purchasing drugs for the rapper. In texts shown during Brendan Paul's testimony, he asked KK for reimbursement.",
      "Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly procured underage victims for Jeffrey Epstein. (Patrick McMullan)",

      "\"You never call a witness or ask a question that you don't know,\" Becker, who worked on R. Kelly's case, told Fox News Digital. \"So, in this case, if no one was able to actually have these deep conversations with KK and know exactly what she was going to testify to, she could have actually been a thorn in the government's side.\"",

Now, the question becomes, 'Well, if KK is the one who was responsible for some of the very criminal activities that they're now putting on P. Diddy, why isn't she charged with the same types of crimes?'",
      "\"From a legal strategy standpoint, the big fish is who you go after,\" Becker added. \"Who's the big fish that the public knows? Who is the hip-hop mogul that we all know of? Well, it's not KK. Who is it? It's the face. And so the government wants to be firm that the face of the enterprise is the individual who gets in trouble.\"",

      "\"P.

      "After court ended, Diddy sat in the courtroom with his arm on the back of his chair. He casually chatted with his attorneys. A few minutes later, he stood up, faced his family and appeared to be speaking with them. Diddy blew them a kiss and one of his daughters blew one back.",

      "The government emphasized Diddy ran the alleged criminal enterprise with full control. The prosecution pointed out that the jury heard testimony, saw texts, viewed bank records and heard audio showing the \"Last Night\" rapper committing crime after crime for decades.

      "A new study from the University of Florida found that BMI \u2014 a measurement that is commonly used to determine whether a person\u2019s weight is in a healthy range for their height \u2014 is \"deeply flawed\" in terms of predicting mortality.",
      "Instead, one\u2019s level of body fat is \"far more accurate,\" concluded the study, which was published this week in the Annals of Family Medicine.",
      "BMI IS WRONG WAY TO MEASURE OBESITY, RESEARCHERS SAY",
      "To measure participants\u2019 body fat, the researchers used a method called bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which uses a device to measure the resistance of body tissue to a small electrical current.",
      "Over a 15-year period, those who had high body fat were found to be 78% more likely to die in that timeframe than those who had healthy body fat levels, researchers found.",
      "Body mass index (BMI) may not be the most accurate predictor of death risk, researchers say. (iStock)",
      "They were also more than three times as likely to die of heart disease, the study noted.",
      "BMI \u2014 which is calculated by dividing weight by height, squared \u2014 was described as \"entirely unreliable\" in predicting the risk of death over a 15-year period from any cause.",

      "\"One of the routine measures we take alongside traditional vital signs is BMI. We use BMI to screen for a person having an issue with their body composition, but it\u2019s not as accurate for everyone as vital signs are,\" he added.",
      "BMI has been the international standard for measuring obesity since the 1980s, according to many sources, though some experts have questioned its validity.",
      "\"I think the study shows it\u2019s time to go to an alternative that is now proven to be far better at the job.\"",
      "An individual is considered obese if their BMI is 30 or above, overweight if it is between 25 and 29.9, of \"normal\" weight in the range of 18.5 to 24.9, or underweight if lower than 18.5.",
      "While BMI is easy to calculate, one of its main limitations is that it cannot distinguish between muscle and fat mass, the researchers noted.",
      "\"People who are bodybuilders can really elevate their body mass index,\" one doctor said. \"But they\u2019re healthy even with a BMI indicating that they\u2019re obese.\" (iStock)",

      "EXPERIMENTAL DRUG HELPS PATIENTS LOSE NEARLY A QUARTER OF BODY WEIGHT IN EARLY TRIALS",
      "Other methods, such as a DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan, may be even more accurate than BIA, but are much more expensive and not as accessible, the researchers noted.",
      "\"If you talk to obesity researchers, they\u2019re going to say you have to use the DEXA scan because it\u2019s the most accurate,\" Mainous said in the release. \"And that\u2019s probably true. But it\u2019s never going to be viable in a doctor\u2019s office or family practice.\"",
      "\"It has been an easy measurement tool that helps us understand at-risk groups across various populations and demographics, but it doesn't provide accurate data from patient to patient,\" a doctor said of BMI. (iStock)",

      "Potential limitations",
      "\"The main strengths of this study are a better correlation to an individual's risk of morbidity and mortality \u2014 however, the limitations lie in the fact that we don't have enough data to determine the right cutoff for these numbers, or to identify the right tools that will be both accurate and precise across the population,\" Vogel said.",

It takes aim at President Donald Trump's January executive order that redefines who qualifies for U.S. citizenship at birth.",
      "While the justices' 6-3 ruling leaves open the question of how the ruling will apply to the birthright citizenship order at the heart of the case, Friday's lawsuit accuses the administration of violating the Constitution by denying citizenship to children born on U.S. soil if their mothers are either unlawfully present or temporarily in the country and their fathers are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.",

      "Episource claims there\u2019s no evidence the information has been misused, but because they haven\u2019t seen the fallout yet doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening. Once data like this is out, it spreads fast, and the consequences don\u2019t wait for official confirmation.",

      "OVER 8 MILLION PATIENT RECORDS LEAKED IN HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH",
      "Why healthcare SaaS is a growing target",
      "The healthcare industry has embraced cloud-based services to improve efficiency, scale operations and reduce overhead. Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",
      "Episource is not alone in facing this kind of attack. In the past few years, several healthcare SaaS providers have faced breaches, including Accellion and Blackbaud. These incidents have affected millions of patients and have led to class-action lawsuits and stricter government scrutiny.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from healthcare data breach",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "Most phishing scams try (and fail) to impersonate big companies. You\u2019ve probably seen the classics: weird grammar, suspicious email addresses, Microsoft spelled with a \"k\". They\u2019re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:",
      "Exploiting real features:\u00a0Scammers abuse PayPal\u2019s \"add address\" or \"money request\" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal\u2019s real domain. And this works even if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account.",
      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",
      "Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.",
      "Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to \"secure your account\", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials.",

      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it\u2019s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.",

      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",
      "Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.",

      "4. Check your account manually: If you\u2019re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review\u00a0recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.",
      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6.

      "Governor Hochul didn't mince words at her press conference. She made it clear that if New York wants to keep fossil fuels in check and meet its climate goals, nuclear energy has to be part of the mix. The new plant is expected to generate at least one gigawatt of electricity, which is enough to power about a million homes. That's a big deal for a state that's been working hard to cut carbon emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources.",
      "Right now, the New York Power Authority is in the driver's seat, tasked with figuring out where the plant will go and what it will look like. The project is still in its early days, but the state plans to work with private companies to build and operate the facility.

There's a lot of hope that new designs, like small modular reactors, could make things faster and cheaper, but those technologies haven't been proven at scale just yet.",
      "Gov. Hochul pointed out that a lot of the hurdles are at the federal level. Getting the necessary permits and approvals can take years, and the process is anything but simple.

All I needed to do was send him an Apple Gift Card for $200. So I did. Well, $800 later, he wanted more to pay for the broken-down truck that was on its way to my house to deliver my winnings.\"",

      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account.

But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts.

The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins.

      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

      "And if you want proof of how poorly your data is treated, a newly uncovered database offers a stark reminder.

      "What you need to know about the 16 billion password data breach affecting Google, Apple and Facebook",
      "Cybernews describes the exposed database as a \"blueprint for mass exploitation.\" The records include login credentials from popular platforms like Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",
      "BleepingComputer, a cybersecurity site that reviewed the archive, confirmed the data appears to be aggregated from older breaches rather than a fresh incident. This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",
      "Credential stuffing becomes much easier when attackers have access to such a vast pool of usernames and passwords. This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials. So, even if your account wasn't part of a recent breach, you could still be at risk if your old credentials are part of this newly indexed compilation.",

They also suggest using tools like\u00a0Google Password Manager, which securely stores your passwords and notifies you when they\u2019ve been involved in a breach, allowing you to take immediate action.",

      "With credential leaks becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Infostealer malware often targets passwords saved directly in web browsers, making them easy targets. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Passwords are no longer enough. That is why I have always believed tech companies should phase them out entirely and require two-factor authentication across the board. Passwords, once the foundation of online identity, are now one of its weakest links. Companies like Google and Meta are already building systems that move beyond them. The tools are available.

      "How BeBot works: Tech specs and core features",
      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

Millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans each year, harming hundreds of species, including nearly half of all marine animals. BeBot's gentle cleaning process reduces these threats without disturbing sensitive habitats or compressing turtle eggs. Cleaner beaches lead to healthier ecosystems and better experiences for visitors. Because BeBot operates quietly and efficiently, it is ideal for popular tourist destinations where traditional machinery would be disruptive or damaging. The robot also sparks important conversations about pollution and inspires communities to take action, complementing human-led cleanups by targeting the small plastics that often go unnoticed.",

    "story": [
      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Even experienced users can be tricked when malicious behavior is disguised as routine. The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves. Mac users, like everyone else, need to treat every familiar-looking interface with a little more skepticism. Especially when it asks for your password.",

      "Why Plus is grabbing attention in the trucking world",
      "Trucking is a $2 trillion freight market in the U.S. and Europe alone, and it faces some serious headwinds. There is a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs, and relentless demand for faster deliveries. Plus's SuperDrive software is designed to address these pain points by enabling safe, scalable autonomous trucking. The technology is not just theoretical. It has already been tested over five million miles across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, gathering real-world data to make its AI smarter and more reliable with every trip.",
      "Founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 by engineers and entrepreneurs with deep roots in AI and machine learning, Plus has always aimed to do things differently. Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, Plus uses advanced AI models to create a \"driving intelligence\" that learns and adapts from every mile on the road. This AV 2.0 approach helped Plus achieve a major safety milestone in April 2025, when its SuperDrive system successfully completed \"driver-out\" validation. The truck operated autonomously without a human behind the wheel. Plus is currently running public road tests in Texas and Sweden, with more fleet trials coming soon.",

Plus is entering the public market with a pre-money valuation of $1.2 billion, offering an attractive opportunity for investors interested in the next wave of AI-driven logistics.",
      "What sets Plus apart financially is its capital-light, software-focused model. Instead of building trucks from scratch, Plus provides the AI \"brain\" that powers them, generating recurring revenue through a driver-as-a-service approach. This means high margins, scalable growth, and a clear path to profitability. The company is led by a team of experienced founders and executives, including CEO David Liu, who has a proven track record of building and scaling technology startups. Liu underscores the company\u2019s broader mission, stating:",

      "Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest obstacles. Fully autonomous, driver-out operations like\u00a0Plus is testing raise complex questions about safety, liability, and insurance. Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.",
      "Labor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:",
      "\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"",
      "This quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.",
      "Even within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.",
      "In response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.",

      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.",

      "The introduction of advanced humanoid robots like Kepler's K2 naturally raises questions about the future of human employment in manufacturing and other industries. It's true that automation and robotics have the potential to change the way work is organized on the factory floor. Some worry that robots could replace jobs traditionally held by people, especially in roles that involve repetitive or physically demanding tasks.",
      "However, experts and industry leaders point out that the story is more nuanced. While certain jobs may be automated, new opportunities often emerge alongside technological advancements. For example, the rise of robotics is expected to create roles in robot maintenance, programming, AI training, and oversight, jobs that require different skills but are essential to supporting and managing these new systems. Many analysts believe that robots like the K2 are likely to complement human workers by taking over monotonous or hazardous duties, which allows people to focus on more complex, creative, or supervisory tasks.",
      "Collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" are specifically designed to work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety rather than simply replacing labor. This collaborative approach can lead to new forms of teamwork and innovation on the factory floor, making work environments safer and more efficient. Ultimately, the integration of humanoid robots is expected to shift the workforce rather than eliminate it, opening up new possibilities for both businesses and employees as they adapt to a more automated future.",

      "Elon Musk launched a series of attacks on Saturday against a massive spending bill that would fund much of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, renewing his criticisms as Senate Republicans rush to pass a package dubbed the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d in order to meet a July 4 deadline set by Trump.",
      "\u201cThe latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X. \u201cUtterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\u201d",
      "The billionaire and former Trump adviser amplified a poll that suggests the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d is politically unpopular due to its budgetary effects, a notion that was affirmed this month by several separate surveys. Forty percent of Republican respondents to a recent NBC News Decision Desk poll said \u201censuring the national debt is reduced\u201d is the most important issue as Congress considers the Trump-backed megabill. Overall, a majority of respondents said maintaining current spending levels on programs like Medicaid is the most important issue.",
      "\u201cPolls show that this bill is political suicide for the Republican Party,\u201d Musk wrote on X.",
      "Musk has long been a critic of Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d balking at its expected impact on the national deficit and arguing that it would offset government savings brought in by the Department of Government Efficiency, an office Trump appointed him to lead earlier this year. He maintained that opinion Saturday, expressing it through several posts on his platform, X \u2014 including one post that attacked the bill\u2019s expected effect on the deficit as \u201cputting America in the fast lane to debt slavery!\u201d",
      "Trump previously argued that Musk only opposed the legislation because of provisions aimed at stripping away electric vehicle tax credits. Musk today called a provision in the bill that he framed as targeting clean energy production \u201cincredibly destructive to America.\u201d",
      "The Tesla chief\u2019s departure from the White House, where he formally served as a special government employee, came a day after he publicly expressed his criticisms of the bill during an interview with \u201cCBS Sunday Morning.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, I don\u2019t know if it can be both,\u201d Musk said at the time.",
      "While Musk no longer commands similar levels of influence in Washington, his past opposition to the bill emboldened Republicans lawmakers, some of whom, like Musk, took issue with its expected $4 trillion increase to the national deficit.",
      "The renewed criticism by Musk comes as Senate Republicans rush to whip enough votes to pass the 940-page megabill amid breaks in the party over certain provisions, including expected cuts to Medicaid that could strip funding from rural hospitals. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., cited the loss of rural hospital funding in explaining his decision to oppose the bill.",
      "Earlier this month, shortly after the House of Representatives passed its version of the bill, Musk urged his more than 200 million followers on X to tell Congress to \u201ckill the bill.\u201d"

      "Hundreds of thousands of community college students are at risk of losing financial assistance under the proposed \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill,\u201d which would tighten eligibility requirements for Pell Grants.",
      "Students would be required to enroll full time to maintain eligibility for the federally subsidized grants that serve as a financial lifeline for many low- to middle-income students.",
      "The bill would increase the number of credit hours students must take each semester from 12 to 15 and could strain those who work, parent, suffer financial distress or otherwise find it difficult to increase their course loads, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.",
      "More than 10 million people are enrolled in community colleges across the United States. Students who attend four-year colleges can also apply for Pell Grants, but community colleges are often a gateway into the higher education pipeline for low- to middle-income students.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d said Lakina Mabins, 41, a mother of five who worked two jobs before becoming valedictorian last month at Kennedy King College in Chicago. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take out a loan if I wanted to because you have to have good credit.\u201d",
      "Students can receive between $740 and $7,395 a year from the Pell Grant program, according to the the American Association of Community Colleges.",
      "It costs $4,050 a year on average to attend a community college, while the average four-year, in-state tuition at a public university is $11,610 a year, the association said.",
      "Tighter restrictions for Pell Grant eligibility are part of a sweeping congressional budget bill advanced by Republicans and aimed at cutting taxes and government spending.",
      "House Republicans approved their version of the bill in May, and it\u2019s now being considered by the Senate.",
      "Student Maria Baez, who attends the Community College of Philadelphia, said she would likely have to drop out of school if the bill becomes law because she would not be able to afford it.",
      "She said she received about $3,600 through the Pell Grant program last semester.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even have a backup plan,\u201d said Baez, 41, who wants to own a small marketing business one day. \u201cBut I want so badly to further my education so that I can have a career.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of thousands of students could be at risk of losing their grants if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is approved, said Martha Parham, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Community Colleges.",
      "Many students are unable to attend college full time because they have other responsibilities, she said.",
      "\u201cCommunity colleges are the on-ramp to the middle class,\u201d Parham said, but costs can pose a strong barrier.",
      "The first grants were awarded in 1973; the program was later named for the late Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.",
      "The Big Beautiful Bill would also do away with subsidized federal loans, which would force college borrowers to accumulate more debt.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely hard for people to get out of debt with these changes,\u201d Astra Taylor, co-founder of the Debt Collective, an organization that helps people fight debt, told CNBC.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is playing a key role in drafting the Senate\u2019s version of the bill, was unavailable for comment this week, his office said.",
      "Cassidy has said the entire Big Beautiful Bill would save an estimated $300 billion in government spending and lift the burden on taxpayers who subsidize college graduates\u2019 loan payments.",
      "But student Michael Weaver, 34, who attends Stanly Community College in Albemarle, North Carolina, on a Pell Grant, said part of the appeal of attending a two-year college is to take courses at your own pace.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a stretch for most students, and to be honest, the majority of students receiving the grant are working people who only have the option of attending school part time,\u201d Weaver said.",
      "Mabins, who plans to attend National Louis University in downtown Chicago this fall, considers herself a low-income student because she lives in public housing and is enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.",
      "\u201cThe government wants me off assistance, but they are creating more debt and making it harder for me to better myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI have goals, and in the next five years, I see myself with a master\u2019s degree and working in my career field.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Yemeni island of Socotra was largely unspoiled, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense. Now it is threatened by climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For months while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Badar Khan Suri, the Georgetown University postdoctoral scholar who was targeted for deportation by the Trump administration, said he spun a tale for his 5-year-old sons to help them cope with his absence.",
      "\u201cFor my younger twins, I created a story they could hold on to: I told them I was traveling and had gotten lost somewhere in the clouds, trying to find my way back home,\u201d Khan Suri said in an email to NBC News.",
      "It was one of the ways, Khan Suri said, that he attempted to continue to parent his three children \u201cwith love, creativity and resilience\u201d from detention. Now, just over a month since his release from an ICE facility in Texas, Khan Suri reflected on his experience with family separation, one that he said took a significant toll on his wife and children.",
      "Khan Suri credits his wife, Maphaz Ahmad Yousef, with being a critical support system for their children, calling her a \u201cblessing.\u201d However, he\u2019s still processing the pain of separation, he said.",
      "\u201cFor my family also, I feel the power dynamic changed. I am no more the provider or protector I once was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have survivor\u2019s clarity, as I saw the injustice. I am rebuilding my journey with meaning and truth.\u201d",
      "Parenting from detention, he said, \u201cwas one of the most heartbreaking parts of my experience \u2014 but also the one that kept me going.\u201d",
      "These days, Khan Suri \u2014 who was released last month after a judge ruled that his detention violated the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fifth Amendment right to due process \u2014 said his children have been enjoying life with both their parents at home. He said he has returned to some quintessential dad duties including bringing his kids to the bus stop, and he\u2019s earned the privilege of being identified as the favorite parent in the household.",
      "\u201cEven the twins say \u2018Baba\u2019 when I ask who they love more,\u201d he joked. \u201cBefore, it was always a clear \u2018Mama.\u2019\u201d",
      "But three months ago, Khan Suri was pulled away from his family when he was arrested outside his Arlington, Virginia, home and accused by the Department of Homeland Security of \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\u201d He was never formally charged with a crime.",
      "Khan Suri \u201chas close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas,\u201d DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in March on X.",
      "His attorney Hassan Ahmad has repeatedly denied that he ever made pro-Hamas or antisemitic statements. Khan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef, was an adviser to a now-deceased Hamas leader. Yousef said he left his position more than a decade ago and he has since become a critic of Hamas.",
      "Khan Suri described the first week in ICE custody as a \u201cnightmare.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat night, my wife was only able to bring back my belongings. My elder son only saw my bag returning home and not me,\u201d he said of the night of his arrest. \u201cI was sad for my children, who had lost their father, their security cover, their ease in life.\u201d",
      "He had been moved across multiple facilities and three states, finally landing in Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. However, as Khan Suri\u2019s detention stretched on, he said, he aimed to maintain some semblance of lightness for his family. During their occasional phone calls home, Khan Suri said he made sure his youngest children absorbed his tall tale about the clouds.",
      "\u201cWhen I first had the chance to speak with them, I repeated that same story,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would draw pictures for me, and even save cupcakes or slices of pizza for me as if I might come back at any moment \u2014 they refused to let anyone else touch my share.\u201d",
      "While his youngest sons believed he had been journeying through the skies, Khan Suri said his oldest child had picked up on bits and pieces of his situation. And while at the facility, the father said, he had attempted to paint a more positive picture of the conditions he was living in, particularly as his 9-year-old became more withdrawn.",
      "\u201cI tried to bring humor into our conversations when I could,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d tell him I had a PlayStation 4, a basketball court and a soccer field where I was, and he would laugh and ask questions about them.\u201d",
      "According to Khan Suri\u2019s habeas petition, he wasn\u2019t assigned a bed in a dorm when he first arrived at the facility. Instead, he was placed in the detention\u2019s \u201cTV room,\u201d where the television runs every day from 5 a.m. to 2 a.m., according to the petition. Khan Suri had also requested religious accommodations and only received halal food after five days, the documents said.",
      "\u201cOn April 2, officers came and told him that he had complained through his lawyer about his religious accommodations and asked him for more details,\u201d the petition said. \u201cAfter Dr. Khan Suri reaffirmed his needs, he was given a prayer mat, a Quran, and provided a space on a bed in the dorm, outside of the TV room.\u201d",
      "He was also issued a bright-red uniform, usually reserved for individuals classified as requiring high security due to their criminal history, the petition said. When he inquired about the uniform, Khan Suri was told that he fell under the category due to his association \u201cwith a known criminal group \u2014 presumably based on Respondents\u2019 unfounded claims of his connections to Hamas,\u201d the petition said.",
      "\u201cDue to his classification and security protocols at the facility, Dr. Khan Suri is only permitted two hours per week of recreation,\u201d the petition said.",

      "\u201cI would write about them, I would think about them \u2014 like when their school bus would come, when would it return, what they do during the day, what they were drawing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I saw drawings by kids of other detainees, I felt the love for my children.\u201d",
      "After he was released following the judge\u2019s ruling that the government had failed to provide evidence that Khan Suri was a flight risk or a danger to the community, he said the reunion with his children was joyful.",

      "Brian Johnson, known as the \u201cLiver King\u201d online for his raw \u201cancestral-based\u201d diet, made headlines this week for his beef with podcaster Joe Rogan.",
      "Johnson was arrested Tuesday after making a series of threats on Instagram against Rogan, one of the most popular podcasters in the world. Austin, Texas, police arrested Johnson after he traveled to the city where Rogan lives.",
      "\u201cJoe Rogan, I\u2019m calling you out. My name\u2019s Liver King. Man to man, I\u2019m picking a fight with you,\u201d Johnson said in a video he posted Monday. \u201cI have no training in jiu-jitsu; you\u2019re a black belt, you should dismantle me. But I\u2019m picking a fight with you. Your rules. I\u2019ll come to you, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d",
      "Johnson, who has never been a guest on Rogan\u2019s podcast, was charged with making terroristic threats, a Class B misdemeanor.",
      "While Johnson has entered the mainstream since his arrest, his erratic and alternative lifestyle have long fascinated and disgusted followers as he consumed raw meat, including animal testicles.",
      "Who is the \u2018Liver King\u2019?",
      "Johnson, an influencer on YouTube and Instagram, rose to fame for his alternative diet, which he calls an \u201cancestral lifestyle\u201d \u2014 or living in the ways ancient civilizations may have used to survive.",
      "He earned the moniker the \u201cLiver King\u201d because of his diet of raw organs and meat in an attempt to avoid processed food and eat like ancient humans. He also highlighted a strict exercise regimen, to which he once attributed his massive, muscular frame.",
      "Other \u201cancestral\u201d behaviors Johnson engaged in included sleeping on a bed of wooden slats.",
      "Johnson, who is often shirtless and sports a long, scraggly beard, has 1.21 million subscribers on YouTube, 3 million followers on Instagram and 6.1 million followers on TikTok.",
      "It\u2019s not just his physique and his preaching about ancestral living that have captivated audiences, but also the spectacle of watching Johnson consume foods like animal liver, fish and bull testicles. He has also promoted walking barefoot outside and taking ice baths.",
      "Others have tried to emulate Johnson\u2019s lifestyle and purchased his \u201csupplement bar,\u201d which is available on his website. He also offers recipes, and instructions on how to eat like a \u201cLiver King\u201d on his site.",
      "He also owns two companies: Ancestral Supplements and The Fittest.",
      "Johnson\u2019s online presence became so popular, last month Netflix released a documentary called \u201cUNTOLD: The Liver King,\u201d which documents Johnson\u2019s rise to fame and how he built his social media brand.",
      "Controversies and lawsuits",
      "Throughout his time as an influencer, Johnson preached that his muscular physique was attributable to his raw diet and his intense exercise regimen.",
      "In December 2022, Johnson posted a video to YouTube admitting that he had been and was currently using steroids after leaked emails appeared to show he was spending approximately $11,000 a month on the performance-enhancing drugs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been on several podcasts and when asked if I\u2019ve ever taken steroids, I\u2019ve always said, \u2018No. I\u2019ve never touched the stuff. I\u2019m not going to touch the stuff,\u2019\u201d he said in the video. \u201cThat was a lie.\u201d",
      "Following this admission, a $25 million lawsuit was filed against Johnson in the state of New York claiming he promoted his \u201cancestral lifestyle\u201d to elevate his business and sell products. In 2023, a settlement was reached and the lawsuit was dismissed.",
      "However, the revelation that Johnson was using steroids seemed to disillusion some who had attempted to follow his regimen.",
      "So what\u2019s the beef with Rogan?",
      "The simple answer: It\u2019s unclear.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a spokesperson for the Austin Police Department said detectives \u201ccontacted Mr. Rogan, who stated he had never had any interaction with Johnson and considered the posts to be threatening. Based on this information, detectives obtained an arrest warrant for Johnson on a charge of Terroristic Threat.\u201d",
      "Johnson was arrested at a Four Seasons Hotel in Austin. Rogan lives in Texas.",
      "A video showing Johnson being handcuffed and put into a police vehicle was posted to his Instagram account. However, he has since been released from custody."

      "James Walkinshaw won with 59.54% of the vote in Saturday\u2019s party-run primary, according to results posted by the 11th Congressional District Democratic Committee of Virginia. He beat a field of 10 candidates that included state Sen. Stella Pekarsky and state Del. Irene Shin in the race for the special election nomination.",
      "Shin finished in second place with 14.27% of the vote, while Pekarsky placed third with 13.40%, according to the party's tabulation.",
      "Walkinshaw was Connolly\u2019s chief of staff from 2009 to 2019 and has served on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors since 2020. Walkinshaw earned an endorsement from Connolly for this race before he died.",

      "Tillis, who faces re-election next year in a battleground state, was one of two Republicans, along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, to vote against advancing the \"big, beautiful bill\" in the Senate Saturday evening.",
      "\"Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against 'Senator Thom' Tillis,\" Trump wrote Saturday night. \"I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America.\"",
      "Trump' social media criticism came hours after Tillis said in a statement that he \"cannot support this bill in its current form,\" pointing to expected cuts to Medicaid he said would \"result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities.\"",
      "Trump accused the two-term senator of grandstanding \"in order to get some publicity for himself, for a possible, but very difficult re-election.\"",
      "\"Looks like Senator Thom Tillis, as usual, wants to tell the Nation that he\u2019s giving them a 68% Tax Increase, as [he is] opposed to the Biggest Tax Cut in American History!,\" Trump wrote, adding, \"Thom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!\"",
      "Tillis is one of Democrats' top targets for defeat in the 2026 midterm elections. He won his previous two Senate races by fewer than two percentage points.",
      "Prior to Trump\u2019s post, Tillis told reporters Saturday evening that he gave the president a heads up about his opposition during a call he characterized as \"very professional\" and \"very respectful.\"",
      "\u201cI had a very good discussion with President Trump last night. I told him at that point that I had problems with the [Medicaid] implementation. And I said the House bill, I think, would be a good mark,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cI do believe the president is really focused on getting the tax portion of the bill done, and I support that, full stop. But it has evolved from a tax bill to one that includes health care and other things. And I said that in non-tax areas, we have a problem.\u201d",
      "Asked if he was concerned about Trump endorsing a primary challenge to him, Tillis responded, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "Trump has threatened to primary GOP lawmakers critical of him in the past, wielding his influence to unseat Republicans who voted to impeach him after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, including then-Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. Last week, two Trump advisers launched a super PAC aimed at removing Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., another frequent critic of the administration's agenda.",
      "But Trump hasn't always followed through on the threats. For example, he stood down on a threat to back a primary challenger to Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., who endorsed Gov. Ron DeSantis's 2-24 presidential bid."

      "A coalition of groups, ranging from environmental activists to Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands, converged Saturday outside an airstrip in the Florida Everglades  to protest the imminent construction of an immigrant detention center.",
      "Hundreds of protesters lined part of U.S. Highway 41 that slices through the marshy Everglades \u2014 also known as Tamiami Trail \u2014 as dump trucks hauling materials lumbered into the airfield. Cars passing by honked in support as protesters waved signs calling for the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to a few Native tribes and several endangered animal species.",
      "Christopher McVoy, an ecologist, said he saw a steady stream of trucks entering the site while he protested for hours. Environmental degradation was a big reason he came out Saturday. But as a South Florida city commissioner, he said, concerns over immigration raids in his city also fueled his opposition.",
      "\u201cPeople I know are in tears, and I wasn\u2019t far from it,\u201d he said.",
      "Florida officials have forged ahead over the past week in constructing the compound dubbed as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d within the Everglades\u2019 humid swamplands.",
      "The government fast-tracked the project under emergency powers from an executive order issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis that addresses what he views as a crisis of illegal immigration. That order lets the state sidestep certain purchasing laws and is why construction has continued despite objections from Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and local activists.",
      "The facility will have temporary structures like heavy-duty tents and trailers to house detained immigrants. The state estimates that by early July, it will have 5,000 immigration detention beds in operation.",
      "Native American leaders in the region have seen the construction as an encroachment onto their sacred homelands, which prompted Saturday\u2019s protest. In Big Cypress National Preserve, where the airstrip is located, 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, as well as ceremonial and burial grounds and other gathering sites, remain.",
      "Others have raised human rights concerns over what they condemn as the inhumane housing of immigrants. Worries about environmental impacts have also been at the forefront, as groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity and the Friends of the Everglades filed a lawsuit Friday to halt the detention center plans.",
      "\u201cThe Everglades is a vast, interconnected system of waterways and wetlands, and what happens in one area can have damaging impacts downstream,\u201d Friends of the Everglades executive director Eve Samples said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important that we have a clear sense of any wetland impacts happening in the site.\u201d",
      "Bryan Griffin, a DeSantis spokesperson, said Friday in response to the litigation that the facility was a \u201cnecessary staging operation for mass deportations located at a preexisting airport that will have no impact on the surrounding environment.\u201d",
      "Until the site undergoes a comprehensive environmental review and public comment is sought, the environmental groups say, construction should pause. The facility\u2019s speedy establishment is \u201cdamning evidence\u201d that state and federal agencies hope it will be \u201ctoo late\u201d to reverse their actions if they are ordered by a court to do so, said Elise Bennett, a Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney working on the case."

      "Nicknamed \u201cthe Cobra,\u201d the 6-foot-5 Parker made his major league debut in 1973 and played 19 seasons, 11 for the Pirates. He was the NL MVP in 1978, won a World Series with Pittsburgh a year later and then won another championship in 1989 with the Oakland Athletics.",
      "\u201cAll of us who grew up in the '70s remember how special Dave was,\u201d Pirates owner Bob Nutting said in a statement. \u201cHe had a big personality and his passing has left a bigger void for all who knew him. Our hearts go out to his wife, Kellye, and his family.\u201d",
      "Parker won NL batting titles in 1977 and \u201978. He finished his career as a .290 hitter with 339 homers and 1,493 RBIs. He also played for Cincinnati, Milwaukee, the California Angels and Toronto.",
      "Parker was elected to the Hall of Fame by a special committee in December. The induction ceremony in Cooperstown, New York, is set for July 27.",
      "\u201cWe join the baseball family in remembering Dave Parker. His legacy will be one of courage and leadership, matched only by his outstanding accomplishments on the field,\u201d Hall chairman Jane Forbes Clark said. \u201cHis election to the Hall of Fame in December brought great joy to him, his family and all the fans who marveled at his remarkable abilities.\u201d",
      "Born on June 9, 1951, in Grenada, Mississippi, Parker grew up in Cincinnati and was a three-sport star at Courter Tech High School.",
      "After playing for Pittsburgh from 1973 to 1983, he signed with his hometown Reds and spent four seasons with the club. In 1985 he led the NL with 125 RBIs and was second in the MVP voting.",
      "\u201cHe was such a big dude at a time when there weren\u2019t that many \u20186-foot-5, 230-pound, dynamic defender, batting champion with power\u2019 guys,\u201d Hall of Famer and Reds teammate Barry Larkin said. \u201cEverything about him was impressive.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Reds said: \u201cDave was a towering figure on the field, in the clubhouse and in the Cincinnati community, where his baseball journey began, playing on the fields near his home and going to games at Crosley Field. Dave\u2019s impact on the game and this franchise will never be forgotten.\u201d",
      "Parker was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2012.",
      "He told reporters that he burst into tears upon learning of his selection to the Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cYeah, I cried,\u201d Parker said after receiving the news. \u201cIt only took a few minutes, because I don\u2019t cry.\u201d",
      "Parker homered for the A\u2019s in the 1989 World Series opener and took credit for helping the Bash Brothers of Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire take the title with a four-game sweep of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cAll of us throughout the game are deeply saddened by this loss,\u201d baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cWe will remember the Cobra forever, especially as his name soon officially joins the legends of our national pastime.\u201d",
      "Parker was a seven-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove right fielder, and when he retired after the 1991 season, he was one of only five players with at least 500 doubles, 300 homers, 150 stolen bases and 2,700 hits.",
      "\u201cI was a five-tool player. I could do them all,\u201d Parker said after his Hall selection. \u201cI never trotted to first base. I don\u2019t know if people noticed that, but I ran hard on every play.\u201d"

      "Elon Musk launched a series of attacks on Saturday against a massive spending bill that would fund much of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, renewing his criticisms as Senate Republicans rush to pass a package dubbed the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d in order to meet a July 4 deadline set by Trump.",
      "\u201cThe latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X. \u201cUtterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\u201d",
      "The billionaire and former Trump adviser amplified a poll that suggests the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d is politically unpopular due to its budgetary effects, a notion that was affirmed this month by several separate surveys. Forty percent of Republican respondents to a recent NBC News Decision Desk poll said \u201censuring the national debt is reduced\u201d is the most important issue as Congress considers the Trump-backed megabill. Overall, a majority of respondents said maintaining current spending levels on programs like Medicaid is the most important issue.",
      "\u201cPolls show that this bill is political suicide for the Republican Party,\u201d Musk wrote on X.",
      "Musk has long been a critic of Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d balking at its expected impact on the national deficit and arguing that it would offset government savings brought in by the Department of Government Efficiency, an office Trump appointed him to lead earlier this year. He maintained that opinion Saturday, expressing it through several posts on his platform, X \u2014 including one post that attacked the bill\u2019s expected effect on the deficit as \u201cputting America in the fast lane to debt slavery!\u201d",
      "Trump previously argued that Musk only opposed the legislation because of provisions aimed at stripping away electric vehicle tax credits. Musk today called a provision in the bill that he framed as targeting clean energy production \u201cincredibly destructive to America.\u201d",
      "The Tesla chief\u2019s departure from the White House, where he formally served as a special government employee, came a day after he publicly expressed his criticisms of the bill during an interview with \u201cCBS Sunday Morning.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, I don\u2019t know if it can be both,\u201d Musk said at the time.",
      "While Musk no longer commands similar levels of influence in Washington, his past opposition to the bill emboldened Republicans lawmakers, some of whom, like Musk, took issue with its expected $4 trillion increase to the national deficit.",
      "The renewed criticism by Musk comes as Senate Republicans rush to whip enough votes to pass the 940-page megabill amid breaks in the party over certain provisions, including expected cuts to Medicaid that could strip funding from rural hospitals. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., cited the loss of rural hospital funding in explaining his decision to oppose the bill.",
      "Earlier this month, shortly after the House of Representatives passed its version of the bill, Musk urged his more than 200 million followers on X to tell Congress to \u201ckill the bill.\u201d"

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Hungary\u2019s LGBTQ+ community is preparing for a face-off with the country\u2019s autocratic government, and plans to push ahead with a march in the capital on Saturday despite a government ban and threats of legal repercussions.",
      "The populist party of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n in March fast-tracked a law through parliament that made it an offense to hold or attend events that \u201cdepict or promote\u201d homosexuality to minors aged under 18. Orb\u00e1n earlier made clear that Budapest Pride \u2014 marking its 30th anniversary this year \u2014 was the explicit target of the law.",
      "But on Friday, Pride organizers along with Budapest Mayor Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, European Commissioner Hadja Lahbib and Vice President of the European Parliament Nicolae Stefanuta said the march will take place Saturday despite official threats of heavy fines for participants and even jail time for the liberal mayor.",
      "They expect the march to be the largest ever Pride event in Hungary.",
      "\u201cThe government is always fighting against an enemy against which they have to protect Hungarian people ... This time, it is sexual minorities that are the target,\u201d Kar\u00e1csony told a news conference. \u201cWe believe there should be no first and second class citizens, so we decided to stand by this event.\u201d",
      "A crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights",
      "Critics of the Pride ban and other Hungarian legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities say the policies are reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia.",
      "Hungary\u2019s recent law allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend a prohibited event. Being caught could result in fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($586.)",
      "Orb\u00e1n, seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in the European Union, has in recent years prohibited same-sex adoption and banned any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.",
      "His government argues exposure to such content negatively affects children\u2019s development. But opponents say the moves are part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and consolidate his conservative base.",
      "Fines and facial recognition",
      "After police rejected several requests by organizers to register the Pride march, citing the recent law, Kar\u00e1csony joined with organizers and declared it would be held as a separate municipal event \u2014 something he said does not require police approval.",
      "But Hungary\u2019s government has remained firm, insisting that holding the Pride march, even if it is sponsored by the city, would be unlawful. In a video on Facebook this week, Hungary\u2019s justice minister, Bence Tuzson, warned Kar\u00e1csony that organizing Pride or encouraging people to attend is punishable by up to a year in prison.",
      "At the news conference Friday, Kar\u00e1csony sought to dispel fears that police would impose heavy fines on Pride attendees.",
      "\u201cPolice have only one task tomorrow: to guarantee the safety and security of those gathered at the event,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to state radio on Friday, Orb\u00e1n said that attending Pride \u201cwill have legal consequences, but it can\u2019t reach the level of physical abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe police could disperse such events, they have the right to do so. But Hungary is a civilized country,\u201d he said.",
      "Right-wing counter-demonstrations",
      "On Thursday, radical right-wing party Our Homeland Movement announced it had requested police approval to hold assemblies at numerous locations across the city, many of them on the same route as the Pride march.",
      "Later, a neo-Nazi group said it too would gather Saturday at Budapest City Hall, from which the Pride march is set to depart. The group declared that only \u201cwhite, Christian, heterosexual men and women\u201d were welcome to attend its demonstration.",
      "European officials respond",
      "Hungary\u2019s Pride ban has prompted a backlash from many of the country\u2019s partners and allies. Over 30 foreign embassies signed a joint statement this week expressing their commitment to \u201cevery person\u2019s rights to equal treatment and nondiscrimination, freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\u201d",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on social platform X on Wednesday, calling on Hungarian authorities to allow Pride to proceed \u201cwithout fear of any criminal or administrative sanctions against the organizers or participants.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Ticks can be active in any season and it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you\u2019ve been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "How ticks can spread disease",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2014 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn\u2019t always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "How to check for ticks",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\u201d",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "How to keep ticks away",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Protect your pets from ticks",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog\u2019s skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2014 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "What to do after a tick bite",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable."

    "story": [
      "In a world where highly produced social media videos tend to be king, Josie Balka's could be described as visually straightforward by comparison.",
      "Typically wearing leisurewear, the Canadian radio show host looks into a camera in the soundproof studio she created in her basement. With a microphone propped in front of her, she records poems \u2014 ones she's written that cover complicated topics like friendships, broken hearts, body insecurities, aging and grief.",
      "And these poems have now been watched over 100 million times on TikTok alone (yes, we counted).",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t remember anyone I\u2019ve ever seen at a public pool with such a memorable body, good or bad, that I think about it ever again,\u201d begins what is her most popular poem thus far.",
      "In it, she reflects on all the aspects of a person that only briefly grab her attention \u2014 their body, their looks \u2014 before pivoting to what she does remember.",
      "\u201cWhen I talk about my friends, sometimes I will bother to note that they are beautiful, yes. But I will list the things that make them that way,\u201d she says.",
      "What began as a regulation exercise from her therapist has turned Balka into a viral sensation in late 20223, with the likes of John Mayer, Jennifer Aniston and Mel Robbins sharing her work. And now, with the release of her first book, \"I Hope You Remember,\" Balka can add New York Times bestselling author to her list of accolades. (Her second book, \"Loves of Our Lives,\" will be out January 2026.)",
      "\"It's hard to wrap my head around,\" she tells TODAY.com on the phone as she sat on her porch earlier this month. \"It just doesn't feel real.\"",
      "Balka spoke with TODAY.com about her sudden viral rise, how quickly she can whip up a poem, the themes to which she keeps returning and whether her fianc\u00e9 is terrified about writing his own wedding vows (spoiler alert: he is).",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "The one thing that I worry about the most is the people that I know thinking that it\u2019s not cool. I love that quote that\u2019s like, \"It\u2019s only cringy until it works.\" I feel like at first, I was a little bit more sensitive to any negativity, which there honestly hasn\u2019t been a ton of, which is really nice because I know on the internet when I post other kinds of content, there can be. But usually with poems, it\u2019s pretty positive. Anybody who\u2019s being mean on the internet, I would never admire those people, so I find that I can\u2019t be scared of them either.",
      "I had one go super viral at the end of 2023, the public pool one. And that was kind of the first one that I was like, \u201cWoah, what just happened?\u201d I think as kind of unfortunate as it is, one of the main ways that I want to push forward is when people are encouraging me to do so, and sometimes it does take a little bit of enforcement. And being encouraged by celebrities that I\u2019ve looked up to for a long time, I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This could be something.\u201d",
      "I believe that I had just gone shopping or was looking at bathing",
      "Some of the most resonating things are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way.",
      "Josie balka",
      "suits online and I was just thinking about how crappy of an experience that always is for me. And I just have never, ever put any significance into why I love somebody based on their body. I kind of was like, \u201cWhy are you so worried that everyone's looking at you when you\u2019ve never looked at anybody else and remembered them?\u201d",
      "It kind of spiraled into all these other reasons that describe why people care about who you are and not how you look, and different scenarios in your life. I feel like it\u2019s a really important thing to remember.",
      "I lost over 100 pounds, and I have lots of trauma from it. I\u2019ve had a few surgeries for loose skin and that kind of stuff. After my first plastic surgery for my lower body, I got sepsis and almost died. It's crazy that I did this for how I looked, and then I almost died. And it didn\u2019t make me any happier. It just made me feel smaller, and I kind of thought that was the only thing I needed or wanted.",
      "And then there was kind of a big realization when I got to my goal. I still had all these things to work through and my happiness was never really dependent on the way that I looked in the way that I thought. I think there\u2019s a lot of people who sit around saying, \u201cWell, if I just lost 10 pounds \u2026 if I didn\u2019t have this loose skin, my life would be so much better.\u201d But there\u2019s no end goal, you just find something else. The way you look will never be the only thing. And I feel like I\u2019ve learned that firsthand a lot over the last few years.",
      "Some of the most resonating things I find are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way, because I truly don\u2019t think there are many unique experiences. Often if you just say the one thing that you carry the most shame over out loud, you\u2019ll find 100 other people that feel that way too. That\u2019s kind of why I leaned into it.",
      "It goes both ways.  Every time somebody goes, \"Oh, I really related to this thing, it made me feel less alone,\" I get to be like, \"Oh, because you related to this, now I know that I\u2019m not alone in that thought.\" I hope that other people scrolling through the comment section of a video they resonate with are seeing 100 other people that are like, \"Me too, me too, me too.\" And we can make everyone feel less alone together.",
      "I would have to have more of a routine with it. I usually just write down ideas as they come to me. I'll think of a line while I\u2019m driving or at work and I\u2019ll just type it into my phone. Eventually I\u2019ll scroll through all the one-liners on my notes app and expand on one of them. And if I feel like it\u2019s good enough, I\u2019ll go downstairs in my studio and record and post it. I\u2019d say 99% of the time, I write, record and post all in the same night.",
      "He was not wanting to do vows in front of people. He is very loving and very sweet and he\u2019s not shy to tell me how he feels but he is definitely shy to speak in front of a crowd. Originally he was like, \u201cCan we please just do private vows?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNope, I want to do them in front of everybody.\u201d So we are going to do them.",
      "I honestly don\u2019t think they will be that crazy or that amazing. They\u2019ll be pretty personalized, it\u2019ll probably be the way I would talk to him on a normal day.",
      "I think that\u2019s kind of the scary thing about success: It never feels like enough. Like everything after, if it\u2019s not quite up to par, you always feel like you didn\u2019t do as good a job, you know? Obviously in my head, I hope for success moving forward. But I also just hope to keep enjoying it. I love doing it, it\u2019s my total passion. It\u2019s my journal entries come to life. It\u2019s what my therapist told me to do to get regulated. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that it\u2019s turned into something like this, and I just hope that I continue to love that and I continue to be able to connect with people.",
      "I remember saying to my therapist once at the beginning, \"What if I can\u2019t continue it? What if I can\u2019t maintain it?\" And she was like, \"Nobody can ever take away what\u2019s already happened.\" So I think that I get to move forward knowing that what\u2019s already happened is mine. Obviously I hope for more of it, but even if all I got was what I have, I would be so happy to have it."

      "As \u201cLove Island USA\u201d headed into its fourth week, fan-favorite Hannah Fields was dumped from the island, despite having what many considered to be the strongest connection in the villa with Pepe.",
      "It was a twist few viewers saw coming, and as she exited the villa, a few burning questions for her remained. In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, she comes with some answers.",
      "Charlie or Pepe? Where Hannah\u2019s Heart Lies",
      "The end of Hannah\u2019s journey on \u201cLove Island USA\u201d was a choice made by her fellow islanders. During Sunday\u2019s episode, the islanders were informed that America had been voting on their favorite guys and girls, as individuals. When the bottom three guys and bottom the girls were revealed, the rest of the villa had to choose two people \u2014 a guy and a girl \u2014 to dump. The girls eliminated Hannah, and the guys nixed Jeremiah.",
      "To many viewers, the islanders\u2019 selections were shocking moves. Jeremiah had been coming out of his shell after finding resolution in his hectic breakup with Huda. As for Hannah, she had just witnessed her first connection, Charlie, exit the villa in the same way and was finding a bit of happiness with a new guy, Pepe.",
      "Following her elimination, a pressing question remained: Does Hannah\u2019s heart lie with Pepe ... or with Charlie?",
      "\u201cMy heart is waiting for Pepe to get out of that villa,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve just been waiting and waiting to see if that\u2019s going to go anywhere. We had a really good talk before I left, and I\u2019ve just really been missing him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come from this, and I don\u2019t know where his heart lies. I just know how I feel.\u201d",
      "Hannah also acknowledges her complicated feelings about Charlie, too: \u201cI think with Charlie as well, I don\u2019t know where his heart lies now. Obviously a lot has happened since he\u2019s left, and that can\u2019t be easy to witness.\u201d",
      "For now, she\u2019s acknowledges that the \u201creal world\u201d is much different than the villa, where around-the-clock proximity plays a big role.",
      "She adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s a waiting game to see where everything lies out and what really aligns for us, and see if we really work outside of the villa.\u201d",
      "Did Hannah Hope Pepe Would Leave With Her?",
      "Feelings are always heightened immediately following dumpings, and Hannah\u2019s was no exception. Was there any part of Hannah that thought Pepe might feel strongly enough to leave with her?",
      "\u201cHe had kind of mentioned it, but I just don\u2019t really think that it was an option,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cEven when Charlie left, I had thought about leaving. I think I had told Iris, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to go,\u2019 but I just don\u2019t think it was an actual option to leave. I don\u2019t really know exactly. Maybe it is.\u201d",
      "Despite her disappointment in leaving her connection behind in Fiji, Hannah holds no grudges against Pepe for staying.",
      "\u201cI kind of had told him, \u2018Don\u2019t ruin your experience.\u2019 I wanted him to have the best experience, and I don\u2019t hold it against him for not leaving at all, definitely. But you know I wish that he could have.\u201d",
      "Who Does Hannah See Winning \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Despite the girls choosing to send her home, Hannah maintains that they will remain close.",
      "\u201cI think our sisterhood is really, really strong,\u201d Hanna tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think obviously there were moments where we\u2019d have little, you know, back-and-forth arguments \u2014 but honestly not really. There were only a couple notable ones and we really bounced back super fast from that.\u201d",
      "She mentions Huda, who had pursued Pepe briefly without being upfront with Hannah about it.",
      "\u201cI did have that falling out with Huda and we never really resolved that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that would need to be resolved post-villa, but I\u2019m not closing myself off to any of them.\u201d",
      "Drama aside, Hannah maintains hope for her villa friendships and even has someone she\u2019s rooting to win.",
      "\u201cEven though she hurt my feelings, I really hope that Cierra, either with Nic or this new connection with Elan, I hope that she really gets her man,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cI think she\u2019s really deserving, and I think that she\u2019s somebody who really was there for the true reason of finding a partner.\u201d",
      "As for watching the rest of the season? \u201cOh, yes I will, absolutely. Even if I wasn\u2019t on the show, I would\u2019ve watched the show the whole time.\u201d"

      "\u201cThey asked me, \u2018What\u2019s your preferences?\u2019 So I just said, '45 to 60,' just being honest,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then the process went and I was selected and then we had lunch with the executive producer. I said, \u2018You know, if they\u2019re 60 or over, I\u2019m cutting them.\u2019\u201d",

      "\"They got to be fit because I\u2019m staying in shape and work out and stuff. And I told them, 'Try to stay away from the artificial hips and the wigs,'\" he shared.",

      "TODAY.com reached out to Warner Bros. and ABC for comment but has not heard back yet.",
      "After hearing about his dating preferences, social media users said they're not interested in watching the new season of \"The Golden Bachelor.\"",

      "\"Ok thanks #TheGoldenBachelor and ABC for the heads up so I know NOT to watch this loser on TV,\" one person wrote on X in regards to Owens.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve been rooting for Joe and Georgia for a long time as well,\u201d Ablack says.",
      "Joe and Georgia\u2019s connection has been a decades long slow burn. The two first met as teenagers in a flashback scene, when Joe showed Georgia an unexpected act of kindness during a difficult time in her life. Years later, they crossed paths again after Georgia moved to Wellsbury, Massachusetts, with her two children, Ginny (Brianne Howey) and Austin (Diesel La Torraca), and a troubled past she couldn\u2019t leave behind. Since then, their relationship has remained unresolved, marked by tension, bad timing and unspoken feelings that have kept viewers invested.",

      "\u201cHe confesses his feelings for her (again) because they haven\u2019t changed,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cThe timing is starting to become right for her.\u201d",
      "But, Ablack says, Georgia and Joe are not quite ready to get together. For one, Georgia is newly divorced from Paul (Scott Porter), the mayor. Then there are the legal troubles. She\u2019s currently on trial for the murder of Cynthia\u2019s (Sabrina Grdevich) husband and the Department of Child Services has temporarily removed her children, Ginny and Austin, from her custody. With so much unresolved, Joe and Georgia\u2019s future remains uncertain.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019re together in perfect harmony just yet,\u201d Ablack says of the pair. \u201cGeorgia needs to take some time and give some attention to her kids who need her right now \u2026 so they understand each other, but they\u2019re not getting involved yet.\u201d",
      "Ablack thinks Joe is waiting for Georgia to be ready.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that Joe has any judgment for Georgia,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants her to feel any kind of shame \u2026 if she were ready today to be together romantically, I think he would be very open to it.\u201d",
      "The topic of timing comes up between Joe and Georgia this season. In one episode, Joe pointedly questions the timeline of Georgia\u2019s relationship with her ex, Paul. For example, in a tense scene, a drunk Paul reveals to Joe that he had been intimate with Georgia. Joe, clearly unsettled, repeatedly asks Paul when it happened, pressing for specifics.",
      "Ablack says Joe\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t about jealousy, but about seeking clarity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to understand when and how real their relationship could be,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cIf they had sex after Joe and Georgia had that conversation, it would hurt Joe\u2019s feelings a little bit.\u201d",
      "The season ends with a cliffhanger: Georgia is pregnant. With unresolved feelings for Joe and a recent relationship with Paul, it\u2019s unclear who the father is.",
      "When asked how Joe would feel if he were the father, Ablack says, \u201cI think he would love to be the father of Georgia\u2019s child. Joe is great with kids \u2026 he\u2019s a pushover and a teddy bear.\u201d",
      "Even if he\u2019s not the biological father, Ablack believes Joe would fully embrace a parental role.",
      "\u201cI think Ginny and Austin could bully him into getting whatever they want,\u201d Ablack says with a laugh. \u201cHe would enjoy being manipulated.\u201d",
      "The actor also predicts how Joe\u2019s growing relationship with Georgia might affect her kids.",
      "\u201cI think (Ginny) would be a cheerleader for the relationship,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cBut I have no idea how Austin will respond to a new relationship. I hope that Joe will still approach everyone with love and compassion.\u201d",

      "A series that wasn\u2019t originally designed for a second season, \u201cSquid Game\u201d became a phenomenon with hundreds of millions of views around the world.",
      "Season 1 introduced audiences to the Korean series in which a secret game show was played on a remote island for the benefit of a few, wealthy, masked, VIPs, with only one winner allowed to take home the prize.",
      "Seasons 2 and 3 returned that winner (Lee Jung-jae, who played Seong Gi-hun, aka Player 456) to the arena, but also delved into the lives of the armed, pink-suited guards and a bulldog detective determined to shut the whole system down.",
      "Now that the final game (or so we think) has been played, who were the winners? Who were the losers? Let\u2019s dig into what we know. But beware \u2014 things get dark in this \u201cGame.\u201d",
      "Warning: Spoilers for all of \"Squid Game\" ahead.",
      "Does Player 456 die in 'Squid Game'? Seong Gi-hun's fate, explained",
      "Gi-hun went through the wringer in Seasons 2 and 3. He brought himself back into the game in order to subvert it, believing that his experience could foment a rebellion among the players. It turned out in the game \u2014 as often in real life \u2014 players preferred to vote for their own personal interests, rather than what was best for the collective, a brutal metaphor.",
      "Disillusioned by humanity after several of the games, Gi-hun checked out of active participation as much as he could \u2014 until circumstances brought him a baby to protect during the game. The baby was given its late mother\u2019s (Jo Yuri, playing Kim Jun-hee, aka Player 222) number, and permitted to \u201cparticipate\u201d in her stead.",
      "In the final round of the Game, Gi-hun and the baby made it to the last stage. They\u2019d had to face off numerous final players in the last test, which involved pushing players from the top of several tall towers. But on the final tower, Gi-hun, the baby, and Player 333 (Yim Si-wan, playing Lee Myung-gi, the baby\u2019s father) were the only ones left standing. The rules dictated that one person on the tower must die for the game to end, but that person had to die after a button on the tower is pressed. Gi-hun and Myung-gi fight \u2014 and Myung-gi fell from the tower.",
      "Unfortunately, the button wasn't pushed before he fell, so time had not started and the death didn't count. A death was still required to end the game. The VIPs in their protected booth expected Gi-hun to sacrifice the baby \u2014 but they clearly didn't know him well. There's no real winning at Squid Game, the show seemed to be saying \u2014 all that money didn\u2019t make Gi-hun\u2019s life a whole lot better. So Gi-hun kissed the baby, put her on the ground and turn to the camera to say, \u201cWe are not horses. We are humans.\u201d Then he fell from the tower and died.",
      "It\u2019s a bittersweet ending, but a profound one \u2014 and answered the question Front Man asked Gi-hun in Season 3: \u201cDo you still have faith in people?\u201d",
      "By not sacrificing an innocent baby, we got Gi-hun\u2019s final answer.",
      "So, who wins \u2018Squid Game\u2019 in Season 3?",
      "Player 222, the infant.",
      "What about the detective, Jun-ho, who\u2019s been investigating the Squid Game?",
      "Hwang Jun-ho (played by Wi Ha-joon) was too late to save Gi-hun, but he was able to send the Korean Coast Guard to the island.",
      "Jun-ho did rescue the escaped Player 246 (Park Gyeong-seok, played by Lee Jin-wook), whose daughter was hospitalized with leukemia.",
      "Jun-ho arrived on the island, looking for his brother (In-ho, aka Front Man, played by Lee Byung-hun), making it to the VIP chamber \u2014 just as In-ho retrieved Player 222/the baby from the top of the final tower.",
      "Jun-ho considered shooting his brother, but couldn't, afraid of harming the baby. Six months after the game ended, Jun-ho found the baby and the game\u2019s prize money left for him (probably by In-ho).",

      "Kang No-eul (aka Guard 011, played by Park Gyuyoung), had lost her daughter and bonded with Player 246\u2019s child before coming to the island as a guard.",
      "But when she discovered the organ harvesting operation going on between the guards and the dead players, she stepped up her efforts to help Player 246 escape.",
      "She destroyed all evidence he had been on the island, and was prepared to die in the Front Man\u2019s office when she saw Gi-hun\u2019s sacrifice. Hearing the baby, she decided not to kill herself.",
      "Six months later, she showed up visiting Player 246 in the amusement park where he still works, and where she used to work in a costume. He remained unaware that she was the one who saved his life, since she had her pink suit and mask on the whole time. She reunited with Player 246\u2019s daughter, now healthy.",
      "But there\u2019s a twist: No-eul is a North Korean defector who was separated from her daughter. She gets news the child might be alive in China. We last see No-eul at the airport, ready to get on a plane to possibly visit her daughter.",
      "If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s similar to the way Season 1 ended, with Gi-hun about to go see his own daughter in Los Angeles.",
      "Does Gi-hun live on?",
      "Kind of. When we first met Gi-hun in Season 1, one reason he got into the Game in the first place was so he could support his daughter. But after he won, he became obsessed with ending the game.",
      "With Gi-hun dead, In-ho (Front Man) made the trip Gi-hun didn\u2019t: He went to the U.S. to see the late player\u2019s daughter. He handed over a box of Gi-hun\u2019s belongings to his daughter \u2014 a bloody uniform and a debit card, which probably had the remainder of Gi-hun\u2019s winnings on it. Did In-ho change his own opinion about humanity\u2019s worth? It seemed he was preparing to do so.",
      "Will there be more \u2018Squid Game\u2019?",
      "Based on the final scenes, we suspect yes.",
      "In the last scene, after In-ho finished dropping off the winnings to Gi-hun\u2019s daughter, he spotted a woman playing the introductory card-slap game with someone in an alley. And not just anybody \u2014 he saw a Recruiter, played by Cate Blanchett! They didn't speak to each other, though she nodded with recognition at him and he moved on.",
      "Season 1 informed us that Squid Games are played around the world, and last October Deadline reported that an English-language version of the series was being developed with director David Fincher. Maybe we\u2019ve just seen the first scene in \u201cSquid Game: USA\u201d?"

      "\u201cThe best insights are ones that we don\u2019t have to explain to each other, we just \u2018get it\u2019 \u2014 and people just get the analogy,\u201d Reno tells TODAY.com. \u201cEven though Diet Coke might not want to be associated with cigarettes, it\u2019s a truth about the brand that resonates with millions of people.\u201d",
      "While the term \u201cfridge cigarette\u201d is new to the internet\u2019s lexicon, the idea of treating oneself to a Diet Coke break is not.",
      "In spring 2023, the hashtag #dietcokebreak racked up millions of views on TikTok, which led some publications to deem the practice \u201cGen Z\u2019s version of the smoke break.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Diet Coke break is something I do look forward to when I am in the office,\u201d Dedrick Boyington-Warmack, a then-27-year-old marketing manager, told Fortune in 2023. \u201cI usually don\u2019t bring soda into my home.\u201d",
      "And a June 2023 post on X described Diet Coke as having \u201ccigarette aesthetic.\u201d",
      "The comparison may persist because of the idea that sodas \u2014 even diet ones \u2014 are not good for you. A 2020 study found that those who drank many beverages with artificial sweeteners had a higher risk of heart disease than those who didn\u2019t consume them.",
      "On June 9, Reno posted a follow-up video expanding on the orginal idea, categorizing regular Coke, Coke Zero and other diet sodas into types of cigarettes.",
      "\u201cPeople mentioning La Croix or sparkling water, respect to you, for me, that is a juice treat,\u201d she says, adding that they are tantamount to prop cigarettes in plays. \u201cA few people have asked about full-fat Coke in the glass bottle, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s a cigar.\u2019\u201d"

      "In the episode prior, original islanders Olandria and Nic had been eliminated from the show in two dramatic re-couplings. Six of the guy bombshells in Casa Amor were tasked with choosing among the seven girl islanders to couple with, and Olandria was left as the single one out. Nic, who had been among the six guy islanders left back at the villa, exited in the same situation.",
      "The girls in Casa had tearfully bid adieu to Olandria \u2014 and just after the guys said farewell to Nic, a twist threw things for a loop. A black car pulled up to the villa to greet Nic \u2014 and there was Olandria, ready to take him \u2026 well, where?",

      "What Happens With Nic and Olandria?",
      "The end of the last episode left viewers eager to know what happens with Nic and Olandria. Were they leaving the island or not?",
      "Episode 21 answers those questions: The black car takes Nic and Olandria to \u2026 a date. They sit at a table for two beneath twinkle lights, sipping Champagne as they debrief the last few days.",
      "\u201cI have so much to tell you,\u201d Nic says. \u201cI want to hear everything.\u201d",
      "Olandria tells Nic about Cierra, who had spent her few days at Casa Amor getting to know a bombshell named Elan. Cierra had been conflicted about this, however, because she already had strong feelings for Nic back at the villa. Nic, meanwhile, had told Cierra before Casa Amor that he wanted to keep seeking other connections.",
      "\u201cThat worries me,\u201d Nic tells Olandria. \u201cI told her I wanted to be open because I want to test this connection, but I felt like she wanted to be closed off. But then now I\u2019m sitting here, like, I didn\u2019t find anybody. And she found somebody in Casa. It\u2019s going to be a test, for sure.\u201d",
      "Now Nic tells Olandria about Taylor. He had been vibing in the villa with a bombshell named Clarke, though he and Olandria had a maintained a connection before Casa.",
      "\u201cTaylor\u2019s my good friend, but I\u2019m putting that off to the side right now,\u201d Nic says. \u201cThe girl I was coupled up with, Clarke, chose him at the re-coupling. He feels this emotional connection with her. And he also feels this physical connection with her.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to take my man from me, Taylor was never mine to begin with,\u201d Olandria says to Nic.",
      "Then Nic gets a text: He and Olandria both now have a choice. They can each remain single but they must leave the island tonight \u2014 or they can couple up and return to the villa together.",
      "Olandria\u2019s in favor of coupling to return to the villa. Then Nic adds, \u201cI just want to say, I\u2019ve been wanting to get to know you. I feel like we haven\u2019t had the opportunity to get these conversations.\u201d",
      "Olandria agrees \u2014 she felt Nic had a lot going on with Cierra and Belle-A and didn\u2019t want to insert herself.",
      "So that\u2019s when Nic and Olandria execute a plan to get back to the villa. After the guy islanders and girl bombshells head to bed, Nic and Olandria sneak back in. They get into their PJs, creep into the bedroom and crawl into the same bed as a new couple.",
      "As the sun rises, the viewers see what happens. They\u2019re all shocked \u2014 sort of? \u2014 to see Olandria and Nic back at the villa. Nic tells the rest of he guy islanders about what he learned about Casa from Olandria. Taylor seems like he\u2019s in the biggest pickle: He\u2019s vibing with Clarke, but that could get weird now that Olandria\u2019s back.",
      "Later, Nic and Olandria chat a bit about their own situation in Soul Ties. Nic says he felt a connection with Olandria from the beginning of the show. Olandria is smitten but admits in a confessional that this is complicated; Taylor is one of Nic\u2019s closest friends, while she and Cierra are also tight.",

    "summary": "If Iran opts to pursue a clandestine nuclear weapons project, the regime would have to shore up its heavily compromised security, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist was driving to his country house with his wife on an autumn day four years ago. As he slowed down for a speed bump, a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a nearby pick-up truck fired a volley of bullets, killing him instantly, Iranian authorities said.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of a dormant nuclear weapons project known as Project Amad, illustrated in brutal fashion how deeply Israel had penetrated Iran. That vulnerability has only been exposed further in recent weeks, with Israeli air strikes killing several other scientists believed to be involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "Iran\u2019s political leaders now face a dilemma. After the heavy U.S. bombing of their nuclear sites and air defenses, they can strike a painful compromise with Washington and abandon their uranium enrichment program, or revive the secret weapons project masterminded by Fakhrizadeh.",
      "Unlike other countries that were able to develop nuclear weapons in secret, Iran cannot assume it will be able to keep its work hidden. Israel has demonstrated repeatedly it can evade Iran\u2019s security, uncover its clandestine nuclear activities and hunt down senior figures in the military, former intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s principal challenge in pursuing a covert pathway is going to be keeping it hidden from U.S. and Israeli detection,\u201d said Eric Brewer, a former intelligence official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit focusing on global security.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the key challenge, because both countries, particularly Israel, have demonstrated an ability to penetrate Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Israel has demonstrated an ability to use kinetic force to take it out.\u201d",
      "The Israeli air force has effectively wiped out Iran\u2019s air defenses. For the moment, Iran cannot protect any target on its territory -- especially suspected nuclear sites -- from a U.S. or Israeli bombing raid, former intelligence officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis have complete intelligence dominance over Iran,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cIf they see something emanating as a threat, they will take it out. . .That could mean military strikes. It could be covert action.\u201d",
      "Iran has already tried once to build an atomic bomb under the veil of secrecy. It had a covert nuclear weapons project more than two decades ago, according to Western intelligence agencies.",
      "But its cover was blown in December 2002, when satellite photos emerged showing an enrichment site in the city of Natanz and a heavy water plant about 200 miles away in Arak.",
      "Iran has denied it ever had a weapons program. Archival documents stolen in 2018 by Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, which the U.S. says are authentic, showed detailed plans to build five nuclear weapons.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons project in 2003. At that point, the secrecy around the project had been breached and Iran had reason to be anxious in the wake of a U.S. invasion in neighboring Iraq.",
      "Since then, Iran maintained what it said was a civilian nuclear program. Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear work gave Tehran the potential option to pursue an eventual weapon if it chose to go that route \u2013 what arms control experts call a \u201cthreshold\u201d nuclear capability.",
      "Stolen blueprints",
      "If the regime chooses to race towards a bomb, it will be calculating that nuclear weapons will discourage any adversary from trying to stage an attack or topple its leadership. And it would be following a familiar path taken by other countries that successfully pursued secret bomb projects, including North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel.",
      "The Israeli government kept the Americans in the dark about their nuclear weapons project for years.",
      "In the 1950s, French engineers helped Israel build a nuclear reactor and a secret reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel. Israel\u2019s government to this day does not officially confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal, saying it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",
      "India\u2019s nuclear program also began in the 1950s, with the United States and Canada providing nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel for purely peaceful purposes. India agreed to safeguards designed to prevent the reactors and fuel from being used for weapons.",
      "But India secretly reprocessed spent fuel into plutonium in the 1960s, building up fissile material for a nuclear weapon. By 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test, code-named Smiling Buddha.",
      "Pakistan built its bomb with the help of nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, a metallurgist who stole blueprints and other information on advanced centrifuges while working at a nuclear engineering firm in Amsterdam. Khan later was linked with distributing nuclear weapons technology to Iran and North Korea among others.",
      "Khan\u2019s assistance in the 1990s proved crucial for North Korea\u2019s program. The Pyongyang regime also bought technology and hardware abroad through front companies or on the black market, according to U.N. monitors.",
      "It was America that helped Iran launch its nuclear program, before the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy. During the Shah\u2019s rule, through the U.S. \u201cAtoms for Peace Program,\u201d the United States provided nuclear technology, fuel, training and equipment to Iran in the 1960s, including a research reactor.",
      "Now Iran likely has no need to turn to outside partners for technical know-how, experts say. Still, the regime will have a daunting task reconstituting whatever is left of its nuclear program.",
      "Every known nuclear site in Iran was targeted in Israel\u2019s air campaign earlier this month. And then last week the U.S. launched an attack on three enrichment sites using 14 \u201cbunker buster\u201d 30,000-pound bombs and more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles. The CIA says key facilities were destroyed and the nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the strikes.",
      "Despite the unprecedented damage, which is still being assessed, it\u2019s possible Iran may have the technical means to relaunch a weapons program \u2013 including enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground sites, some arms control experts say.",
      "Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be accounted for, and it has an unknown number of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by Israel, NBC News has reported.",
      "Iran\u2019s most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it in Isfahan.",
      "Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a facility, and it\u2019s unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal product plant elsewhere.",
      "Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.",
      "\u201cIt really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said. \"They still have a lot of capability left.\"",
      "After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel\u2019s air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend itself and preserve the regime\u2019s survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "\u201cIran has every reason now, based on what\u2019s just happened, to say we\u2019ve got to have a bomb, [and] we\u2019ll be treated differently if we do,\u201d Weinbaum said.",
      "Officials in Iran\u2019s regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons will help ensure the regime\u2019s survival or endanger its grip on power, regional analysts said.",
      "Looming over Iran\u2019s decision is the threat of Israeli espionage and air power, potentially catching Tehran in the act of rushing to produce a bomb.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the regime buckles down and gets serious about it, or whether their operational security remains as terrible as ever,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have been so careless.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to hold talks on a possible agreement with Iran in coming days to try to halt its uranium enrichment in return for sanctions relief.",
      "Meanwhile, American and Israeli spy agencies \u201cwill be laser focused on trying to see what Iran is doing behind the scenes,\u201d Polymeropoulos said."

      "Lu said most of her spending goes toward supporting celebrities she likes. Occasionally, she allows herself a \u201csmall indulgence\u201d in the form of \u201cblind box\u201d toys such as Disney dolls or the Labubu monster figurines that have become a global frenzy.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not that into these dolls,\u201d she said, adding that the purchase is more about having fun with friends as they open the blind box together to see which doll is inside.",
      "Lu\u2019s spending habits reflect a growing trend in recent years among young Chinese who show \u201clow interest\u201d in big purchases such as houses and cars but are embracing food and cultural products that offer \u201cinstant emotional gratification,\u201d according to the Fudan Development Institute, a Shanghai-based think tank.",
      "This phenomenon, also known as \u201cemotional consumption,\u201d has resulted in average annual growth of about 12% in industries including films and games since 2013, according to a report in March by the Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft. The overall market for emotional consumption is projected to exceed $270 billion this year, the report said.",
      "Sweet drinks, low prices, happier life",
      "One of the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese consumer trends has been the country\u2019s beverage sector, which according to S&P Global is expected to grow up to 6% this year.",
      "Mixue, a bubble tea chain known for its cheap drinks, now has more stores worldwide \u2014 over 45,000, with nearly 10% of them outside mainland China \u2014 than any other food and beverage chain, including McDonald\u2019s, which has a global store count of 43,000, and Starbucks, with 38,000. In March, Mixue\u2019s shares jumped more than 40% on its market debut in Hong Kong.",
      "The brand\u2019s success stems largely from its low prices and rapid expansion, especially in less developed cities, as Chinese people adjust their spending habits while grappling with job security and other economic concerns.",
      "Kelsey Yu, 23, a graduate student in Beijing, said she bought a bottle of lemonade from Mixue for the equivalent of less than $1 on a visit in April to the southern Chinese city of Jieyang.",
      "\u201cThe drink quenched my thirst. It had a large portion and was cheap,\u201d she said, adding that Mixue\u2019s items are \u201cbetter value for money\u201d than those of many local competitors.",
      "Yu said that as a foodie, she drinks tea-based beverages at least once or twice a week and may \u201cindulge a bit more\u201d while traveling.",
      "\u201cI usually order milk tea when I\u2019m feeling tired or if I just want to have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have self-control. So I won\u2019t have it every day.\u201d",
      "A complicated picture of Chinese consumption",
      "While U.S. officials often say Chinese consumers are not spending enough, the situation is not as clear-cut as it is portrayed, analysts said.",
      "In the past quarter-century, China\u2019s consumer spending has grown an average of 8% or more each year, one of the highest rates among major economies. But it has been outstripped by investment, making consumption a smaller part of China\u2019s overall GDP.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cSummer Davos\u201d event in Tianjin on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said China sought to become a \u201cmega-sized consumption powerhouse.\u201d",
      "Boosted by government subsidies, China\u2019s retail sales grew 6.4% in May, the fastest rate since late 2023.",
      "Sales during this year\u2019s monthlong 618 online shopping festival, which ended June 18, were a record 855.6 billion yuan ($119 billion), according to retail data provider Syntun, 15.2% higher than last year.",
      "Young Chinese in particular are \u201cliving frugally to spend big,\u201d according to state-backed research. Though they are budget-conscious when it comes to daily necessities, they \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate to splurge\u201d for their hobbies and happiness, it said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather spend 300 yuan ($42) on a great meal, and if the food is really good, I would think it\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Yu said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a 300-yuan piece of clothing, I might hesitate.\u201d",
      "Amid China\u2019s economic challenges, middle-class consumers are less brand-conscious and prefer cheaper alternatives, said Yaling Jiang, founder of ApertureChina, a consulting firm that specializes in consumer research.",
      "\u201cNow saving is seen as cool, and seeking value is seen as cool,\u201d Jiang said. \u201cI think the downturn definitely changed the culture of spending.\u201d",
      "Chinese mallgoers these days spend money almost exclusively on the first and second floors, where food and beverage shops are concentrated, Jiang said.",
      "\u201cPeople are walking around the mall with a cup of milk tea or coffee,\u201d she added, looking at what\u2019s available in stores before going home to buy cheaper alternatives online.",
      "China\u2019s luxury market, which had accounted for almost a third of global sales, declined 18% to 20% last year, according to a January report by Bain and Company.",
      "\u201cI think there is less focus on the social status comparison, and more focus on what brings them personal happiness,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING, a post-pandemic change that has also been seen elsewhere.",
      "Consumers in China are both trading up and spending down, depending on the sector, said Shan Guo, a partner at Hutong Research, an investment advisory group based in Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey are not buying luxury bags, but they are buying Pop Mart,\u201d  Guo said, referring to the Chinese retailer behind the Labubu toys. \u201cLabubu can be quite expensive.\u201d",
      "Despite concerns about slower economic growth in China and elsewhere, Lu, the Melbourne student, said her friends are still \u201cquite willing to spend for fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not big spenders,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just happy to treat themselves when having a good time.\u201d"

      "Al-Issa was also a member of Hamas\u2019 General Security Council, the IDF said. In the past, Al-Issa led the group\u2019s \u201cforce-buildup efforts in the Gaza Strip\u201d and served as head of the training headquarters.",

      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory assault on the Gaza Strip has killed more than 56,000 people and has left thousands more wounded, displaced and with sparse resources, including food, water and medical supplies.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday indicated that a ceasefire might come into play within the next week. It was not clear whether it would be a temporary or permanent ceasefire, or if any prisoner exchanges would be involved like in past temporary ceasefire agreements.",

      "While China is the world\u2019s top producer of rare earths, it still imports raw materials containing the coveted metals from abroad.",
      "Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China\u2019s total rare earth imports last year, Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.",
      "According to Chinese Customs data, Myanmar\u2019s rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023.",
      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s rare earth risks",
      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

      "Three children and their parents were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent camp in Muwasi near the southern city of Khan Younis. They were struck while sleeping, relatives said.",
      "\u201cWhat did these children do to them? What is their fault?\u201d said the children\u2019s grandmother, Suad Abu Teima, as others knelt to kiss their bloodied faces and wept. Some placed red flowers into the body bags.",
      "Also among the dead were 12 people near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people, and eight more in apartments, according to staff at Shifa Hospital. More than 20 bodies were taken to Nasser Hospital, according to health officials.",
      "A midday strike killed 11 people on a street in eastern Gaza City, and their bodies were taken to Al-Ahli Hospital. A strike on a gathering at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed two, according to Al-Awda hospital.",
      "Hopes for a ceasefire agreement in the coming week",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump says there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week. Taking questions from reporters on Friday, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of.\u201d",

      "Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of hiding among civilians because they operate in populated areas.",
      "There is hope among families of hostages that Trump\u2019s involvement in securing the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran might lead to more pressure for a deal in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is riding a wave of public support for the Iran war and its achievements, and he could feel he has more space to move toward ending the war in Gaza, something his far-right governing partners oppose.",
      "Hamas has repeatedly said it is prepared to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu says he will end the war only once Hamas is disarmed and exiled, something the group has rejected.",

      "\u201cToday, the violence and destruction comes to an end, and the entire region begins a new chapter of hope and opportunity, harmony, prosperity and peace,\u201d President Donald Trump told the foreign ministers of the two countries at a White House meeting.",
      "The agreement was signed earlier at the State Department\u2019s Treaty Room beneath a portrait of Colin Powell, the first African American to hold the job of top U.S. diplomat. There, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it \u201can important moment after 30 years of war.\u201d",

      "While the deal is seen as a turning point, analysts don\u2019t believe it will quickly end the fighting because the most prominent armed group says it does not apply to it. Many Congolese see it mainly as an opportunity for the U.S. to acquire critical minerals needed for much of the world\u2019s technology after their government reached out to Trump for support in fighting the rebels.",
      "Trump has pushed to gain access to such minerals at a time when the United States and China are actively competing for influence in Africa.",
      "Congo\u2019s Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner invoked the millions of victims of the conflict in signing the agreement with Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe. Both expressed optimism but stressed significant work still to do to end the fighting.",
      "\u201cSome wounds will heal, but they will never fully disappear,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThose who have suffered the most are watching. They are expecting this agreement to be respected, and we cannot fail them.\u201d",
      "Nduhungirehe noted the \u201cgreat deal of uncertainty\u201d because previous agreements were not put in place.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the road ahead will not be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the continued support of the United States and other partners, we believe that a turning point has been reached.\u201d",
      "They, along with Rubio, lauded the support of the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar in facilitating the agreement, which Doha has been working on for months at the request of the U.S. and others.",
      "The agreement has provisions on territorial integrity, prohibition of hostilities and the disengagement, disarmament and conditional integration of non-state armed groups.",
      "Asked in the Oval Office about violations of the agreement, Trump said he didn\u2019t think that would happen but also warned of \u201cvery severe penalties, financial and otherwise,\u201d if it did.",
      "The peace deal is not likely to end the conflict quickly",
      "The Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group is the most prominent armed group in the conflict, and its major advance early this year left bodies on the streets. With 7 million people displaced in Congo, the United Nations has called it \u201cone of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth.\u201d",
      "Congo hopes the U.S. will provide it with the security support needed to fight the rebels and possibly get them to withdraw from the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, and from the entire region where Rwanda is estimated to have up to 4,000 troops. Rwanda has said that it\u2019s defending its territorial interests and not supporting M23.",
      "M23 rebels have suggested that the agreement won\u2019t be binding for them. The rebel group hasn\u2019t been directly involved in the planned peace deal, although it has been part of other ongoing peace talks.",
      "Corneille Nangaa, leader of Congo River Alliance \u2014 known by its French acronym AFC \u2014 which includes M23, told The Associated Press in March that direct peace talks with Congo can only be held if the country acknowledges their grievances and that \u201canything regarding us which are done without us, it\u2019s against us.\u201d",
      "An M23 spokesperson, Oscar Balinda, echoed that to the AP this week.",
      "Nduhungirehe pointed to separate talks happening in Qatar that are meant to get both Congo and the M23 rebels to agree among themselves how they will end the fighting. He also said Rwanda agreed to lift its \u201cdefensive measures.\u201d It was not clear if he meant withdrawing the troops that Rwanda has said are defending its territorial interests.",
      "Rwanda also has been accused of exploiting eastern Congo\u2019s minerals, used in smartphones, advanced fighter jets and much more. Rwanda has denied any involvement, while analysts say that might make it difficult for Rwanda not to be involved in the region.",
      "The deal is at the heart of the U.S. government\u2019s push to counter China in Africa. For many years, Chinese companies have been a key player in Congo\u2019s minerals sector. Chinese cobalt refineries, which account for a majority of the global supply, rely heavily on Congo.",
      "What the US role looks like in ending the conflict",
      "Congo\u2019s foreign minister said the U.S. has proven to be a \u201creliable partner\u201d during the peace process and on other issues in relations between the two countries.",
      "\u201cSo there is no doubt in this moment, if you want, when it comes to the credibility of the U.S. as a partner, be it for a peace process, where we have signed a very important agreement today, or for investment from the U.S.,\u201d Wagner told the AP in an interview Friday evening.",
      "Analysts say the U.S. government\u2019s commitment might depend on how much access it has to the minerals being discussed under separate negotiations between the American and Congolese governments.",
      "The mostly untapped minerals are estimated to be worth as much as $24 trillion by the U.S. Department of Commerce.",
      "Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol, called the deal a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d but said it could \u201cin no way eliminate all the issues of the conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe current draft agreement ignores war crimes and justice for victims by imposing a partnership between the victim and the aggressor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seems like a trigger-happy proposition and cannot establish lasting peace without justice and reparation.\u201d",
      "In Congo\u2019s North Kivu province, the hardest hit by the fighting, some believe that the peace deal will help resolve the violence but warn justice must still be served for an enduring peace.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the Americans should be trusted 100%,\u201d said Hope Muhinuka, an activist from the province. \u201cIt is up to us to capitalize on all we have now as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "The conflict can be traced to the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, where Hutu militias killed between 500,000 and 1 million ethnic Tutsi, as well as moderate Hutus and Twa, Indigenous people. When Tutsi-led forces fought back, nearly 2 million Hutus crossed into Congo, fearing reprisals.",
      "Rwandan authorities have accused the Hutus who fled of participating in the genocide and alleged that elements of the Congolese army protected them. They have argued that the militias formed by a small fraction of the Hutus are a threat to Rwanda\u2019s Tutsi population.",
      "Since then, the ongoing conflict in east Congo has killed 6 million people, in attacks, famines and unchecked disease outbreaks stemming from the fighting."

    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "With Sudan in the grips of war and millions struggling to find enough to eat, many are turning to weeds and wild plants to quiet their pangs of hunger. They boil the plants in water with salt because, simply, there is nothing else.",
      "Grateful for the lifeline it offered, a 60-year-old retired school teacher penned a love poem about a plant called Khadija Koro. It was \u201ca balm for us that spread through the spaces of fear,\u201d he wrote, and kept him and many others from starving.",
      "A.H, who spoke on the condition his full name not be used, because he feared retribution from the warring parties for speaking to the press, is one of 24.6 million people in Sudan facing acute food insecurity \u2014nearly half the population, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. Aid workers say the war spiked market prices, limited aid delivery, and shrunk agricultural lands in a country that was once a breadbasket of the world.",
      "Sudan plunged into war in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary the Rapid Support Forces escalated to fighting in the capital Khartoum and spread across the country, killing over 20,000 people, displacing nearly 13 million people, and pushing many to the brink of famine in what aid workers deemed the world\u2019s largest hunger crisis.",
      "Food insecurity is especially bad in areas in the Kordofan region, the Nuba Mountains, and Darfur, where El Fasher and Zamzam camp are inaccessible to the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Mathilde Vu, an aid worker with the group based in Port Sudan. Some people survive on just one meal a day, which is mainly millet porridge. In North Darfur, some people even sucked on coal to ease their hunger.",
      "On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Sudanese military leader Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and asked him for a week-long ceasefire in El Fasher to allow aid delivery. Burhan agreed to that request, according to an army statement, but it\u2019s unknown whether the RSF would agree to that truce.",
      "A.H. said aid distribution often provided slight relief. His wife in children live in Obeid and also struggle to secure enough food due to high prices in the market.",
      "His poem continued: \u201cYou were a world that sends love into the barren time. You were a woman woven from threads of the sun. You were the sandalwood and the jasmine and a revelation of green, glowing and longing.\u201d",
      "Fighting restricted travel, worsening food insecurity",
      "Sudanese agricultural minister Abu Bakr al-Bashari told Al-Hadath news channel in April that there are no indicators of famine in the country, but there is shortage of food supplies in areas controlled by the paramilitary forces, known as RSF.",
      "However, Leni Kinzli, World Food Programme Sudan spokesperson, said 17 areas in Gezeira, most of the Darfur region, and Khartoum, including Jebel Aulia are at risk of famine. Each month, over 4 million people receive assistance from the group, including 1.7 million in areas facing famine or at risk, Kinzli said.",
      "The state is suffering from two conflicts: one between the Rapid Support Forces and the army, and another with the People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North, who are fighting against the army and have ties with the RSF, making it nearly impossible to access food, clean water, or medicine.",
      "He can\u2019t travel to Obeid in North Kordofan to be with his family, as the Rapid Support Forces blocked roads. Violence and looting have made travel unsafe, forcing residents to stay in their neighborhoods, limiting their access to food, aid workers said.",
      "A.H. is supposed to get a retirement pension from the government, but the process is slow, so he doesn\u2019t have a steady income. He can only transfer around $35 weekly to his family out of temporary training jobs, which he says is not enough.",
      "Hassan, another South Kordofan resident in Kadugli said that the state has turned into a \u201clarge prison for innocent citizens\u201d due to the lack of food, water, shelter, income, and primary health services caused by the RSF siege.",
      "International and grassroots organizations in the area where he lives were banned by the local government, according to Hassan, who asked to be identified only by his first name in fear of retribution for speaking publicly while being based in an area often engulfed with fighting.",
      "So residents ate the plants out of desperation.",
      "\u201cYou would groan to give life an antidote when darkness appeared to us through the window of fear.,\u201d A.H. wrote in his poem. \u201cYou were the light, and when our tears filled up our in the eyes, you were the nectar.",
      "Food affordability",
      "Vu warned that food affordability is another ongoing challenge as prices rise in the markets. A physical cash shortage prompted the Norwegian Refugee Council to replace cash assistance with vouchers. Meanwhile, authorities monopolize some markets and essential foods such as corn, wheat flour, sugar and salt are only sold through security approvals, according to Hassan.",
      "Meanwhile, in southwest Sudan, residents of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, rely on growing crops, but agricultural lands are shrinking due to fighting and lack of farming resources.",
      "Hawaa Hussein, a woman who has been displaced in El Serif camp since 2004, told the AP that they benefit from the rainy season but they\u2019re lacking essential farming resources such as seeds and tractors to grow beans, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and weika \u2014 dried powdered okra.",
      "Hussein, a grandmother living with eight family members, said her family receives a food parcel every two months, containing lentils, salt, oil, and biscuits. Sometimes she buys items from the market with the help of community leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are many families in the camp, mine alone has five children, and so aid is not enough for everyone \u2026 you also can\u2019t eat while your neighbor is hungry and in need,\u201d she said.",
      "El Serif camp is sheltering nearly 49,000 displaced people, the camp\u2019s civic leader Abdalrahman Idris told the AP. Since the war began in 2023, the camp has taken in over 5,000 new arrivals, with a recent surge coming from the greater Khartoum region, which is the Sudanese military said it took full control of in May.",
      "\u201cThe food that reaches the camp makes up only 5% of the total need. Some people need jobs and income. People now only eat two meals, and some people can\u2019t feed their children,\u201d he said.",
      "In North Darfur, south of El Fasher, lies Zamzam camp, one of the worst areas struck by famine and recent escalating violence. An aid worker with the Emergency Response Rooms previously based in the camp who asked not to be identified in fear of retribution for speaking with the press, told the AP that the recent wave of violence killed some and left others homeless.",
      "Barely anyone was able to afford food from the market as a pound of sugar costs 20,000 Sudanese pounds ($33) and a soap bar 10,000 Sudanese pounds ($17).",
      "The recent attacks in Zamzam worsened the humanitarian situation and he had to flee to a safer area. Some elderly men, pregnant women, and children have died of starvation and the lack of medical treatment, according to an aid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s fearful of retribution for speaking publicly while living in an area controlled by one of the warring parties. He didn\u2019t provide the exact number of those deaths.",
      "He said the situation in Zamzam camp is dire\u2014\u201cas if people were on death row.\u201d",
      "Yet A.H. finished his poem with hope:",
      "\u201cWhen people clashed and death filled the city squares\u201d A.H. wrote \u201cyou, Koro, were a symbol of life and a title of loyalty.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump, a Republican, has sought to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration during the first four months of his presidency. Noem, who shares Trump\u2019s hardline stance, moved in February to end TPS for some 350,000 Venezuelans, as well as thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled on May 19 that the Trump administration could proceed with ending TPS for those Venezuelans, signaling that other terminations also may be permitted to move forward.",
      "The court in a separate order on May 30 said that the administration could immediately revoke a separate status known as parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",

      "But as a fragile ceasefire holds, cyber defenders in the United States and Israel say they have so far seen little out of the ordinary \u2014 a potential sign that the threat from Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities, like its battered military, has been overestimated.",

      "\u201cThe volume of attacks appears to be relatively low,\u201d said Nicole Fishbein, a senior security researcher with the Israeli company Intezer. \u201cThe techniques used are not particularly sophisticated.\u201d",

Hospital officials said 18 people were killed.",
      "The strike was the latest violence surrounding the distribution of food to Gaza\u2019s population, which has been thrown into turmoil over the past month. After blocking all food for 2 1/2 months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since mid-May.",
      "Efforts by the United Nations to distribute the food have been plagued by armed gangs looting trucks and by crowds of desperate people offloading supplies from convoys.",
      "The strike in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday appeared to target members of Sahm, a security unit tasked with stopping looters and cracking down on merchants who sell stolen aid at high prices. The unit is part of Gaza\u2019s Hamas-led Interior Ministry, but includes members of other factions.",
      "Witnesses said the Sahm unit was distributing bags of flour and other goods confiscated from looters and corrupt merchants, drawing a crowd when the strike hit.",

      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has accused the militant Hamas group of stealing aid and using it to prop up its rule in the enclave. Israeli forces have repeatedly struck Gaza\u2019s police, considering them a branch of Hamas.",
      "An association of Gaza\u2019s influential clans and tribes said Wednesday that they had started an independent effort to guard aid convoys to prevent looting. The National Gathering of Palestinian Clans and Tribes said it helped escort a rare shipment of flour that entered northern Gaza that evening.",

      "The National Gathering slammed the statement, saying the accusation of theft was aimed at justifying the Israeli military\u2019s \u201caggressive practices.\u201d It said aid was \u201cfully secured\u201d by the tribes, which it said were committed to delivering the supplies to the population.",
      "The move by tribes to protect aid convoys brings yet another player in an aid situation that has become fragmented, confused and violent, even as Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million Palestinians struggle to feed their families.",
      "Throughout the more than 20-month-old war, the U.N. led the massive aid operation by humanitarian groups providing food, shelter, medicine and other goods to Palestinians despite the fighting. U.N. and other aid groups say that when significant amounts of supplies are allowed into Gaza, looting and theft dwindles.",
      "Israel, however, seeks to replace the U.N.-led system, saying Hamas has been siphoning off large amounts of supplies from it, a claim the U.N. and other aid groups deny.",
      "Israel has backed an American private contractor, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has started distributing food boxes at four locations, mainly in the far south of Gaza, for the past month.",
      "Thousands of Palestinians walk for hours to reach the hubs, moving through Israeli military zones where witnesses say Israeli troops regularly open fire with heavy barrages to control the crowds.",
      "Health officials say hundreds of people have been killed and wounded. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots.",
      "Israel has continued to allow a smaller number of aid trucks into Gaza for U.N. distribution. The World Health Organization said Thursday that it had been able to deliver its first medical shipment into Gaza since March 2, with nine trucks bringing blood, plasma and other supplies to Nasser Hospital, the biggest hospital still functioning in southern Gaza.",
      "In Gaza City, large crowds gathered Thursday at an aid distribution point to receive bags of flour from the convoy that arrived the previous evening, according to photos taken by a cameraman collaborating with the AP.",
      "Hiba Khalil, a mother of seven, said she cannot afford looted aid that is sold in markets for astronomical prices and was relieved to get flour for the first time in months.",

      "\u201cThe gangs used to take our shares and the shares of our children who slept hungry and thirsty,\u201d she said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Six Americans were detained Friday in South Korea for trying to send 1,600 plastic bottles filled with rice, miniature Bibles, $1 bills and USB sticks toward North Korea by sea, police said.",
      "The Americans were apprehended on front-line Gwanghwa Island before throwing the bottles into the sea so they could float toward North Korean shores on the tides, two Gwanghwa police officers said. They said the Americans were being investigated on allegations they violated the law on the management of safety and disasters.",
      "The officers, who requested anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to media on the issue, refused to provide personal details of the Americans in line with privacy rules.",
      "Gwanghwa police said they had not found what is on the USB sticks.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in South Korea had no immediate public comment.",
      "For years, activists have sought to float plastic bottles or fly balloons across the border carrying anti-North Korea propaganda leaflets and USB thumb drives carrying South Korean dramas and K-pop songs, a practice that was banned from 2021 to 2023 over concerns it could inflame tensions with the North.",
      "North Korea has responded to previous balloon campaigns with fiery rhetoric and other shows of anger, and last year the country launched its own balloons across the border, dumping rubbish on various South Korean sites including the presidential compound.",
      "In 2023, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court struck down a controversial law that criminalized the sending of leaflets and other items to North Korea, calling it an excessive restriction on free speech.",
      "But since taking office in early June, the new liberal government of President Lee Jae Myung is pushing to crack down on such civilian campaigns with other safety-related laws to avoid a flare-up in tensions with North Korea and promote the safety of front-line South Korean residents.",
      "On June 14, police detained an activist for allegedly flying balloons toward North Korea from Gwanghwa Island.",
      "Lee took office with a promise to restart long-dormant talks with North Korea and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula. Lee\u2019s government halted front-line anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts to try to ease military tensions. North Korean broadcasts have not been heard in South Korean front-line towns since then.",
      "It remains unclear whether North Korea will respond to Lee\u2019s conciliatory gesture after it vowed last year to sever relations with South Korea and abandon the goal of peaceful Korean reunification. Official talks between the Koreas have been stalled since 2019, when the U.S.-led diplomacy on North Korean denuclearization derailed."
