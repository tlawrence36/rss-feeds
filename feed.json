      "Despite some favorable reviews \u2014 including a three-out-of-four-star one from The Associated Press \u2014 the new \u201cTron\u201d film starring Jared Leto, Greta Lee and Jeff Bridges earned $33.5 million, according to Comscore estimates on Sunday.

      "\u201cIt's been tough for that franchise to gain traction for it to become a big mega franchise,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. He noted that the original \u201cTron\u201d movie in 1982 initially struggled at the box office, but it ultimately grew a cult following.",
      "Dergarabedian said the international numbers could play a key role toward the film's profitability.",

      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",
      "\u201cI chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something more about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right),\u201d Coppola wrote.",

      "Allen encouraged her to wear what she wanted to wear, and so she assembled her iconic outfit \u2014 khaki pants, vest, tie \u2014 from \u201ccool-looking women on the streets of New York.\u201d The hat was lifted from actor Aurore Clement.",

      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t content created by a third party. These were the companies\u2019 own chatbots working to advance their own depraved internal policies,\" said Prince Harry at Spring Studios in Manhattan Thursday night as he and Markle were named Humanitarians of the Year by the nonprofit Project Healthy Minds. \"But here\u2019s what gives us hope: these families aren\u2019t facing this alone.\u201d",

      "The couple has made youth mental health a cornerstone of their philanthropic work since launching the Archewell Foundation in 2020 after stepping aside as working royals. Through its network for families who have experienced online harm and support of youth-led organizations shaping responsible technology, the nonprofit works to make digital spaces safer.",

      "According to numerous studies, few guardrails exist to mitigate kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content including pornography and violence on social media, where they also face cyberbullying and sexual harassment.",
      "The issue could also be considered personal for the couple. Markle has been open about her mental health struggles due to what she describes as the royal family\u2019s intense pressures and tabloid attacks. Harry's own personal life has been the subject of much tabloid reporting, including targeted phone hacking and surveillance.",
      "Prince Harry brought his awareness campaign to a reception Wednesday night hosted by men's health nonprofit Movember.

      "Archaeologists at the Colosseum Archaeological Park explained that Roman emperors would use the passage to enter the arena unseen and protected, leading them directly to their reserved honor box overlooking the games.",
      "The passage was named after Emperor Commodus, who ruled alone between 180 A.D. and 192 A.D., when it was initially discovered in the 1810s. Commodus was known to be passionate about gladiators\u2019 games and history relates that while he was passing through the tunnel, someone attempted to assassinate him, but was unsuccessful.",
      "At the passage entrance, archaeologists discovered remnants of decorative elements directly related to arena spectacles, including depictions of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobatic performances. These artistic elements provided a fitting prelude to the brutal entertainments that awaited beyond, they noted.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Hungarian writer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, whose philosophical, bleakly funny novels often unfold in single sentences, won the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday for his for his \"compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art.\u201d",
      "Several works including his debut, \u201cSatantango\u201d and \u201cThe Melancholy of Resistance,\u201d were turned into films by Hungarian director B\u00e9la Tarr.",
      "The Nobel judges praised his \u201cartistic gaze which is entirely free of illusion, and which sees through the fragility of the social order combined with his unwavering belief in the power of art,\" Steve Sem-Sandberg of the Nobel committee said at the announcement.",
      "\u201cL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai is a great epic writer in the Central European tradition that extends through (Franz) Kafka to Thomas Bernhard, and is characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess,\" the Nobel judges said.",
      "Krasznahorkai, 71, could not immediately be reached for his reaction. He did not speak at the announcement.",
      "He has received many awards including the 2015 Man Booker International Prize. The Booker judges praised his \u201cextraordinary sentences, sentences of incredible length that go to incredible lengths, their tone switching from solemn to madcap to quizzical to desolate as they go their wayward way.\u201d",
      "He also won the National Book Award for Translated Literature in the U.S. in 2019 for \u201cBaron Wenckheim\u2019s Homecoming.\u201d",
      "The American writer and critic Susan Sontag has described Krasznahorkai as the \u201ccontemporary master of the Apocalypse.\u201d He was also friends with American poet and writer Allen Ginsberg and would regularly stay in Ginsberg\u2019s apartment while visiting New York City.",
      "He is the first winner from Hungary since Imre Kertesz in 2002. He joins an illustrious list of laureates that includes Ernest Hemingway, Toni Morrison and Kazuo Ishiguro.",
      "The literature prize has been awarded by the Nobel committee of the Swedish Academy 117 times to a total of 121 winners. Last year's prize was won by South Korean author Han Kang for her body of work that the committee said \u201cconfronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.\u201d",
      "The literature prize is the fourth to be announced this week, following the 2025 Nobels in medicine, physics and chemistry.",

      "In Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d Yale academics go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield",
      "It\u2019s not so often that the font of a movie\u2019s opening credits is, itself, a provocation.",
      "But in Luca Guadagnino \u2019s muddled but darkly absorbing \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d the white Windsor Light Condensed lettering against a black background, with cast in alphabetical order and soft jazz playing, is immediately recognizable as the style of a Woody Allen movie opening.",
      "In the juggling act to follow in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d where Guadagnino will playfully twirl a twisting narrative of alleged sexual assault, cancel culture, privilege in academia and Gen Z victimization, the credits are not so much an opening salvo than they are an introductory wink.",
      "Like many an Allen film, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is set among a well-educated, self-involved class. It takes place around Yale University. But unlike Allen\u2019s anxious, existential, chattering characters, Guadagnino\u2019s cocktail party collection of professors and students is a more scheming and unpleasant lot.",
      "That includes a philosophy professor, Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), on the precipice of tenure, her friend and department colleague, Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), and Imhoff\u2019s star pupil, a Ph.D. student named Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), who after a party at Alma\u2019s house accuses Hank of sexual assault.",
      "Guadagnino\u2019s film, shot by Malik Hassan Sayeed, is somberly and flatly lit and rife with reflections. Under these drab surfaces, the central characters of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d \u2014 an ensemble of singularly charming actors who here have drained away much of their natural charisma \u2014 go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield.",
      "That, at least, is the promise of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d But Guadagnino\u2019s dour and languid film, scripted by Nora Garrett, only fitfully coheres as the conversation piece it aspires to be. Its plot turns can be rash or implausible, and the movie increasingly feels like ideas and set pieces strung tenuously together.",
      "Yet I also enjoyed the prickliness of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Though there\u2019s a strong anti-woke vein to it, Guadagnino\u2019s film is more about how seemingly quite different generations have much more in common than they might appear. The cultural debates depicted in the movie are often so colored by moralistic superiority, but that\u2019s not the case here. Everyone is kind of rotten in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s especially unusual for Roberts, whose Alma is far more complicated a character than she normally tackles. Alma is esteemed, fiercely intelligent, ambitious and hard to read. Her husband, a psychiatrist named Frederik (a fabulous Michael Stuhlbarg as combustible cocktail of cuckold and cook) worships her, but her affection is less evident.",

      "But shorn of her natural ebullience, Roberts' restraint of the role comes off more like weariness. That adds to some of the off-kilter tenor of \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d but it\u2019s hard not to imagine someone like Cate Blanchett in the part.",
      "\u201cWhen did offending someone become a cardinal sin?\u201d Hank asks at the party that opens the movie.",
      "A sign of what Guadagnino might be up to comes not long after, after Maggie has alleged the assault. Alma goes to meet a distraught Hank at a local restaurant. While they hash out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s fiction in Maggie\u2019s account, it\u2019s hard not to notice the mirrors that surround Hank.",
      "The real mirror of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is Alma and Maggie. Edebiri is here a kind of stand-in for Gen Z, and her case expands to include a wider range of issues of inclusivity and othering. As things spiral and Maggie\u2019s case leads to increasing intensity on campus and in Alma\u2019s personal life, Alma shifts from Maggie\u2019s mentor to something more like a foe. But Alma\u2019s own past begins to play a role in the fallout, adding a new frame to \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d that casts Alma and Maggie\u2019s plights in a different light.",
      "Is this a good time? Not especially, though Garfield is great in a rage. Glib insertions don\u2019t help. In one scene, when Alma meets a fellow faculty member (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) in a bar, a Smiths song plays and she seems surprised a Morrissey tune isn\u2019t outlawed.",
      "I'm not sure \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has too much more to say than that shrug-of-the-shoulders scene. But \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d deserves credit not so much more wading into these hot-button topics, but for trying to find its own way through them. It's not a #MeToo procedural but more like a tragedy. When \u201coptics over substance\u201d governs all, as one character laments, no one lives happily ever after.",
      "\u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d an Amazon MGM release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language and some sexual content. Running time: 139 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny's music catalog has seen a jump in streams since his 2026 Super Bowl halftime performance was announced.",
      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.",
      "Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has \u201cdone and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater. After being turned down in Berlin, Villaz\u00f3n won over Serge Dorny, then general director in Lyon and now head of the Bavarian State Op\u00e9ra.",

      "Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance goes to extreme lengths to make immersive environments for his actors",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The lengths writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes to create immersive environments for his actors has grown into a kind of legend. After making the much-improvised doomed romance of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), Michelle Williams said she would have to remind herself that she was never, actually, married to Ryan Gosling.",
      "Cianfrance\u2019s last feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Light Between the Oceans,\u201d was shot almost entirely at a remote New Zealand lighthouse. The making of that film did lead together its stars, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. So did Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d with Gosling and Eva Mendes. Method filmmaking can produce real-life results.",
      "But Cianfrance\u2019s ways are for a purpose. He wants his actors, as much as possible, to live in a movie. For his latest film, \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, that approach was especially important because the story was so far-fetched.",
      "\u201cI wanted to immerse the entire cast in this story because it\u2019s a crazy story,\u201d Cianfrance said in an interview. \u201cJeff\u2019s actions are kind of unbelievable. I felt like just for me, to have my suspension of disbelief, I needed to be down there. I think that\u2019s why I do a lot of this immersion because I need to believe it. I need to believe it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d",
      "In \u201cRoofman,\u201d which Paramount Pictures releases Friday in theaters, Tatum plays Jeffrey Manchester, a U.S. Army veteran who found civilian life difficult. In 1998, he began robbing McDonald\u2019s by sawing through roofs. He\u2019s believed to have robbed more than 40 stores. Both his novel entry point, and his reported cordial manner with employees, made the \u201cRoofman\u201d an intriguing figure on the local TV news.",
      "In 2000, Manchester was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004, he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Charlotte Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. He clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves, and, most audaciously, trying to live a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated a woman named Leigh Wainscott (played by Dunst).",
      "Mostly, the events of \u201cRoofman\u201d happened as they\u2019re portrayed. But how do you make a stranger-than-fiction tale believable? For the filmmakers of \u201cRoofman,\u201d it meant going to some extreme lengths to give real-life authenticity to a made-for-Hollywood story. At a time when major studios seldom release star-led original films at all, let alone fiercely realistic ones shot on location, \u201cRoofman\u201d \u2014 a modest sized production cobbled together with an assortment of companies, including Miramax, FilmNation and Limelight \u2014 effectively tunneled its way to the big screen.",
      "\u201cI had many producers tell me: Why don\u2019t you shoot this in South Africa? You\u2019ll have double the amount of days,\u201d Cianfrance says, referencing the appeal of tax credits. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, because the people aren\u2019t there, and the ghosts of this story aren\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cianfrance wanted to shoot in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us where Manchester hid out, but he couldn\u2019t. The toy chain went bankrupt in 2017, and the one where Manchester camped out in is now a mega church. So, he turned an abandoned Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pineville, North Carolina, into a nearly fully operational one. The production redid the electricity, added plumbing, installed new fluorescent lighting and stocked 40,000 square feet of shelves with truckloads of period-appropriate toys.",
      "\u201cThat was my \u2018Fitzcarraldo,\u2019 bringing the steam ship over the mountain, building that Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d Cianfrance says, chuckling.",
      "That gave Tatum, whom Cianfrance had initially sought for \u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d a box store sandbox in which to play. The biggest gift Cianfrance could give to Tatum, he felt, was \u201cto unleash him in a toy store.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was 360, all around,\u201d says Tatum, speaking alongside Dunst. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a giant budget movie. It involved, like: \u2018There\u2019s not even enough toys from this era in the world to fill this place.\u2019 And Derek kept going. \u2018I promised Chan that he would have a fully working store where he could do whatever he wanted.\u2019 He put it on me!\u201d",
      "Dunst was particularly drawn to Cianfrance\u2019s process. \u201cThe kind of acting that Derek likes,\u201d Dunst says, \u201cis the kind of acting that I like: when it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s acting.\u201d",

      "Yet much of the most extensive work to give \u201cRoofman\u201d veracity was below the surface. Manchester is currently serving out his sentence at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. He can only make outgoing calls, but Cianfrance estimates that he spoke to him more than a hundred times. That gave Cianfrance an understanding of Manchester\u2019s motives and mistakes and turned \u201cRoofman\u201d into a comic but tender examination of misguided materialism.",
      "\u201cJeff wrote a crazy movie for himself, and he lived it,\u201d Cianfrance says. \u201cWhat made me ultimately understand what the movie was that Jeff \u2014 he was just trying to figure out how to be a dad. He was doing it all for family.\u201d",
      "Tatum also spoke frequently with Manchester by phone. Manchester, among other things, expressed his approval of the movie poster, featuring Tatum with a stuffed bear on his shoulders, a floaty around his waist and a gun in his right hand. Tatum says they bonded talking about their children and their hopes for the future. Manchester is scheduled to be released in 2036.",
      "\u201cI got more than I could possibly convey. I just found myself being held almost by him, taken care of,\u201d Tatum says. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up bad. But I definitely am a couple bad decisions away from hopefully not being in jail for 45 years. But I think we\u2019re all one or two bad decisions away from having a completely different life. Jeff did tell me, \u2018I got greedy.\u2019\u201d",
      "As he prepped the movie, Cianfrance interviewed everyone he could who was associated with Manchester\u2019s escape. Usually, he gave them parts. Wainscott plays a crossing guard in the film. The pastor of the church attended by Manchester, Ron Smith, plays a pawnshop owner. Dunst is interrogated by the police officers who actually interviewed Wainscott.",
      "Cianfrance cast Tatum and Dunst, he says, partly because they are each parents themselves. Dunst spent time with the actors who play her daughters, going shopping and making a meal together.",
      "\u201cIt builds layers that people feel when they watch a film,\u201d Dunst says.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could have done this movie without having my daughter, and specifically my journey with her. I miss her a lot,\u201d says Tatum. \u201cThat loneliness and wanting for that was something infused in there. I didn\u2019t have to create that.\u201d",

Not in his performance as a Yale philosophy professor accused of sexual misconduct in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d but while discussing an actor\u2019s responsibility to comment on the work they\u2019re putting out in the world.",
      "It\u2019s a blue-sky day outside the luxurious Hotel Cipriani and Garfield is seated alongside his co-stars Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri discussing a film that has, for better or worse, become the topic of some spirited debates. Just a few days prior at the Venice Film Festival, journalists at a press conference asked Roberts and filmmaker Luca Guadagnino if the film undermines the feminist movement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the actor\u2019s responsibility at all to express anything in public. Ever,\u201d Garfield said, using his hands for extra emphasis. \u201cPlease, tell them about the gesticulation.\u201d",
      "Roberts chimed in: \u201cThe hair as well.\u201d (It was bouncing).",
      "With \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d in theaters Friday, Guadagnino and his actors knew they were making something thorny, something challenging, about messy, imperfect people whose lives, and lies, are upended with the accusation. They were ready to own the decision to use a typeface in the opening credits made famous by Woody Allen. But they had not anticipated the anti-feminist question, which was perhaps less a question than an accusation.",
      "\u201cThis question was so tone deaf to the movie itself,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve mistaken the subject with the object.\u201d",
      "The film is an ensemble piece about a few characters in and around Yale whose heady philosophical chats about agency and power become less theoretical under the glare of sticky real life dramas. Roberts plays Alma, a revered professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and flirty drinking buddy Hank (Garfield). Edebiri is a student named Maggie, a child of billionaires who everyone says is brilliant and who is a little obsessed with Alma.",
      "After a boozy party at Alma\u2019s, Maggie comes to Alma first to tell her that Hank crossed the line. Hank denies anything happened and claims that Maggie is retaliating because he accused her of plagiarizing her thesis. No one knows quite who to believe. Alma, too, is harboring her own secrets. And everything in their world unravels in spectacularly melodramatic fashion.",
      "The screenplay comes from Nora Garrett, who was working as a data analyst at Meta before her script caught the attention of Guadagnino and Roberts, in quick succession.",
      "\u201cThe story really started with the character of Alma,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI was really interested in this idea of a woman who had a lie or something that she was deeply ashamed of at the core of her being.\u201d",
      "But Alma's controlled compartmentalization of her past starts to unspool with Maggie's accusation. The part allows Roberts to do some of her best work in years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m saying something that might sound obvious, but she\u2019s one of the greatest stars and one of the great actresses,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cThe symbol, the beauty of the symbol, and at the same time the truth of the performance. She\u2019s so three-dimensional.\u201d",

      "The new Skins Game will have a similar format. A player wins the dollar amount for each hole, and it carries over if the hole is tied. The difference is a \u201creverse purse,\u201d in which all four players start with $1 million and their fortunes rise or fall with every hole won or lost.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \u201cdedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\u201d said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \u201cThis auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\u201d",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \u201cThe Best of Joy of Painting,\u201d based on Ross' show, \u201cAmerica's Test Kitchen,\u201d \u201cJulia Child's French Chef Classics\u201d and \u201cThis Old House.\u201d",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources. Many launched emergency fund drives. Some have been forced to lay off staff and make programming cuts.",

The former Air Force drill sergeant known for his calm demeanor and encouraging words enjoyed a resurgence in popularity during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Ross spoke often as he worked on air about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \u201chappy accidents.\u201d",
      "The thirty paintings to be auctioned span Ross\u2019 career and include landscapes depicting serene mountain vistas and lake scenes, his signature aesthetic. He created most of the 30 on-air, each in under 30 minutes, which was the span of a single episode.",
      "Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750. The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said.",

      "Fewer choices may be on the menu again as Medicare patients shop for prescription coverage this fall.",
      "The number of available, stand-alone drug plans has fallen for a few years, and that trend will continue for 2026. Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "More people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Before 2023, that figure was often under 1%, said Dr. Christopher Cai, one of the researchers involved in the study.",
      "Monthly premiums, or coverage prices, will fall nearly 10% on average to $34.50, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced last month.",

      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",

      "District Judge Jackson Lofgren's said in his decision Wednesday that the law discriminates based on age and medical purpose, not sex, and that there's little evidence the Legislature passed the law for \u201can invidious discriminatory purpose.\u201d He also noted various concerns and ongoing debates over the medical treatments involved.",
      "\u201cThe evidence presented at trial establishes there is a legitimate concern regarding the capacity of minors to understand and appreciate the long-term consequences of the practices prohibited by the Health Care Law,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he doesn't believe the law violates the state constitution.",
      "The ruling means parents who decided to seek gender-affirming medical care for their children after the state's ban took effect in April 2023 will need to do so out of state.",
      "\u201cThis ruling is devastating for transgender youth and their families in North Dakota. The evidence in this case was overwhelming: this law inflicts real harm, strips families of their constitutional rights, and denies young people the medical care they need to thrive,\u201d Jess Braverman, the legal director for the gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice, which represented the plaintiff, said in a statement.",

      "About half of U.S. states, nearly all of which have fully Republican-led governments, have banned gender-affirming care for minors. North Dakota's law makes it a misdemeanor for a health care provider to prescribe or give hormone treatments or puberty blockers to a transgender child.

That led the families to miss work and school so they could travel to Minnesota for treatment.",

      "The law seeks to define ultraprocessed foods, the often super-tasty products typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats. The legislation requires the state\u2019s Department of Public Health to adopt rules by mid-2028 defining \u201cultraprocessed foods of concern\u201d and \u201crestricted school foods.\u201d",
      "Schools have to start phasing out those foods by July 2029, and districts will be barred from selling them for breakfast or lunch by July 2035. Vendors will be banned from providing the \u201cfoods of concern\u201d to schools by 2032.",
      "Newsom, flanked by first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom and state lawmakers, signed the measure at a middle school in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has never waited for Washington or anyone else to lead on kids\u2019 health \u2014 we\u2019ve been out front for years, removing harmful additives and improving school nutrition,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \"This first-in-the-nation law builds on that work to make sure every California student has access to healthy, delicious meals that help them thrive.\u201d",
      "Newsom issued an executive order earlier this year requiring the Department of Public Health to provide recommendations by April on limiting harms from ultraprocessed foods. The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 banning certain synthetic food dyes from school meals.",
      "Legislatures across the country have introduced more than 100 bills in recent months seeking to ban or require labeling of chemicals that make up many ultraprocessed foods, including artificial dyes and controversial additives.",
      "Americans get more than half their calories from ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to a host of health problems, including obesity, diabetes and heart disease. However, studies haven\u2019t been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems.",
      "Defining ultraprocessed foods has been tricky. The most common definition is based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo.",
      "Researchers often describe ultraprocessed foods as the types of products that contain industrially made ingredients that you won\u2019t find in a home kitchen.",
      "But some highly processed foods \u2013\u2014 think tofu, certain types of whole-grain bread and infant formula \u2013 can be healthful. And it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s the processing of the foods or the combination of nutrients such as sugar, fat and salt that leads to poor health outcomes.",
      "U.S. health officials recently launched an effort to come up with a federal definition of ultraprocessed foods, saying there are concerns over whether current definitions \u201caccurately capture\u201d the range of foods that may affect health.",
      "Some critics of the ban say it is too broad and could unintentionally limit access to nutritious foods.",
      "\u201cFor foods served in schools, food and beverage manufacturers meet the rigorous unique safety and nutrition standards set by the USDA and state agencies,\" John Hewitt with the Consumer Brands Association said in a statement. He added the brands the association represents are committed to \u201cproviding safe, nutritious and convenient\u201d products.",

      "The Kenyan capital Nairobi is renowned for having the only national park in a city",
      "KAJIADO, Kenya -- KAJIADO, Kenya (AP) \u2014 This year, less than a kilometer from where I live, a girl named Peace Mwende was killed by a lion. The news hit me hard: She was 14, the same age as my youngest daughter, and the lioness responsible may have been one of the animals we see in our neighborhood almost weekly.",
      "Our children are growing up in a part of Nairobi where lions roam free. We see them while taking our kids to school. We\u2019ve lost pets and livestock. Neighborhood WhatsApp groups share warnings when big cats come close \u2014 and feature CCTV footage of lions hunting family pets.",
      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",
      "\u201cDuring the rainy season, tall grass and shifting herbivore patterns make it difficult for carnivores to hunt,\u201d KWS wrote on a reel of a Nairobi lion cub rescue posted to its social media in July. The cub in the video had been seen starving in the park, causing a public outcry. KWS added it was \u201cconducting a feeding intervention, providing meat daily to the pride residing in the park to help them regain their strength and resume natural hunting.\u201d",
      "Nairobi National Park, bordering the city to the north, has long relied on vast southern grazing lands for its wildlife to migrate to other protected areas. With those areas fast turning into residential and industrial developments, Kenya\u2019s State Department for Wildlife announced a nearly $5 billion plan to create a migratory corridor between Nairobi and conservancies to the south. There are also nongovernment initiatives that pay landowners bordering Nairobi National Park a small annual fee to keep their properties unfenced for wildlife.",
      "But will it be enough?",
      "What\u2019s missing is greater awareness on how to behave around predators, especially among increasingly urban communities who are coming into contact with them.",
      "My children never learned this in school. Their closest encounter with a lion was in 2020, when we took advantage of a post-COVID bookings slump to show them the Maasai Mara National Reserve. An incredibly knowledgeable local guide led us through the southern reserve in a completely open safari vehicle, surrounded by surging wildebeest.",
      "On one outing, our guide stopped the car for a passing trio of hunting lionesses. The first strode by, ignoring us. The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",
      "\u201cKeep still,\u201d the guide murmured under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d",
      "Her curiosity satisfied, the lioness ducked under the car and moved on.",
      "That day, we learned a lesson in predator behavior during a holiday experience very few Kenyans can afford. It may have recently saved my wife\u2019s life when she encountered a lioness in our garden. Checking to see what our dog was barking at, she spotted a lioness under a bush less than 10 yards away. Only its head was visible.",

      "In December 2019, a man named Simon Kipkirui went out to Tuala, a small settlement across the river from us. He decided, against friends' advice, to walk home at night. He never made it. He lived in our compound; he had helped to build our house and to plant many of the trees that now form the indigenous forest that surrounds our home.",
      "I called his brother, and a group went out to retrace his steps. Nothing. Two more days passed before his brother, Daniel Rono, discovered a bag of maize flour lying in a patch of wilderness between our home and Tuala. He investigated.",
      "\u201cI reached for the maize flour and saw Simon\u2019s head. It was separated from his body. I reached for the head and saw a hand, then a leg inside a gumboot,\u201d Daniel remembers. Horrified, he called me. As we started on the grisly task of trying to find Simon\u2019s remains, we were pushed back by a warning growl. It was a male lion, still guarding the kill.",
      "At this point, Simon had been missing for 2 1/2 days. No one knows whether the lion that was with him by the time we found him was responsible for his death. Lions who kill humans \u2013 the notorious man-eaters \u2013 are shot to avoid recurrence, and KWS claim to have shot the lioness that killed Peace Mwende the night of that attack.",
      "Although human-wildlife conflict has existed for as long as humans have, predator attacks are likely to rise as space for Kenya\u2019s lions shrinks and their hunting opportunities diminish. This can only spell doom for Nairobi\u2019s world-famous national park, which some already want to see turned into housing developments.",
      "I mourn Simon like the friends and colleagues who died on assignment in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Every lion sighting also still fills me with joy and wonder, in spite of the horrors of that day in 2019. I hope solutions can be found to keep both people and lion populations safe, and that this remarkable wilderness that makes Nairobi such a unique capital city survives for the joy and wonder of many others.",

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",
      "Abbott's office did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Abbott has the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats believe health care is an issue that resonates with a majority of Americans as they demand an extension of subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the shuttered U.S. government. But it is also one of the most intractable issues in Congress \u2014 and a real compromise amid the government shutdown will not likely be easy, or quick.",
      "There are some Republicans in Congress who want to extend the higher subsidies, which were first put in place in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as millions of people who receive their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are set to receive notices that their premiums will increase at the beginning of the year. But many GOP lawmakers are strongly opposed to any extension \u2014 and see the debate as a new opportunity to cut back on the program altogether.",

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ rights case, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ+ rights case Tuesday, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children.",
      "The justices are hearing a lawsuit from a Christian counselor challenging a Colorado law that prohibits therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity. Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",
      "Therapy isn't just speech, they said \u2014 it's health care that governments have a responsibility to regulate. Violating the law carries potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation.",
      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in conversion therapy, it devastated Ryan\u2019s bond with me and my husband,\" she said. \u201cAnd it absolutely destroyed his confidence he could ever be loved or accepted by God.\u201d",
      "Chiles contends her approach is different from the kind of conversion therapy once associated with practices like shock therapy decades ago. She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

The group also represented a Christian website designer who doesn\u2019t want to work with same-sex couples and successfully challenged a Colorado anti-discrimination law in 2023.",
      "The group's argument in the conversion therapy case also builds on another victory from 2018: A Supreme Court decision found California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion. Chiles should also be free from that kind of state regulation, the group argued.",
      "Still, the Supreme Court has also found that regulations that only \u201cincidentally\u201d burden speech are permissible, and the state argues that striking down its law against conversion therapy would undercut states' ability to regulate discredited health care of all kids.",
      "The high court agreed to hear the case after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the law. Another appeals court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has struck down similar bans in Florida.",

Virginia officials, by contrast, have agreed to scale back the enforcement of its law as part of an agreement with a faith-based conservative group that sued.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 The date for Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s imprisonment will be set Monday, after the former French president was sentenced to five years in prison for criminal conspiracy in a scheme to finance his winning 2007 campaign with funds from Libya.",
      "Sarkozy, 70, says he\u2019s innocent. He denounced the verdict as \u201ca scandal\u201d and filed an appeal. He is the first former president of modern France sentenced to actual time behind bars.",
      "Sarkozy, who was involved in several other legal cases, was France's president from 2007 to 2012. He has been retired from active politics for years but remains very influential, especially in conservative circles.",
      "In a surprise decision, the Paris court said the prison sentence, which would otherwise have been suspended on appeal, is effective immediately.",
      "Sarkozy must be incarcerated without delay, the court explained, because \"of the seriousness of the disruption to public order caused by the offense,\u201d",
      "Still, Sarkozy was given 18 days since the ruling to \u201corganize his professional life\u201d before his summoning by the National Financial Prosecutor\u2019s office to set a date for incarceration.",
      "Sarkozy\u2019s supporters criticized the ruling because Sarkozy, since he appealed, is presumed to be innocent according to French law.",
      "The debate has been recently revived after far-right leader Marine Le Pen was sentenced in March to a five-year ban on running for public office for embezzling EU funds, also taking effect immediately despite her appeal.",
      "Sarkozy\u2019s case does not appear as an exception in France\u2019s judicial system. The justice ministry said in 2024, 90% of adults convicted and sentenced to at least two years in prison were immediately incarcerated.",
      "The court said Sarkozy, as a presidential candidate and interior minister, used his position \u201cto prepare corruption at the highest level\u201d from 2005 to 2007, to finance his presidential campaign with funds from Libya \u2014 then led by longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "The panel of three judges stated that Sarkozy\u2019s closest associates, Claude Gu\u00e9ant and Brice Hortefeux, held secret meetings in 2005 with Abdullah al-Senoussi, Gadhafi's brother-in-law and intelligence chief, despite the fact that he was \u201cconvicted of acts of terrorism committed mostly against French and European citizens.\u201d",
      "Al-Senoussi is considered the mastermind of attacks on a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 and a French airliner over Niger the following year \u2014 causing hundreds of deaths. He was convicted and sentenced in absentia to a life sentence by a Paris court in 1999 for the attack on the French UTA Flight 772.",
      "The court also said there was evidence Sarkozy endorsed meetings between Gu\u00e9ant, then his chief of staff, and an intermediary able to provide secret financial arrangements.",

      "He suggested that the allegations of campaign financing were retaliation for his call \u2014 as France\u2019s president \u2014 for Gadhafi\u2019s removal.",
      "Sarkozy was one of the first Western leaders to push for military intervention in Libya in 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world. Gadhafi was toppled and killed in the uprising that same year, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.",
      "In addition, Sarkozy insists the court cleared him of three other charges, including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealing the embezzlement of public funds.",
      "The court said there's no evidence the money transferred from Libya to France ended up being used in Sarkozy's 2007 campaign and acknowledged it was not used to serve his \u201cdirect personal enrichment.\u201d",
      "For safety reasons, Sarkozy is expected to be incarcerated under conditions reserved for high-profile inmates, possibly in a special area that has been dubbed the \u201cVIP area\u201d of La Sant\u00e9 prison, the only prison located in Paris. This is where some of France's most notorious criminals have been imprisoned.",
      "Once behind bars, Sarkozy will be able to file a release request to the appeals court. Judges will then have up to two months to process the request.",

      "Chinese coast guard ships have used powerful water cannons and rammed a Philippine government vessel near Thitu Island in the South China Sea",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 Chinese coast guard ships used powerful water cannons on Sunday and rammed and slightly damaged an anchored Philippine government vessel off an island inhabited by Filipinos in the disputed South China Sea, the Philippine coast guard said.",
      "There were no injuries among Filipino crewmen of the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, part of the fisheries fleet that provides support to Filipino fishermen. The Chinese coast guard targeted Pagbuaya off the Philippines-occupied Thitu island in the latest flare-up of the long-simmering territorial disputes involving Manila, Beijing and four other governments.",
      "Two other Philippine fisheries vessels were targeted with water cannons in Sunday\u2019s faceoff, which occurred at least 1.6 nautical miles (nearly 3 kilometers) from Thitu island. There were no damages or injuries, Philippine coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a news briefing on Monday.",
      "The Chinese coast guard accused the Philippine vessels of illegally entering what it called Chinese waters near a cluster of sandbars known as Sandy Cay, which lies between Thitu and China\u2019s artificial island base called Subi and \u201cignoring repeated stern warnings from the Chinese side.\u201d It said it \u201ctook control measures against the Philippine vessels in accordance with the law and resolutely drove them away.\u201d",
      "China has repeatedly restated its sovereignty and control over virtually the entire South China Sea, a major trade route, despite a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated its historic claims. That ruling has been rejected by China but supported by the United States and its Western and Asian allies, including Japan, Australia, the European Union and Canada.",
      "The U.S. immediately condemned \u201cChina's aggressive actions in defiance of international law\" and expressed support for the Philippines, a close Asian treaty ally. U.S. Ambassador to Manila MaryKay Carlson praised the Filipino personnel involved in the incident for their \u201ctremendous valor and skill in the face of China's dangerous ramming and use of water cannons.\"",
      "Pagbuaya and two other Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vessels were anchored in the territorial waters off Thitu, called Pag-asa by the Philippines, when Chinese coast guard and suspected militia ships suddenly approached and staged \u201cdangerous and provocative maneuvers,\u201d Tarriela said on Sunday. He added that such aggression would not prompt Manila to \u201csurrender a square inch of our territory to any foreign power.\u201d",
      "A Chinese coast guard ship with bow number 21559 \u201cfired its water cannon directly at the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, hitting the vessel,\u201d then rammed the stern of the Philippine fisheries vessel three minutes later, causing \u201cminor structural damage but no injuries to the crew.\u201d",

      "The responsibility rests entirely with the Philippine side, Liu said, accusing the Philippines of undermining the peace and stability in the South China Sea and \u201dsternly warned\u201d the Southeast Asian country \u201cto immediately stop infringement and harassment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe harassment we faced today only strengthens our resolve,\u201d Philippine coast guard commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan said. \u201cFilipino fisherfolk depend on these waters and neither water cannons nor ramming will deter us from fulfilling our commitment to Pres.

      "Thitu is the largest of nine islands, islets and reefs inhabited by Philippine forces and also has a fishing community in the Spratlys archipelago, the most fiercely disputed region of the South China Sea, where China turned seven barren reefs into island bases protected by a missile system.

      "Carlos Costa has fulfilled his childhood dream of owning a movie theater",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Carlos Costa would never forget the summer day his grandmother took him to the movies. He was 6 years old when he first walked into a dark theater to watch \u201cO Trapalh\u00e3o nas Minas do Rei Salom\u00e3o,\u201d a 1977 Brazilian comedy that remains one of the country\u2019s biggest box office hits.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw that giant screen, wow, I was mesmerized. I thought: someday I\u2019ll have a movie theater of my own,\u201d he said. \u201cFifty years later, that dream has come true.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Costa opened Cine LT3, a 35-seat cinema in Sao Paulo. Using his savings and credit card, he spent about 100,000 reais ($18,600) to renovate an old garage, buy vintage wooden seats \u2014 which he found in an old shuttered theater in the countryside \u2014 and transform the space into a movie theater.",
      "The screening room now occupies what was once a studio \u2014 a space behind the garage of his small company that was left idle during the pandemic. Costa, who worked as a TV producer, opened the studios in 2012 and rents them out for screening tests and commercials. Where cars once stood, there are now tables and chairs where moviegoers can wait for their sessions, along with a small counter where he sells popcorn, snacks, soft drinks and wine.",
      "There\u2019s also a small box office where Costa sells tickets to walk-ins. To buy in advance, customers must send him a WhatsApp message to reserve directly.",
      "\u201cThe movie theater is just me. I project the films, make the popcorn, sell the tickets, everything. For economic reasons, I can\u2019t afford an employee,\u201d Costa said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s part of the charm. I know the regulars by name, and that\u2019s what makes this place different.\u201d",
      "Cine LT3 has established itself as a small haven for film lovers, slowly building a loyal neighborhood community and drawing movie buffs with programming that stands apart from the city\u2019s multiplexes.",
      "Costa's independent cinema is also part of a resistance of venues surviving outside the mall circuit. According to 2024 official data, there were only 423 screening rooms in small theaters like LT3 across the country. In contrast, nearly 90% of Brazil\u2019s 3,542 cinema screens operate inside shopping malls.",
      "Some of the country's most traditional stand-alone cinemas now rely on corporate sponsorships to stay open. Many others have shut down and been demolished. In Sao Paulo, where the buildings remain, the former screening rooms have often been repurposed into evangelical churches or adult movie theaters.",
      "Even the venues that survived have faced the threat of closure in recent years. When that happens, local movie lovers often organize protests \u2014 and in some cases, they succeed. That was the case with Cine Belas Artes, located on one of the city\u2019s most iconic corners, at the intersection of Avenida Paulista.",
      "Maria Am\u00e9lia Marcos, a 71-year-old teacher, was visiting LT3 for the first time on Thursday, though she often goes to other independent theaters around Sao Paulo. She believes these venues are essential to preserving the city\u2019s cultural memory.",
      "\u201cIndependent theaters are very important because they have a completely different appeal,\" she said. The film selection is fantastic. I imagine the curators are very thoughtful people who want audiences to see the kind of movies they themselves would love to watch.\u201d",

When The Associated Press visited the theater on Thursday, the schedule included a restored screening of \u201cParis, Texas,\u201d part of a citywide retrospective marking the 80th birthday of German director Wim Wenders.",
      "Ma\u00edda Alves, 63, a regular at LT3, had just left a screening of \u201cParis, Texas\u201d when she spoke with the AP. For her, the venue holds deep emotional value. Having witnessed collective spaces emptying out during the pandemic, she sees the theater as a rare and essential common ground.",
      "\"I think Costa does a really great job,\u201d she said. \u201cI see him selling tickets, making popcorn, cleaning, running the film, answering the phone. That fascinates me. It shows how you have to take initiative to pursue a dream, which I imagine is his life\u2019s dream.\"",
      "Costa often hears people question his decisions, especially from a financial perspective. While he admits the work is challenging, he is happy doing what he loves. And he loves cinema, just like Toto, the protagonist of his favorite movie, \u201cCinema Paradiso,\u201d whom he paid tribute to with a painting on the wall outside LT3.",
      "The character bonds with a local cinema projectionist and, through that relationship, develops a lifelong devotion to movies. Costa said he sees his own life in Toto\u2019s story and believes movies have the power to transform people.",
      "\u201cNo one leaves a movie theater the same way they entered,\u201d he said. Watching people come and go from his theater every day for the past three years, he says he has learned more about human nature.",
      "\u201cFor example, I screen a film, and some people leave crying while others don\u2019t understand it at all. I can see the diversity of human beings,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat affects one person emotionally doesn\u2019t have the same effect on another. I learn something new every day.\u201d",

About 115 kilometers (70 miles) northeast of Mandalay, the country\u2019s second-largest city, it has changed hands twice since the army in 2021 ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, setting off the current civil war between the military government and an alliance of militias representing ethnic minorities and pro-democracy activists.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.",
      "Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.",
      "Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he\u2019s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.",
      "\u201cI thought it was pretty cool, you know \u2014 go from polluting to helping, right?\u201d Cruz said.",
      "Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.",
      "Thousands \u2014 perhaps tens of thousands \u2014 of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.",
      "California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.",
      "State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was \u201ctaking on big oil.\u201d",
      "That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.",
      "California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California\u2019s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.",
      "The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and \u201cin response to market dynamics,\" Phillips 66 said.",
      "The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.",
      "Phillips 66 said it is \u201ccommitted to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.\u201d",
      "Valero announced plans to \u201cidle, restructure or cease refining operations\u201d at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.",
      "Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia\u2019s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a significant and seismic impact to the city,\u201d he said of the planned closure.",

      "Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state\u2019s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.",
      "One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.",
      "Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state \u2014 from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.",
      "But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.",
      "Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villase\u00f1or said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers \u201cand affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.\u201d",
      "Newsom approved $20 million in the state\u2019s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.",
      "California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state\u2019s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they\u2019re able to find work that is important for their communities,\u201d Rizvi said.",
      "But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.",
      "\u201cThe extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there \u2014 because we certainly are not,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.",
      "Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.",
      "But there are downsides.",
      "Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.",
      "Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you feel kind of forgotten.\u201d",

      "Even though the U.S. has a stark shortage of air traffic controllers, ones who call in sick instead of working without a paycheck during the federal government shutdown risk being fired, the U.S. transportation secretary warned.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said this week that he understands the controllers' frustrations and worries. But during an appearance Thursday on Fox Business, he said that by calling in sick they are causing major disruptions to air traffic, and it won't be tolerated.",
      "\u201cIf we have some of our staff that aren\u2019t dedicated like we need, we\u2019ll let them go,\u201d Duffy said, noting that more than 90% of controllers have been showing up to work during the shutdown. \"...

      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syria's foreign minister arrived in Lebanon's capital on Friday in what observers say could mark a breakthrough in relations between the two neighbors, which have been tense for decades.",
      "Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani held talks with his Lebanese counterpart and is expected to meet with President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. It was the first high-profile Syrian visit to Lebanon since insurgent groups overthrew President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in early December 2024.",
      "Lebanon and Syria have been working to rebuild strained ties, focusing on the status of roughly 2,000 Syrian nationals detained in Lebanese prisons, border security, locating Lebanese nationals missing in Syria for years and facilitating the return of Syrian refugees.",
      "The current Syrian leadership resents Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group for taking part in Syria\u2019s civil war, fighting alongside Assad\u2019s forces, while many Lebanese still grudge Syria\u2019s 29-year domination of its smaller neighbor, where it had a military presence for three decades until 2005.",
      "Following their meeting, al-Shibani and Lebanese Foreign Minister Joe Rajji announced at a news conference that the Lebanese-Syrian Higher Council has been suspended and all dealings will be restricted to official diplomatic channels.",
      "Created in 1991, the council symbolized Syria\u2019s influence over Lebanon. Its role declined after Syria\u2019s 2005 withdrawal, the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the 2008 opening of the Syrian Embassy in Beirut, which marked Syria\u2019s first official recognition of Lebanon as an autonomous state since it gained independence from France in 1943. In recent years, the council was largely inactive, with only limited contact between officials.",
      "In early September, a Syrian delegation, which included two former Cabinet ministers and the head of Syria\u2019s National Commission for Missing Persons, visited Beirut. Lebanon and Syria also agreed at the time to establish two committees to address outstanding key issues.",

      "Meanwhile, Lebanon hosts an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees who fled the uprising-turned-civil war that erupted more than 14 years ago. Since Assad\u2019s fall in December, around 850,000 refugees have returned to Syria from neighboring countries as of September, with the number expected to rise, according to UNHCR Deputy High Commissioner Kelly T. Clements. Lebanese authorities granted an exemption to Syrians staying illegally if they left by the end of August.",
      "Syria\u2019s conflict, which began in March 2011, has killed nearly 500,000 people and displaced half the country\u2019s prewar population of 23 million. More than 5 million Syrians fled the country as refugees, most of them to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, which has the highest number of refugees per capita in the world.",
      "Although many Syrians initially hoped for stability after Assad was ousted, sectarian killings against members of Assad\u2019s Alawite minority sect in Syria\u2019s coastal region in March and against the Druze minority in the southern province of Sweida in July claimed hundreds of lives and revived security concerns.",
      "Meanwhile, the Lebanon-Syria border has long been a flashpoint for clashes, with periodic exchanges of fire and infiltration attempts, particularly in the northeastern Bekaa Valley. In March 2025, the two countries signed an agreement to demarcate the border and enhance security coordination, aiming to prevent disputes and curb smuggling and other illicit activities.",
      "Hezbollah has been heavily involved in cross-border smuggling, primarily to move weapons and military supplies, leading to tensions and violent confrontations along the border. Syrian security forces have repeatedly intercepted Hezbollah-linked trucks carrying weapons into Lebanon.",
      "Since the fall of Assad, two Lebanese prime ministers have visited Syria. Aoun and Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa also held talks on the sidelines of an Arab summit in Egypt in March.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister on Friday to break a political deadlock",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 After a week of intense political turmoil, French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister Friday in his latest bid to break the political deadlock that has gripped the country for more than a year, as France struggles with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as the president\u2019s last chance to revive his second term, which runs until 2027. With no majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces increasingly fierce criticism, even from within his own camp, and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu abruptly resigned Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor within 48 hours.",
      "Over the past year, Macron\u2019s successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France\u2019s poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",

      "Macron may turn to a figure from the left, which managed to form a coalition in the 2024 legislative elections, or opt for a technocratic government to sidestep partisan deadlock.",
      "In any case, the new prime minister will have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon the pension reform that gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Macron fought fiercely for the deeply unpopular measure, which was enacted into law in 2023 despite mass protests.",
      "Lecornu argued that Macron\u2019s centrist bloc, its allies, and parts of the opposition could still rally to form a working majority. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority that can govern,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\u201d",
      "The stalemate stems from Macron\u2019s shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France\u2019s spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron\u2019s governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu\u2019s resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president\u2019s coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries.",

      "The speech will come more than a week after protesters sent a letter of demands sent directly to the palace, thrusting the king into the spotlight and upending the careful distance he usually maintains from public debate.

      "A family that runs two costume stores in Chicago is putting a creative twist on Halloween this year due to tariffs on Chinese imports",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 With Halloween on the horizon, Chicago Costume is stuffed. Packaged costumes, including superheros and Japanese animation characters in both kid and adult sizes, dangle near colorful wigs and bottles of fake blood. Downstairs, vintage clothes from the 1970s beg for one more boogie night.",
      "The frightening possibilities mask the work that\u2019s gone on behind the scenes to stock the family-owned shop and its sister store for the spooky season. Owner Courtland Hickey said he ordered 40% fewer costumes this year because of President Donald Trump's tariffs on products from China.",
      "To fill the gap, Hickey and his mother, Chicago Costume founder Mary Hickey Panayotou, looked to their decade's worth of unsold costumes and accessories to see what could be repackaged or repurposed. The tariffs made new imports more expensive, and storewide price increases might spook customers, he said.",
      "\u201cIf people have less money in their pocket to spend, ... then costumes are going to be lower on their list,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cSo the more we have to invest in new products, the riskier it is for the business because we aren\u2019t going to sell it.\u201d",
      "Tapping the old inventory required sorting through several thousand items stored in backrooms and a warehouse. Vintage pieces once reserved for rentals combined with fresh items became sets. A surplus of black robes became the foundation for Halloween wizards, judges, choir members and graduating students, Hickey said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a staple piece that gets transformed by the accessories we pair with them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of Chicago Costume's 35 employees also got busy sewing fabric scraps and foam material into imitations of the miter headdresses worn by high-ranking Catholic clergy. Paired with a robe, the headwear would let someone dress up as Pope Leo, a Chicago native.",
      "Panayotou founded Chicago Costume in 1976 by custom-designing and renting costumes for the Windy City\u2019s theater companies. It fast became a destination for non-actors looking for Halloween outfits.",
      "Commercially made children\u2019s costumes followed, and a stockpile of capes, masquerade masks, \u201cStar Wars\u201d kits and other leftovers grew from there.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of a hoarder,\u201d Panayotou said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to throw stuff away. So there\u2019s a lot of accessory items and pieces. Here\u2019s the dress, but we have only one glove.\u201d",
      "Having excess inventory typically is avoided in retail, but the practice has given Chicago Costume a supply cushion during what has been an unpredictable 2025 for import-reliant segments of the industry, including toy manufacturers and stores.",
      "Hickey said tariffs weren't on his radar until he and and other Chicago Costume staff members met with suppliers at the Halloween & Party Expo in January. Whether Trump would impose duties on Chinese goods after his inauguration the following week was a big topic of conversation at the Las Vegas event, he said.",
      "On Feb. 1, the president signed the first tariff order of his second term. Hickey already had ordered his usual number of new costumes but put fulfillment and delivery on hold when the tariff rate on imports from China ballooned to 145% in April. Nearly 90% of the costumes Chicago Costume sells in stores and online are made in China, in line with the costume industry average, he said.",
      "Some suppliers already had products ready and said they would not charge him extra, Hickey said. Others said he would have to pay more to cover the cost of tariffs. \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d he recalls being told. \u201cI pretty much left it.\u201d",
      "Other small businesses that rely on Halloween describe similar their own tariff-related woes. Trick or Treat Studios, which designs masks based on characters from popular horror movies as well as costumes and props, laid off 15 employees, one-fourth of its staff, in May, co-founder Christopher Zephro said.",
      "Zephro uses factories in China to make plastic masks but said he is reducing the amount of work done there and shifting it to Mexico, where his latex masks are manufactured. In the meantime, he raised prices by 15%.",

      "At Chicago Costume, which generates well under $1 million dollars in annual sales, shoppers will see fewer sales promotions and discounts, Hickey said. Children\u2019s costumes of officially licensed characters and bulky sets will cost at least 25% more, he said. A lederhosen costume, for example, is priced at $49.99, or $10 more that it did a year ago.",
      "Hickey, who has served on the board of the National Costumers Association for 20 years, initially saw a silver lining in Trump's tariffs. Big retail chains have siphoned sales from independent costume shops with the help of cheap costumes from China, he said.",
      "In May, Hickey published a column on the National Costumers Association's website that outlined Chicago Costume's can-do, environmentally superior approach this year. He hoped it would galvanize the trade group's 100 independent store members \u2014 a group that numbered 220 a decade ago \u2014 to dust off old stock, reorganize their shops and prepare for \u201ca potentially great Halloween.\u201d",
      "Tariffs have \u201cpeeled back the curtain on just how deep our reliance on cheap overseas manufacturing has become,\" he wrote. \u201cIf this shift hurts Amazon dropshippers, Spirit Halloween, or Walmart\u2019s over-imported costume lines, I\u2019m not going to mourn. In fact, I see it as a chance for us to reclaim what made local retail special.\"",
      "Some of Hickey's idealism has since faded. The impact of tariffs on Halloween played out differently than he expected. The largest retail chains doubled down, flooding the market with cheap costumes and dropping prices to hold onto customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot harder than I hoped, but I still believe that optimism, adaptability, and differentiation are what will keep independent costume shops like us alive,\u201d he said.",
      "Chicago Costume is used to embracing challenges. To keep revenue flowing year-round, the stores cater to cosplay fans and themed parties. The Hickey-Panayotou family has a separate business making mascot costumes for the Chicago Bulls and other professional sports teams, and acquired a theatrical services company founded in 1886 along with its collection of period pieces.",
      "Diversifying made it easier to rotate and refurbish old stock instead of slashing prices after Halloween or throwing pieces away, he said.",
      "For a customer who wanted to be a Hollywood diva, his wife, Erin, who handles social media for Chicago Costume, paired a robe trimmed with feather boas from the vintage collection with a new cigarette holder, hat and pair of sunglasses. Total cost: $65.",
      "Damien Johnson, 53, is a longtime Chicago Costume patron whose birthday is Oct. 31. He has spent as much as $300 on his Halloween getups and said he would never shop online or at discount stores.",
      "Despite his loyalty, Johnson delayed his costume-buying by a month this year. He also gave himself a spending cap. Transforming himself into the clown-faced Pennywise character from Stephen King\u2019s \u201cIt\u201d will come to $90, including hair and makeup.",
      "\u201cI always overbought.\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, I am good.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Prince Harry and Meghan Markle urged parents to stand against social media companies that they said prey upon children with exploitative algorithms as the \u201cexplosion of unregulated artificial intelligence\u201d adds to their concerns that technologies' benefits are inseparable from its dangers.",
      "To underscore that point, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex cited research from advocacy group ParentsTogether that found researchers posing as children experienced harmful interactions every five minutes they spent with an artificial intelligence chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t content created by a third party. These were the companies\u2019 own chatbots working to advance their own depraved internal policies,\" said Prince Harry at Spring Studios in Manhattan Thursday night as he and Markle were named Humanitarians of the Year by the nonprofit Project Healthy Minds. \"But here\u2019s what gives us hope: these families aren\u2019t facing this alone.\u201d",
      "To build their movement of families fighting for online safety, the couple also announced Thursday that their foundation's Parents Network would join forces with ParentsTogether.",
      "Their remarks came at the annual gala for Project Healthy Minds, a Millennial- and Gen Z-driven tech nonprofit that runs a free online marketplace aiming to connect patients with the exact mental health care they seek.",
      "The couple has made youth mental health a cornerstone of their philanthropic work since launching the Archewell Foundation in 2020 after stepping aside as working royals. Through its network for families who have experienced online harm and support of youth-led organizations shaping responsible technology, the nonprofit works to make digital spaces safer.",
      "Prince Harry has previously stressed the need to hold powerful social media companies accountable. He warned last year that young people are experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of anxiety, depression and social isolation driven by negative experiences online.",
      "According to numerous studies, few guardrails exist to mitigate kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content including pornography and violence on social media, where they also face cyberbullying and sexual harassment.",
      "The issue could also be considered personal for the couple. Markle has been open about her mental health struggles due to what she describes as the royal family\u2019s intense pressures and tabloid attacks. Harry's own personal life has been the subject of much tabloid reporting, including targeted phone hacking and surveillance.",
      "Prince Harry brought his awareness campaign to a reception Wednesday night hosted by men's health nonprofit Movember. In a conversation with television journalist Brooke Baldwin, he emphasized that men should not feel isolated because he repeatedly hears the same struggles when he speaks with them.",
      "\u201cThe biggest barrier is the belief that no one will understand,\u201d he said in comments reshared on his blog. \"Loneliness convinces you you\u2019re the only one, which is rarely true.\u201d",
      "\u201cCulture makers\u201d such as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are important voices in mental health conversations because they inspire their enormous audiences to seek care, according to Project Healthy Minds CEO Phil Schermer.",

      "Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.",
      "The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president\u2019s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.",
      "The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.",
      "Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.",
      "The road was approved in Trump\u2019s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.",
      "The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.",
      "Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.",
      "A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.",
      "Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive \u201cstronger participation\u201d in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a \u201cdecades long war on coal\u201d by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was \u201cputting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.\u201d",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to prevent the state\u2019s plan that provides insurance to homeowners who can\u2019t get private coverage from running out of money",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bipartisan bill Thursday that aims to prevent the state's home insurer of last resort from running out of money following a natural disaster.",
      "The FAIR Plan is an insurance pool that provides policies to people who can\u2019t get private insurance because their properties are deemed too risky to insure. The number of homeowners forced onto the FAIR Plan has skyrocketed. With high premiums and basic coverage, the plan is designed as a temporary option until homeowners can find permanent coverage.",
      "But more Californians are relying on it than ever as increasingly devastating and destructive fires spark across the state, including in densely populated areas. There were nearly 600,000 home policies on the FAIR Plan as of June. Leaders of the plan last year warned state lawmakers that it could go insolvent after a major wildfire or disaster.",
      "That reality came true earlier this year after wildfires swept through Los Angeles and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. The plan faced a loss of roughly $4 billion and needed a $1 billion bailout from private insurers to pay out claims. Half of that cost is expected to be passed onto all policyholders.",
      "The law Newsom signed allows the FAIR Plan to request state-backed loans and bonds and spread out claims payments over multiple years after a disaster. Insurance companies were previously required to pay the full bailout within 30 days. Supporters of the new law said it will prevent the need for future bailouts that raise rates for everyone.",
      "\u201cThe kinds of climate-fueled firestorms like we saw in January will only continue to worsen over time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking action now to continue strengthening California\u2019s insurance market to be more resilient in the face of the climate crisis,\" Newsom said in a statement.",

      "Newsom also signed another bill to expand the FAIR Plan board, which currently consists of nine voting insurers and four nonvoting members appointed by the governor. The new law adds two representatives from the Legislature to serve as non-voting members on the board.",
      "Supporters, including the state\u2019s top insurance regulator, said the law adds a new layer of oversight and transparency. Opponents said it wouldn't make a difference because the new members don't have any voting power.",
      "California is undergoing a yearslong effort to stabilize its insurance market after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in 2023, which pushed hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan. Wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in California because of climate change, and insurers say that is making it difficult to truly price the risk on properties.",
      "Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 15 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",
      "The state now gives insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes regulations allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.",

      "SHANGHAI -- SHANGHAI (AP) \u2014 Jeeno Thitikul came from four shots down with five holes to play to force a playoff with Minami Katsu, before producing another extraordinary shot on the fifth playoff hole to claim the LPGA Shanghai and become the first two-time LPGA tournament winner of the season on Sunday.",
      "Top-ranked Thitikul's 63 was the round of the day and included seven birdies and an eagle. The Thai player's 24-under 264 closed what had appeared to be a comfortable margin for overnight leader Katsu of Japan, who had started the day two shots ahead and extended that to four after the 13th.",
      "But the Thai player reeled that in with birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th, before an incredible eagle with the ball bouncing along the mottled 17th green of Qizhong Garden Golf Club in Shanghai to draw level.",
      "Katsu (65) could only respond with a birdie of her own at the 17th, but had another birdie chance on the final hole to claw back the victory only for the ball to slide past the hole and forcing the playoff.",
      "Pars through the first four playoff holes, rotated between the 18th and the 10th, included Katsu having two birdie putts to win only to narrowly miss the hole on both.",
      "On the fifth playoff hole the deadlock was broken as a brilliant approach by Thitikul placed the ball three feet away, while Katsu's second shot fell short of the green at the par-4 18th.",
      "Katsu's chip for birdie was impressive but missed, leaving Thitikul a simple birdie putt to close out a remarkable victory nearly two years after losing in an epic nine-hole playoff to Celine Boutier at the LPGA Malaysia.",
      "It was Thitikul's second win of the season after claiming the Mizuho Americas Open in May and helped ease the disappointment of her inexplicable four-putt meltdown on the final hole at the Kroger Queen City Championship last month.",

      "YOKOHAMA, Japan -- YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) \u2014 Xander Schauffele picked up another meaningful win in Japan, this one a PGA Tour trophy instead of Olympic gold, capping a frustrated year marked by injury and some doubt.",
      "Schauffele birdied the 17th hole Sunday and closed with a 7-under 64 to hold off Max Greyserman and win the Baycurrent Classic. It caps off a season that saw him miss two months with a rib injury and fail to reach the Tour Championship for the first time.",
      "\u201cThis is really special for me \u2014 sooner than I thought, to be fair,\u201d Schauffele said. \u201cI was running out of events in 2025 to sort of put my mark on it. I\u2019m sure when I look back on 2025 at the end of my career I\u2019ll smile and think it was a great year.\u201d",
      "It was a great year off the course \u2014 his wife gave birth to their first child, Victor, in late August. But it was a struggle to regain his form after missing two months at the start of the year, coming off a season when he won the PGA Championship and British Open.",
      "And it was only fitting that he won in Japan, where his mother and mother-in-law were raised.",
      "Schauffele finished at 19-under 265 at Yokohama Country Club and was one shot ahead of American Max Greyserman, who also was the runner-up at this event a year ago as he chases his first PGA Tour title.",
      "Greyserman (65) fell two shots behind when Schauffele birdied the 17th hole. Needing to hole out from 190 yards to have any chance, Greyserman hit 7-iron that settled a few inches from the cup and left him a tap-in birdie.",
      "Schauffele's biggest win in Japan was the Olympic gold medal in 2021, though he had no support in the gallery because of the COVID-19 restrictions.",
      "His maternal grandparents live in Japan. His mother was born in Taiwan and grew up in Japan. His wife's mother grew up in Japan\u2019s southern island of Okinawa.",

      "Schauffele was cheered during the tournament by family members who attended, including his 81-year-old grandmother who walked the course with him. He said there would probably be a get-together with family members later to celebrate.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Andrew Vaughn and Jacob Misiorowski were both in the minor leagues with separate organizations at the start of June, one on the way up and the other on the way down.",
      "Four months later, they played key roles in helping the Milwaukee Brewers reach the National League Championship Series.",
      "Vaughn hit a tiebreaking homer in the fourth inning that put Milwaukee ahead for good Saturday night in its 3-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs in the decisive Game 5 of their NL Division Series. Misiorowski earned his second win of the series by allowing just one run over four innings in relief.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d Misiorowski said during the Brewers\u2019 clubhouse celebration. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I\u2019ve worked for, and it\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Their arrivals in Milwaukee were indirectly connected.",
      "When Misiorowski was promoted from the minor leagues in June, he took Aaron Civale\u2019s spot in Milwaukee\u2019s rotation. Civale reacted to the bullpen assignment by saying he wouldn\u2019t mind getting traded to a team that would allow him to continue starting.",
      "The Brewers then sent Civale to the Chicago White Sox in a deal that brought them Vaughn. Civale ended up finishing the season with the Cubs, and he pitched 4 1/3 shutout innings in this series.",
      "At the time of the trade, there was little reason to believe Vaughn would become a major factor for Milwaukee this season. He had batted .189 with a .218 on-base percentage and .314 slugging percentage in 48 games with the White Sox, who eventually sent him to the minor leagues. The Brewers initially kept him in the minors after acquiring him.",
      "But he got called back up to the majors July 7 after Brewers first baseman Rhys Hoskins went on the injured list with a sprained left thumb. Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy greeted Vaughn by letting him know he would probably get sent right back to the minors if he continued chasing pitches outside the strike zone.",
      "Vaughn homered off Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto in his first at-bat with the Brewers and improved his chase rate in making a remarkable transformation. He batted .308 with a .375 on-base percentage and .493 slugging percentage in 64 games with Milwaukee.",
      "\u201cThis guy\u2019s a gamer,\u201d Brewers president of baseball operations Matt Arnold said. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot, and he\u2019s failed, just like all of us. We\u2019ve all failed in this sport. If you haven\u2019t, you haven\u2019t been doing it long enough. So we\u2019ve all failed. For that guy to come in here and be himself and put the team on his back at times this year is really awesome.\u201d",
      "Vaughn offered simple reasons for his dramatic improvement.",
      "\u201cChange of scenery, being around some different coaches, different stuff and just playing free,\u201d he said.",
      "Vaughn put the Brewers ahead Saturday by connecting on a 3-2 pitch from Colin Rea and hitting a 383-foot drive over the left-field wall with two outs in the fourth. That cleared the way for Misiorowski to earn the Game 5 win.",

      "Then the rookie went on the injured lift with a left tibia bruise. He returned in mid-August but allowed 22 runs over 32 2/3 innings the rest of the season, a slump that led to concern about how much the Brewers could trust the excitable right-hander in a postseason setting.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t easy on him,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI didn\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to pump him up. I wanted to find out what he had, because I knew with that kind of stuff, he could really help us.\u201d",

      "Misiorowski threw three shutout innings in a Game 2 victory while reaching a peak velocity of 104.3 mph and hitting at least 100 mph on 31 of his 57 pitches. Misiorowski entered in the second inning of Game 5 and immediately gave up a tying homer to Seiya Suzuki, but the 23-year-old silenced the Cubs from there.",

      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",

      "KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books that allow election officials to confirm voter information, announced the deal and the name change. In a possible nod to a groundless conspiracy theory that linked Dominion to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, the release highlighted that the company would become \u201c100% American-owned.\u201d",
      "The announcement also quotes KNOWiNK's owner, former St. Louis elections director Scott Leiendecker, as vowing to provide \u201celection technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency,\u201d one of the longtime demands of election conspiracy theorists.

Level 2 driver-assistance software, or \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised),\u201d requires drivers to pay full attention to the road.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La Nina, the cooler and at times costlier flip side of El Nino, has arrived to warp weather worldwide, meteorologists said Thursday. This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",
      "The conditions, especially wind shear, favor more hurricane activity, yet it's not happening and long-range computer models don't show much forming for the next couple weeks, said Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach.",

      "Financial institutions are raising concerns about a potential AI investment bubble",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Lingering doubts about the economic promise of artificial intelligence technology are starting to get the attention of financial institutions that raised warning flags this week about an AI investment bubble.",
      "Officials at the Bank of England on Wednesday flagged the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst.",
      "\u201cThe risk of a sharp market correction has increased,\u201d the U.K. central bank said.",
      "The head of the International Monetary Fund raised a similar alarm hours after the Bank of England\u2019s report.",
      "Global stock prices have been surging, fired up by \u201coptimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.",
      "But financial conditions could \u201cturn abruptly,\u201d she warned in a speech ahead of the organization\u2019s annual meeting next week in Washington.",
      "\u201cBubbles obviously are never very easy to identify, but we can see there are a few potential symptoms of a bubble in the current situation,\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "Those symptoms include rapid growth in tech stock prices, the fact that tech stocks now comprise about 40% of the S&P 500, market valuations that appear \u201cstretched\u201d beyond their worth and \u201ca general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield,\u201d Slater said.",
      "The most optimistic projections about the fruits of generative AI products foresee a transformation of the economy, leading to annual productivity gains that Slater says have not been seen since the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. At the lower end, economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has predicted a \u201cnontrivial but modest\u201d U.S. productivity gain of just 0.7% over a decade.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,\u201d Slater said. \u201cNobody really knows where it\u2019s going to land.\u201d",
      "Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power these AI products.",
      "OpenAI doesn't turn a profit but the privately held San Francisco firm is now the world's most valuable startup, with a market valuation of $500 billion. It recently signed major deals with chipmaker Nvidia, the world's most valuable publicly traded company, and its rival AMD.",
      "The Bank of England didn't name any specific companies but said that on \u201ca number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence.\u201d",
      "The report said stock market valuations are \u201ccomparable to the peak\u201d of the 2000 dotcom bubble, which then deflated and led to a recession. With tech stocks accounting for an increasingly large share of benchmark stock indexes, stock markets are \u201cparticularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.\u201d",
      "The bank outlined so-called downside risks, including shortages of electricity, data or chips that could slow AI progress, or technological changes that could lessen the need for the type of AI infrastructure currently being built around the world.",
      "The IMF's Georgieva said current stock valuations \u201care heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth,\u201d she said.",

      "The U.S. government shutdown could raise a caution flag for private companies considering a move to the public market for investors",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The U.S. government shutdown is waving a caution flag at private companies racing to make the move to the public market.",
      "The market for initial public offerings has been on a years-long recovery after spiking inflation slammed the brakes on activity in 2022. The IPO market is already on track for its best year since 2021 with 163 deals and $31 billion in proceeds raised so far, according to Renaissance Capital.",
      "Companies rely on the U.S. government, through the Securities and Exchange Commission, to review and approve IPO filings, while monitoring the ongoing process. The SEC is now operating with minimal staff, significantly delaying or halting those reviews and approvals.",
      "Investors and companies are dealing with more than just technical issues. A prolonged government shutdown could sap confidence in the U.S. markets and economy. IPO activity typically remains strong through October, then slows in the U.S. during the final two months of the year.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s always an end of the year factor,\" said Samuel Kerr, head of global equity capital markets at Mergermarket.",
      "Investors and companies had been mostly brushing off much of the uncertainty roiling the U.S. government and economy through the year, including an unpredictable trade policy, ongoing worries about inflation, a weakening job market and questions about Federal Reserve policy. Amid all that, the stock market has notched record after record and new companies keep joining the ranks.",
      "The impasse in Washington, though, has brought a reminder of the challenges facing the market.",
      "\u201cIt (the shutdown) reminds you that we\u2019re not operating in normal times,\u201d Kerr said.",
      "Investors have been drawn to IPOs because stocks have looked pricey for a while, especially in the technology sector, leaving them looking for other ways to get into the market. IPOs have offered a way to do that. Many of the bigger IPOs in 2025 have been in growing technology fields, including cryptocurrency technology and artificial intelligence.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday for research on the weird world of sub-atomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.",
      "One of the winners said that quantum mechanics research already has wound up in our everyday communications. Speaking from his cellphone, Clarke said: \u201cOne of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.\u2019\u2019",
      "Clarke, 83, conducted his research at the University of California, Berkeley; Martinis, 67, at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and Devoret, 72, is at Yale and also at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Clarke, who spearheaded the research team, told The Associated Press he was \"pleased to receive this prize'' alongside his two colleagues.",
      "Martinis\u2019 wife, Jean, told Associated Press reporters who called at his home some two-and-a-half hours after the announcement that he was still asleep and did not yet know. She said in the past they had stayed up on the night of the physics award, but at some point they decided that sleep was more important.",
      "AP reporters were later able to speak with Martinis, once his wife decided it was late enough to wake him up.",
      "Devoret could not immediately be contacted.",
      "The prize winning research in the mid-1980s took the sub-atomic \u201cweirdness of quantum mechanics\u201d and found how those tiny interactions can have real world applications on the human scale level, said Jonathan Bagger, CEO of the American Physical Society. They have the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on-and-off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers.",
      "What the three physicists did \u201cis taking the scale of something that we can\u2019t see, we can\u2019t touch, we can\u2019t feel and bringing it up to the scale of something recognizable and make it something you can build upon,\u201d said Physics Today editor-in-chief Richard Fitzgerald, who in the 1990s worked in the field on a competitors\u2019 group.",
      "The work is a crucial building block in the fast-developing world of quantum mechanics.",
      "\u201cQuantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they\u2019re also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\u201d Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "Quantum computing when fully achieved would be a large leap from what we now know, scientists said.",
      "Clarke said the research \u201cin some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me.\u201d",
      "Both Bagger and Fitzgerald said it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say our everyday cellphones now use the breakthrough made by Clarke and colleagues. But ultra-sensitive measuring devices rely on that team\u2019s work and while we could have magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) without their work, it makes it far more sensitive and useful, Bagger said.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.",

      "\u201cI might say, \u2019Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I\u2019m going to send them Tomahawks,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Israel. \u201cThe Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.\u201d",
      "Trump also said, \"I might tell them that if the war is not settled -- that we may very well.\" He added, \"We may not, but we may do it. I think it\u2019s appropriate to bring up.\u201d",
      "His comments came after Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Trump said he mentioned possibly sending Tomahawks during that conversation.",
      "\u201cDo they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cI think I might speak to Russia about that.\u201d He added that \u201cTomahawks are a new step of aggression.\u201d",
      "His suggestions followed Russia having attacked Ukraine\u2019s power grid overnight, part of an ongoing campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter. Moscow also expressed \u201cextreme concern\u201d over the U.S. potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.",
      "Putin himself has previously suggested that the United States supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington.",
      "For his part, Zelenskyy described his latest call with Trump as \u201cvery productive,\u201d and said the pair had discussed strengthening Ukraine\u2019s \u201cair defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities,\u201d along with \u201cdetails related to the energy sector.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cThe Sunday Briefing\u201d after his call with Trump, Zelenskyy was asked whether Trump had approved the Tomahawks and said, \u201cwe work on it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m waiting for president to yes,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cOf course we count on such decisions, but we will see. We will see.\u201d",

    "summary": "Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago",
    "story": [
      "Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago, when it helped sink then-Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. Yet you wouldn't know it from listening to President Donald Trump or even some of the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.",
      "Trump told the United Nations General Assembly late last month: \u201cGrocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down, and inflation has been defeated.\u201d",
      "And at a high-profile speech in August, just before the Fed cut its key interest rate for the first time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said: \u201cInflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. Upside risks to inflation have diminished.\u201d",
      "Yet dismissing or even downplaying inflation while it is still above the Fed's target of 2% poses big risks for the White House and the Federal Reserve. For the Trump administration, it could find itself on the wrong side of a potent issue: Surveys show that many Americans still see high prices as a major burden on their finances.",
      "The Fed may be taking an even bigger gamble: It has cut its key interest rate on the assumption that the Trump administration's tariffs will only cause a temporary bump up in inflation. If that turns out to be wrong \u2014 if inflation gets worse or remains elevated for longer than expected \u2014 the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility could take a hit.",
      "That credibility plays a crucial role in the Fed's ability to keep prices stable. If Americans are confident that the central bank can keep inflation in check, they won't take steps \u2014 such as demanding sharply higher pay when prices rise \u2014 that can launch an inflationary spiral. Companies often increase prices further to offset higher labor costs.",
      "But Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said this week that with memories of pandemic-era inflation still fresh and tariffs pushing up the cost of imported goods, consumers and businesses could start to lose confidence that inflation will stay low.",
      "\u201cIf that proves to be the case, in hindsight it will be that the Fed cuts -- and I do expect several more -- are going to be seen as a mistake,\u201d Dynan said.",
      "So far, the Trump administration's tariffs haven't lifted inflation as much as as many economists expected earlier this year. And it remains far below its 9.1% peak three years ago. Still, consumer prices increased 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.6% at the same time last year and above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "The government is scheduled to release the September inflation report on Wednesday, but the data will probably be delayed by the government shutdown.",
      "Tariffs have pushed up the cost of many imported items, including furniture, appliances, and toys. Overall, the cost of long-lasting manufactured goods rose nearly 2% in August from a year earlier. It was a modest gain, but comes after nearly three decades when the cost of such items mostly fell.",
      "The cost of some everyday goods are still rising more quickly than before the pandemic: Grocery prices moved up 2.7% in August from a year ago, the largest gain, outside the pandemic, since 2015. Coffee prices have soared nearly 21% in the past year, partly because Trump has slapped 50% import taxes on Brazil, a leading coffee exporter, and also because climate change-induced droughts have cut into coffee bean harvests.",
      "Most Fed officials are still concerned that inflation is too high, according the minutes of its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Yet they still chose to cut their key interest rate, because they were more worried about the risk of worsening unemployment than about higher inflation.",

      "But the concern for some economists is that the ongoing rollout of tariffs and the fact that many companies are still implementing price hikes in response could result in more than just a temporary boost to inflation.",
      "\u201cIt is a big gamble after what we\u2019ve been going through ... to count on it being transitory,\u201d said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cOnce upon a time, (3% inflation) would have been considered really high.\u201d",
      "Just two weeks ago, Trump slapped new tariffs on a range of products, including 100% on pharmaceuticals, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 25% on heavy trucks. On Friday, he threatened \u201ca massive increase of tariffs\u201d on imports from China in response to that country's restrictions on rare earth exports.",
      "Some companies are still raising prices to offset the tariff costs. Duties on steel and aluminum imports have pushed up the cost of the cans used by Campbell Soups, leading the company\u2019s CEO to say in September that it will implement \u201csurgical pricing initiatives.\"",
      "Chris Butler, CEO of National Tree Company, the nation\u2019s largest artificial Christmas tree seller, says his company will raise prices by about 10% this holiday season on its trees, wreaths, and garlands to offset tariff costs. About 45% of its trees are made in China, with the rest from Southeast Asia, Mexico, and other countries. The cost of labor and real estate is too high to make them in the United States, he said.",
      "Butler also expects there will be a reduced supply of artificial trees and decorations this year, which could lift industry-wide prices further, because most production in China shut down when tariffs on that country hit 145% earlier this year. Production resumed after Trump reduced the duties to 30% but at a slower pace.",
      "Butler has pushed his suppliers to absorb some of the cost of the tariffs, but they won\u2019t pay all of it.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we can\u2019t absorb the entirety of it and our factories can\u2019t absorb the entirety of it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to pass along some of the increases to consumers.\u201d",
      "Many Fed policymakers are aware of the risks. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who votes on interest rate decisions, said Monday that high inflation that results from a loss of confidence in the central bank is harder to fight than other price spikes, such as those that result from supply disruptions.",
      "\u201cThe Fed must maintain its credibility on inflation,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cHistory has shown that while all inflations are universally disliked, not all inflations are equally costly to fight.\u201d",
      "Yet some Fed officials say that other trends are offsetting the impact of tariffs. Fed governor Stephen Miran, whom Trump appointed just before the central bank\u2019s September meeting, said Tuesday that a steady slowdown in rental costs should reduce underlying inflation in the coming months. And the sharp drop in immigration as a result of the administration\u2019s clampdown will reduce demand, he said, cooling inflation pressures.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more sanguine about the inflation outlook than a lot of other people are,\u201d he said.",

      "The indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James on allegations of mortgage fraud has raised alarms among her allies and Black leaders, who condemned it as a politicization of the justice system for President Donald Trump's personal grievances",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The coalition of New York NAACP chapters had just begun its annual state convention when Letitia James, a longtime member and the state's attorney general, canceled her appearance.",
      "James had just been indicted by the Justice Department for alleged mortgage fraud, a charge which she called \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201ca grave violation of our constitutional order.\u201d",
      "For the New York convention's organizers, the moment was alarming and underscored the gathering's importance, which featured multiple sessions on building political power at the state level in response to what NAACP leaders called federal attacks on social welfare, civil rights and the rule of law.",
      "\u201cIt was through our collective action that a democracy was built,\u201d said NAACP New York State Conference President L. Joy Williams. \u201cWhat we have to do is not only defend against what is happening now, but we have to push further past where we were before, to build a system to build a better American democracy that we all deserve.\u201d",
      "The indictment of James, who had previously prosecuted the Trump Organization for business fraud, immediately sparked debate over whether the justice system had been politicized for President Donald Trump's personal grievances. It also drew many parallels with the recent effort by Trump to remove a Federal Reserve Board governor, Lisa Cook, from her post over similar allegations.",
      "Advocates see some of Trump's recent moves as exceptionally targeted at Black women leaders.",
      "\u201cThis is something that we\u2019ve been grappling with since the start of this administration,\u201d said Shavon Arline-Bradley, president and CEO of the National Council of Negro Women, the country\u2019s oldest civil rights organization for Black women.",
      "The claims also have symbolic weight to Black families, Arline-Bradley said, where property ownership has historically been restricted by the legal system through outright and implicit discrimination.",
      "Homeownership has since become a disproportionate \u2014 and sometimes sole \u2014 avenue of wealth creation for Black Americans. And a recent national survey shows a widening of the racial wealth gap between white and Black individuals, even as income has increased for Black workers.",
      "\u201cWhen you attack someone\u2019s home, you attack their ability to own, you attack their ability to have choice, you have attacked their ability to make a statement about their economic future,\u201d Arline-Bradley said. \u201cThis is a consistent pattern that has highlighted what they think is an Achilles' heel in the Black community.\u201d",
      "Black women, Arline-Bradley added, \u201cfeel very targeted\u201d because of the president\u2019s words and actions, which she said was rooted in \u201ca misunderstanding about the accomplishments and leadership of these women.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration contends its prosecution of James over alleged mortgage fraud is justified and impartial.",
      "\u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d Lindsey Halligan, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cThe charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public\u2019s trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is very uncommon for prosecutors to bring these sorts of claims absent a pattern of malicious activity or evidence that the individual has actually harmed the bank by not paying their mortgage or if it\u2019s part of a much larger fraudulent scheme,\u201d said Paul Schiff Berman, a professor of law at the George Washington University School of Law.",
      "For James, Berman said, \u201cthe claim is that she said that the house was going to be used as her second home but she also used it as a rental property sometimes,\" which Berman said could be argued as a reasonable use for a second home and likely not in violation of a typical mortgage contract.",

      "\"While we are responding in this moment, this is also happening to her, and so we want to give her space,\" said Williams, the New York NAACP leader. \u201cAnd the thing about home is you can always go there. So we know she\u2019ll always come back.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Former first lady Michelle Obama is putting new force behind efforts to ensure girls overcome educational barriers in some of the world's most economically disadvantaged areas.",
      "The Obama Foundation's Girls Opportunity Alliance pledged Saturday to rally $2.5 million for dozens of grassroots groups who advance adolescent girls' education by covering school-related costs, challenging patriarchal practices such as child marriage, counseling survivors of sexual abuse and providing other forms of support.",
      "\u201cThese groups are changing the way girls see themselves in their own communities and in our world, helping create the leaders we need for the brighter future we all deserve,\" Obama said in a video released Oct. 11, the International Day of the Girl. \"Because when our girls succeed, we all do.\u201d",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the 119 million girls out of school worldwide are of secondary school-age, according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Girls Opportunity Alliance \u2014 an outgrowth of an Obama White House initiative that invested $1 billion in U.S. government programs promoting adolescent girls' education abroad \u2014 launched in 2018 with a focus on helping that population between ages 10-19 graduate.",
      "But the latest announcement comes amid stark warnings from international aid groups that budget cuts will roll back recent progress. UNICEF projects that a 24% drop in wealthy countries' global education funding will push six million girls out of school by the end of next year.",
      "\u201cThe need right now, I think more than ever, is crucial,\" Girls Opportunity Alliance Executive Director Tiffany Drake said. \"We were just in Mauritius and we heard it time and time again that organizations need funding. They need support.\u201d",
      "Girls Opportunity Alliance's early October convening in Mauritius brought together Asian and African members of its network. The great demands on local leaders doing tireless work with little resources made it, in Drake's view, perhaps the most moving gathering they've hosted.",

A recipient of GOA's latest grants, she said the Obama Foundation's endorsement not only brings financial support, but increased trust from the international community and additional channels to get resources.",
      "Growing up without a mother and having survived teenage pregnancy, Bomboma said Obama's example has also instilled confidence in her and the girls she serves. Her nonprofit provides psychological services, vocational training, entrepreneurship skills development and sexual health lessons to hundreds of girls at risk of child marriage, teenage pregnancy and school dropout.",

      "The Girls Opportunity Alliance fund is intentionally designed to provide a range of support. Drake said anyone can apply for up to $50,000. The grant does not support general operations but instead goes toward a specific project outlined by the recipient.",

      "Last month, lawyers for Mangione asked that his federal charges be dismissed and the death penalty be taken off the table as a result of public comments by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d It\u2019s the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it's not used in New York state.",
      "The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime \u2014 stalking \u2014 is not a crime of violence.",
      "The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.",
      "After the killing, investigators found the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",

      "The explosion Friday morning at Accurate Energetic Systems, which supplies and researches explosives for the military, scattered debris over at least a half-mile (800-meter) area and was felt by residents more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) away, said Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis.",

      "A family cleaning their backyard in New Orleans discovered an unusual marble tablet with some characters in Latin",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A New Orleans family cleaning up their overgrown backyard made an extremely unusual find: Under the weeds was a mysterious marble tablet with Latin characters that included the phrase \u201cspirits of the dead.\"",
      "\u201cThe fact that it was in Latin that really just gave us pause, right?\u201d said Daniella Santoro, a Tulane University anthropologist. \u201cI mean, you see something like that and you say, \u2018Okay, this is not an ordinary thing.\u2019\u201d",
      "Intrigued and slightly alarmed, Santoro reached out to her classical archaeologist colleague Susann Lusnia, who quickly realized that the slab was the 1,900-year-old grave marker of a Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the image that Daniella sent me, it really did send a shiver up my spine because I was just floored,\u201d Lusnia said.",
      "Further sleuthing by Lusnia revealed the tablet had been missing from an Italian museum for decades.",
      "Sextus Congenius Verus had died at age 42, of unknown causes, after serving for more than two decades in the imperial navy on a ship named for the Roman god of medicine, Asclepius. The gravestone calls the sailor \u201cwell deserving\" and was commissioned by two people described as his \u201cheirs,\" who were likely shipmates since Roman military could not be married at the time, Lusnia said.",
      "The tablet had been in an ancient cemetery of around 20 graves of military personnel, found in the 1860s in Civitavecchia, a seaside in northwest Italy about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Rome. Its text had been recorded in 1910 and included in a catalog of Latin inscriptions, which noted the tablet\u2019s whereabouts were unknown.",
      "The tablet was later documented at the National Archeological Museum in Civitavecchia prior to World War II. But the museum had been \u201cpretty much destroyed\u201d during Allied bombing and took several decades to rebuild, Lusnia said. Museum staff confirmed to Lusnia the tablet had been missing for decades. Its recorded measurements \u2014 1 square foot (0.09 square meters) and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick \u2014 matched the size of the tablet found in Santoro\u2019s backyard.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have better DNA than that,\u201d Lusnia said.",
      "She said the FBI is in talks with Italian authorities to repatriate the tablet. An FBI spokesperson said the agency could not respond to requests for comment during the government shutdown.",

      "Perhaps no one would be more thrilled by the tablet\u2019s rediscovery than Sextus himself. Grave markers were important in Roman culture to uphold legacies, even of everyday citizens, Lusnia said.",
      "\u201cNow Sextus Congenius Verus is being talked about so much,\u201d Lusnia said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an afterlife and he\u2019s in it and he knows, he\u2019s very happy because this is what a Roman wants \u2014 to be remembered forever.\u201d",

      "One juror said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \"I would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",
      "Weinstein, 73, was acquitted on a second criminal sex act charge involving a different woman, Polish psychotherapist and former model Kaja Sokola. The judge declared a mistrial on the final charge, alleging Weinstein raped former actor Jessica Mann, after the jury foreperson declined to deliberate further.",
      "It was the second time the Oscar-winning producer was tried on some of the charges. His 2020 conviction, a watershed moment for the # MeToo movement, was overturned last year. Now his defense team, led by attorney Arthur Aidala, is fighting to eliminate his retrial conviction and head off another retrial on the undecided count.",
      "Judge Curtis Farber gave Manhattan prosecutors until Nov. 10 to conduct its own investigation and file a written response before he rules on Dec. 22. That means a decision and a possible retrial or sentencing won\u2019t come until after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is up for reelection on Nov. 4.",
      "In the affidavits, which blacked out juror names and identifying numbers, the two jurors said they feared for their safety and the foreperson\u2019s safety. They said that when the foreperson asked for civility, another juror got in his face, pointed a finger and told him: \u201cYou don't know me. I'll catch you outside.\u201d",
      "One of the jurors said deliberations were poisoned by a belief among some jurors that a member of the panel had been paid off by Weinstein or his lawyers. That claim, which has not been supported by any evidence, shifted the jury of seven women and five men \u201cfrom an even 6-6 spit to a sudden unanimous verdict,\" the juror said.",
      "Some of what was said in the affidavits echoed acrimony that spilled into public view during deliberations. As jurors weighed charges for five days, one juror asked to be excused because he felt another was being treated unfairly.",

      "After the jury returned a verdict on two of the three charges, Farber asked the foreperson whether he was willing to deliberate further. The man said no, triggering a mistrial on the rape count.",
      "After the trial, two jurors disputed the foreperson\u2019s account. One said no one mistreated him. The other said deliberations were contentious, but respectful.",
      "When jurors came forward with concerns, Farber was strict about respecting the sanctity of deliberations and cautioned them not to discuss the content or tenor of jury room discussions, transcripts show. In their affidavits, the two jurors said they didn\u2019t feel the judge was willing to listen to their concerns.",
      "When jurors were asked if they agreed with the guilty verdict, one of the jurors noted in her affidavit that she paused \u201cto try and indicate my discomfort in the verdict.\u201d Afterward, when Farber spoke with jurors, she said she told him \u201cthe deliberations were unprofessional.\u201d",
      "Weinstein denies all the charges. The first-degree criminal sex act conviction carries the potential for up to 25 years in prison, while the unresolved third-degree rape charge is punishable by up to four years \u2014 less than he already has served.",
      "He has been behind bars since his initial conviction in 2020, and he later also was sentenced to prison in a separate California case, which he is appealing.",

    "summary": "After 14 years playing NYPD detective Danny Reagan on \"Blue Bloods,\" Donnie Wahlberg now stars in the spinoff series \"Boston Blue,\" patrolling the streets of his own hometown.",
    "story": [
      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "Asbury Park is a Jersey beach town with heart, history and harmony, not to mention a voice. Bruce Springsteen's presence can still be felt in his old haunts \u2013 the Stone Pony, the Wonder Bar, Madam Marie's. The town's welcome mat is its storied boardwalk, where we met Jeremy Allen White. \"There's a lot of romance here still, I feel like,\" said White, who was thinking about his own hometown.",
      "\"Do you feel that way a little bit about Brooklyn?\" I asked.",
      "\"I do, yeah. I always feel at home there.\"",
      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\"",

      "It's a nightmare we've been living with all our lives. \"I grew up in an era when we had to hide under our desks in the case of an atomic bomb,\" said director Kathryn Bigelow, \"so I suppose I was sort of imprinted early on with the prospect of nuclear war.\"",
      "In Bigelow's new film, \"A House of Dynamite,\" the prospect of nuclear war suddenly becomes an insane reality. It tells of a single missile launched from an unknown location in the Pacific. At first it looks like a test, but it keeps on coming \u2013 with a trajectory estimated to be the continental United States.",
      "With 19 minutes to impact, the president (played by Idris Elba) has to make an impossible decision.",
      "Noah Oppenheim, a former president of NBC News, wrote the script, which dramatizes what he calls \"the insanity that we would expect a single human being with limited preparation to decide in a matter of minutes the fate of all mankind.\"",
      "Bigelow, whose previous movies include \"The Hurt Locker\" (an all-too-real look at the war in Iraq) and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden) applied her trademark authenticity to the unthinkable. \"It's my responsibility as a filmmaker, if I'm presenting an environment that really exists, to be as authentic as possible,\" she said.",
      "Bigelow says she did not seek cooperation from the Pentagon for the film: \"I felt that we needed to be more independent. But that being said, we had multiple tech advisors who have worked in the Pentagon. They were with me every day we shot.\"",
      "One military consultant was retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler. \"Never in a million years would I have thought that I would have been in this position,\" he said.",
      "Karbler nailed his audition when he opened his first Zoom call with Bigelow like this: \"'This is the DDO from the Pentagon convening a strategic conference. This conference is Top Secret. Please bring the President into the conference.' And I stopped there and clicked on my camera and I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, that's how the worst day of America's history will begin.'\"",
      "I noted, \"That doesn't sound like something you were ad-libbing?\"",
      "\"I was not ad-libbing at all,\" said Karbler. \"That comes from a lot of practice.\"",
      "He was on a movie set, but Karbler took command of the actors just as he once did with the real soldiers at Fort Greeley, Alaska, the front line of defense against an incoming missile. He described those scenes as \"super-realistic.\"",
      "He said. \"I have a son and daughter, and they're both missile defenders. And all I can think about is my own kids and how those actors totally nailed it.\"",
      "In \"A House of Dynamite,\" the missile is tracked as it arcs toward the United States. [In such a scenario, the U.S. would have less than 10 minutes to make the decisions and get interceptors airborne.]",
      "Two interceptors are launched \u2013 the classic \"bullet hitting a bullet.\"",
      "\"That kill vehicle will go and basically run itself into the incoming missile,\" said Karbler. \"That closing velocity can be in excess of 30,000 miles an hour. I think the movie has it pretty accurate when they talk about 61% chance of killing it.\"",
      "The watch officer in the White House Situation Room is played by Rebecca Ferguson. Larry Pfeiffer, who once ran the real White House Situation Room, said, \"This movie is going to give the American moviegoer a chance to feel what it's really like to work in a space like that.",
      "\"There are going to be things that happen in the world that require the immediate attention and action by the President of the United States, and you need to be as perfect as possible,\" he said.",
      "The president is in a motorcade when he's hit with the one crisis he thought he would never face: a missile inbound for Chicago. \"I had one briefing when I was sworn in,\" he says. \"One! And they told me that's the protocol!\"",
      "According to Dan Karbler, a real-world president is likely to be just as unprepared.",
      "Asked whether he had ever done a drill when the real president was involved, he replied, \"No, no, sir.\"",
      "\"So, if it were the real thing, he wouldn't have a lot of practice?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe the last president to have participated in one of the exercises was President Reagan,\" Karbler said.",
      "So, what does screenwriter Noah Oppenheim want audiences to be thinking, once they've caught their breath? \"I want people to be reminded that, even though the Cold War is long over, the nuclear era is not, and that we live, as the title says, in a house full of dynamite,\" he said.",
      "To which director Kathryn Bigelow added, \"My question is how do we take the dynamite out of the walls \u2026 without tearing down the house?\"",

      "People Magazine, which first reported Keaton's death, said the actress died in California on Saturday, Oct. 11, citing a family spokesperson.",
      "An actress for more than four decades, the beloved star thought she would be a singer, telling\u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning\" in February 2010, \"I wanted to sing. I did everything I could to be a singer.\"",
      "Born in 1946 in Los Angeles, Keaton appeared on the stage in the musical \"Hair\" at 22 years old and then in Woody Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination.",
      "Keaton said her voice wasn't good enough, and she moved on to acting, making her first film appearance in \"Lovers and Other Strangers\" in 1970, while her many early TV credits include appearances on \"Mannix,\" \"The F.B.I.,\" \"Night Gallery,\" and \"Love, American Style.\"",
      "She starred as Al Pacino's girlfriend Kay in \"The Godfather\" in 1972 and repeated the role in the crime saga's two sequels. The couple became romantically involved after the filming of The Godfather Part II, Keaton said.",

    "summary": "The owners and operators of independent cinemas are working to adapt as audience habits change.",
    "story": [
      "Audiences have been enjoying films at movie theaters for decades, but streaming and expensive\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0have impacted\u00a0moviegoing habits. For the owners and operators of independent theaters, survival means getting creative.",
      "Kevin Smith, the man behind cult classics like \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats,\" bought a theater in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2022. It was the cinema he'd gone to growing up. He renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas, and hoped that even as it reeled from COVID-19 shutdowns, he could rekindle the magic he'd loved as a child.",
      "\"I learned more about myself sitting in this (theater) than I ever did sitting in a classroom or sitting in church or something like that, and it led me to the rest of my life,\" Smith said.",
      "But the reality of operating the movie theater was difficult, even for a celebrity like Smith. They operate as a non-profit, Smith said, because if they functioned as a for-profit business, they \"would die.\" Smith can bring in celebrity guests for Q&A sessions and other events. The theater also hosts an annual film festival.",
      "\"Saving my childhood theater with my friends? Dream come true, worst financial investment I ever made in my life,\" Smith said.",
      "On the opposite coast, film store Vidiots has been bringing new movies to audiences for 40 years. When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

      "Judge Jeannette A. Vargas on Thursday  rejected the suit in a written opinion that began by citing \"the vitriolic war of words\" and saying the case arose \"from perhaps the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history.\"",
      "Filed in January, the lawsuit alleged that UMG published and promoted \"Not Like Us\" even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",

      "Lamar and Drake have been beefing for years, with the two rappers releasing several diss tracks about one another. The feud appeared to reach its height when Lamar called out Drake during his Super Bowl Halftime Show in February.",
      "In \"Not Like Us,\" which was released in May 2024, Lamar makes disturbing accusations about Drake allegedly having inappropriate conduct with minors. He also makes similar allegations about Drake's friends and continues to question Drake's talent.",

      "Lopez said she was \"immediately floored\" when she read the script for the film by writer and director Bill Condon, known for his work on \"Chicago\" and \"Dreamgirls.\" The movie is based on a 1970s novel by Manuel Puig, which Lopez described as being far ahead of its time.",

In that scene, Ingrid helps another character escape the harsh reality of prison through a fantasy-like performance.

      "\"Music and art transcends language. It doesn't matter,\" she said. \"And he's done that probably more than anybody of any generation he really has.\"",
      "Lopez said the Super Bowl gives artists a rare opportunity to reach new audiences and show who they are.",
      "\"It's about not having so many ideas and closing yourself off to experiences that you might be missing out on something wonderful. Don't do that to yourself. That's what I would say,\" she said.",

      "\"It couldn't have been a more perfect moment. And I didn't even see it. I know it was perfect-- God didn't let me see it, because I would've exploded. I would've died,\" Lopez said.",
      "For Lopez, it's always important to keep her mind and heart open, telling King she still considers herself a \"hopeful romantic\" - the term she told King she preferred over \"hopeless romantic\" in an interview in 2022.",
      "\"100%. 100%. And the more self aware I become with the lessons that I learn and the hardships that I go through, the more I feel whole and complete on my own, the more I become hopeful for that same type of person to come into my life,\" said Lopez. \"The more I know the more, you know, that type of person will come into my life.

      "Osbourne died less than three weeks later at 76 years old. Prior to his death, he gave Yungblud a cross necklace.",
      "\"He says to me, 'I hope this brings you luck. Don't compromise. They'll get it later,'\" Yungblud said, relaying Osbourne's message to him. \"I still feel him everywhere, man. It's crazy. He gave me a gift. He gave me a platform.\""

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 20:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DealBook founder and Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin takes a look at the crash of 1929 in his new book. He tells 60 Minutes what may it may indicate about today's stock market.",
    "story": [
      "After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.",
      "Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.",
      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
      "Lecornu's reappointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism \u2014 including from within his own ranks \u2014 and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.",
      "Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of \"duty.\" He said he was given a mission \"to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots.\"",
      "All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will \"incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills.\"",
      "\"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Lecornu abruptly resigned on Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.",
      "Political party leaders met for more than two hours on Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.",
      "\"How can one expect that all this will end well?\" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. \"The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes.\"",
      "Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly \u2014 the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party \u2014 weren't invited to the discussions on Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections, and France Unbowed wants him to resign.",
      "Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. \"There's a majority that can govern,\" he said. \"I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\"",
      "Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.",
      "The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries."

      "\"Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks,\" Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering \"a massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.",
      "\"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "\"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.",
      "Primed for a slide?",
      "The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.",
      "Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.",
      "Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index,\u00a0released\u00a0Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.",
      "The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

      "China produces as much as 95% of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie. Access to such materials has been a key sticking point in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.",
      "The new export controls outlined by the country's Ministry of Commerce, which took effect on Thursday, require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths sourced from China, including if those products were manufactured abroad by non-Chinese companies.",
      "An English translation of the new rules released Thursday does not specify potential penalties if exporters fail to comply with the controls.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed surprise at the the new trade measures, describing the move by China's government as \"very hostile\" and vowing to retaliate if Beijing follows through in applying the rare-earth controls.",
      "\"One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said in his post. \"There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "In June, the U.S. and China announced they had agreed on a\u00a0framework deal aimed at defusing tensions over tariffs, rare earths and other issues.",
      "Stocks fell Friday amid concerns of a renewed trade conflict between the U.S. and China, with the S&P 500 slipping 131 points, or nearly 2%, to 6,664. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 624 points, or 1.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 600 points, or 2.6%.",
      "\"After a relatively calm few months and improving relations between the U.S. and China, this step-up in tensions has created a white-knuckle moment for the markets, with tech stocks under major pressure today,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investstors.",
      "Financial markets, which pushed deeper into record territory earlier this week, have also edged down in recent days as some investors warn of a potential pubble in stocks propelled by the growth in artificial intelligence."

    "story": [
      "China has hit U.S.-owned vessels docking in the country with tit-for-tat port fees, in response to the American government's planned port fees on Chinese ships, expanding a string of retaliatory measures before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.",
      "The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the Alphaliner report was from last month, not this month."

While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"The net percentage of households expecting the unemployment rate to rise over the next year dipped to 48% in October, down from the recent high of 53% in September, but still a far bleaker picture than at the start of the year and historically consistent with a sharp rise in joblessness in the months ahead,\" Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a report.",
      "Americans remain concerned about high prices, with expectations for inflation over the next year still hovering at elevated levels. Weakening job prospects also remain top of mind for Americans, Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at U. of Michigan,\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement.",

The percentage of people saying the economy is getting worse ticked up to 59% in October compared to 54% in July, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Despite such concerns, other signals show the economy holding up. A Bank of America\u00a0report released Friday shows credit and debit card spending per household rose 2% in September from a year ago, up from 1.7% in August.",

      "The lawsuit details a number of examples of what plaintiffs alleged were \"fake sales\" during the four-day Prime Day event, which ran July 8-11.",
      "One such example is a pair of headphones advertised by Amazon on Prime Day as being on sale for 44% off the product's list price of $179.95, according to the complaint. Plaintiffs claim that the item's list price has always been in the range of \"$130 to $160\" and that the advertised 44% discount was misleading.",
      "\"Amazon uses these fake Prime Day Percentage Discounts, offered under the extreme time pressure of the brief Prime Day window, to lure consumers to purchase products,\" the complaint states.",
      "In another example, the lawsuit mentions an 8-inch Android tablet for kids listed as \"40% off,\" based on a strikethrough list price of $119.99. However, in the 90 days leading up to the sale, the tablet was being offered for between $50 and $85, with a median price of $72, according to the suit.",
      "That means the supposedly time-limited Prime Day Deal of $72.18 was actually higher than the tablet's $50 price Amazon was selling the item for in April, and about the same price the item usually goes for on Amazon, the lawsuit alleges.",

      "Travelers planning to fly into or out of U.S. airports could feel the impact of staffing issues, which continue to build as the government shutdown\u00a0reached its 10th day Friday.",
      "The \"national picture today looks a little messy,\" CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.",
      "Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the\u00a0Columbus Day\u00a0weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are\u00a0deemed essential\u00a0by the government, requiring them\u00a0to keep working\u00a0during the shutdown without immediate pay.",
      "However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as\u00a0potential weather disruptions\u00a0are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.",
      "\"On top top that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business.",
      "\"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically,\" Van Cleave said.",

    "summary": "The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments to the federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The IRS is adjusting the income limits for its federal income tax brackets to account for the impact of inflation, an annual reset that could provide relief for some Americans when they file their taxes next year.",
      "The IRS makes these adjustments, typically in October or November, to avoid what it known as \"bracket creep,\" which is when inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, potentially forcing them to dole out more money come April.",
      "The upshot: Americans will have to earn more income next year before reaching a higher tax bracket. For example, the upper tax limit on a single filer making $50,000 will be 12% in 2026 versus 22% in 2025.",
      "See the updated tax brackets below.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment on the inflation rate it applied in adjusting its tax brackets for 2026. Bloomberg Tax forecasted last month that the agency would apply an inflation rate of 2.7%.",
      "In 2024, the IRS adjusted\u00a0its tax bracket thresholds by 5.4%\u00a0to account for the lingering inflation that erupted during the pandemic. That followed a\u00a0historically large adjustment\u00a0of 7% in 2023.",
      "The IRS uses the\u00a0\"Chained Consumer Price Index\"\u00a0data from the past 12 months to make adjustments for the 2026 tax year, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
      "The IRS announced Wednesday that an agency-wide furlough would begin on Oct. 8 due to a lapse in federal appropriations as a result of the government shutdown. Taxpayers with an Oct. 15 extension deadline should plan on submitting their returns as planned, according to the agency.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,\" a spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Standard Deduction",
      "In addition to setting the federal income tax brackets, the IRS also released changes to 2026 standard deductions on Thursday.",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",

      "Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Seniors could see additional relief due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for people aged 65 and older. The tax break, which is set to expire at the end of 2028, is available to those with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly.",
      "Earned Income Tax Credit",
      "The maximum amount for households that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit will be $8,231 for families with at least three children, up from $8,046 for the current tax year, the IRS said.",
      "Estate tax limit",
      "The estates of wealthy Americans will see a bigger tax break in 2026 than they did this year. The IRS said Thursday that the estates of people who die in 2026 will have a basic exclusion amount of $15 million, up from nearly $14 million in the 2025 tax year.",
      "Health Flexible Spending",
      "U.S. workers can now voluntarily contribute up to $3,400 to their health flexible spending accounts, up $100 from prior year. These contributions, which are deducted pre-tax from employee paychecks, go toward an account that can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is. Take the example of a married couple with $150,000 in gross income. They would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%.",
      "However, their effective tax rate \u2014 meaning the percentage of their annual income that they will pay to the IRS \u2014\u00a0is much lower, as follows:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxes",
      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",
      "How the OBBBA will impact taxes",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, made most of the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, helping some American taxpayers avert a scheduled tax increase.",
      "As a result of the Republican spending bill, the typical filer could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, with benefits varying depending on the filer's geographic location, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0in August from the Tax Foundation.",
      "A taxpayer's income will also influence the tax cuts they see, with higher-income Americans more likely to see a bigger benefit from tax provisions in the legislation than lower-income households.",
      "A July\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center found that the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments in 2026, or 0.8% of their income. By comparison, those in the top quintile \u2014 those who earn $217,101 or more \u2014 will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their income."

    "story": [
      "Senators have launched an inquiry into companies paid billions in taxpayer dollars to build eligibility systems for Medicaid, expressing concern that error-riddled technology and looming work requirements \"will cause Americans to lose Medicaid coverage to this bureaucratic maze.\"",
      "The letters, dated Oct. 10, were sent to four companies and follow a KFF Health News investigation that exposed widespread issues in states using Deloitte-run systems to assess Medicaid eligibility for millions of people. Failures have resulted in the erroneous loss of health coverage and other vital safety-net benefits for low-income people. Malfunctions in those systems can cost millions and take years to fix.",
      "As most states prepare to institute work requirements mandated by the tax and domestic spending law President Trump signed in July, senators wrote it is each company's responsibility to build functioning systems, \"rather than to prioritize their bottom line.\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent the letters to several companies the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified as eligibility system contractors: Deloitte, GDIT, Gainwell Technologies, and Conduent.",
      "\"They're essentially health care middlemen that are in the business of red tape, and they profit when Americans don't get health care,\" Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicaid, said in an interview.",
      "\"They've got a history of poor performance when it comes to determining eligibility or in helping Americans enroll in Medicaid,\" Wyden said. \"Without stronger oversight and real accountability, these contractors are just going to get a jumbo windfall for creating systems that actually harm Americans trying to get health care.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the four companies did not provide comments for this article.",
      "As of June, 70.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid, according to CMS.",
      "A handful of states operate their own Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems, but most rely on contractors to build and run them. KFF Health News found that Deloitte, a global consultancy that generated $70.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, dominates this slice of government business. Twenty-five states have awarded Deloitte contracts for eligibility systems. The agreements, in which the company commits to design, develop, implement, or operate state-owned systems, are worth at least $6 billion, dwarfing any of its competitors.",
      "Kinda Serafi, a partner at Manatt Health, is advising states on how to reconfigure their systems to incorporate work requirements.",
      "States are in a \"major sprint\" to make changes by 2027, she said, and they're being \"inundated\" with pitches from vendors looking to secure contracts. It underscores the business opportunity these system changes represent for contractors.",
      "\"I think we have to really be vigilant to make sure that these vendors are implementing the requirements consistent with the law,\" Serafi said.",
      "Companies sign contracts with state governments, but the federal government pays the bulk of the cost. The federal government covers 90% of states' costs to develop and implement state Medicaid eligibility systems and 75% of ongoing maintenance and operations expenses, according to federal regulations.",
      "The Senate letters cite problems with Deloitte-run eligibility systems that KFF Health News identified. Among other issues, the Florida eligibility system erroneously cut benefits for new moms, and a problem in Kentucky prevented coverage applications from getting through online, which cost $522,455 and took 10 months to resolve.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of third-party systems' failure to serve their very function: to reliably and accurately determine an individual's eligibility for Medicaid coverage and services,\" the senators wrote.",
      "The senators asked the companies to respond by Oct. 31 to their questions, such as whether companies' contracts with states include financial incentives tying payment to the removal of Medicaid enrollees and whether the companies are penalized for coverage terminations made in error. The senators also demanded an accounting of the company's lobbying expenditures for the past five years and protocols for making system changes.",
      "By 2027, the Congressional Budget Office projected, based on an early version of the bill, 18.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to work or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month to keep their benefits, unless they qualify for an exemption. The CBO estimates that 5.3 million enrollees will lose coverage by 2034.",
      "The new work requirements are just one of several federally mandated Medicaid changes that are forcing states to adapt their eligibility systems.",
      "Medicaid work requirements have been plagued with problems in the few states where they've been tested. Medicaid enrollees have been frustrated in trying to navigate byzantine rules and glitchy technology. Work requirements have also come at great cost.",

Instead, the state offers benefits to some people earning up to the poverty line who can prove they're working or participating in similar activities for 80 hours a month. Nearly 110,000 Georgians had applied to the state's Georgia Pathways to Coverage program through May, but only 9,157 people were enrolled as of mid-August. Under typical ACA expansion rules, 336,000 adults would be eligible for coverage, according to KFF.",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

      "Here is what three federal workers \u2014 who shared their personal views with CBS News and were not speaking on behalf of their respective agencies \u2014 describe as their biggest concerns as the shutdown continues.",
      "\"No pay has me anxious\"",
      "James Kirwan, an attorney with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the legislative affairs director for the agency's union, is currently furloughed and does not expect to be paid until lawmakers resolve the dispute and pass a government funding bill.",
      "\"No pay has me anxious because none of us have any idea how long the shutdown is going to go on for. It could be weeks, or it could be a short shutdown,\" Kirwan, who has been with the NLRB for three years, told CBS News. \"The longer it gets, the more debt people will have to incur to survive during the interim period.\"",
      "\"It's certainly scary, especially for federal workers making under $50,000 a year, and for federal contractors who have no guarantee of backpay whatsoever under the law,\" he added.",
      "Kirwan, 31, said that if the shutdown drags on for weeks or months, he would likely have to lean on credit cards to afford the basics, and perhaps take out a loan for any larger expenses.",
      "\"Like many Americans, I have very little in the way of emergency funds and savings, and I know I would not be able to hold on if it's a very long shutdown,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Kirwan, who said he had aspired to work in government since his youth, also emphasized his commitment to public service despite the political turmoil.",
      "\"While taking on that additional debt and loans is certainly painful, if it results in jobs and my agency being saved and strengthened, I'll take that deal any day,\" he said.",
      "Asked for comment regarding government workers' concerns about the impact of the shutdown on their finances, the White House blamed congressional Democrats for the stalemate.",
      "\"The Trump Administration is encouraging the Democrats to stop the pain and reopen the government with the bipartisan funding proposal they supported just six months ago and 13 times under Biden \u2014 but Chuck Schumer thinks every day of the shutdown 'gets better.' How dismissive to countless Americans struggling because of his party's decision,\"\u00a0 White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The office for Schumer, the Senate minority leader and a Democrat from New York, didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "The Republic National Committee and Democratic National Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the impact of the shutdown on federal workers.",
      "\"People aren't able to get justice\"",
      "MT Snyder, who also works for the NLRB as a field examiner and is a member of the agency's union, said the shutdown is hampering the board's efforts to investigate employee claims of unfair labor practices and other workplace disputes.",
      "\"Everything is stopped, so workers who were illegally fired don't have any recourse because there is nowhere else to go beside the NLRB,\" Snyder, whose work involves investigating such complaints, told CBS News. \"So it's really frustrating that I am not able to do my job, and people aren't able to get justice.\"",
      "Snyder, 30, also said the uncertainty around when she can return to work amounts to a \"huge psychological toll\" that weighs on her and other government employees.",
      "\"As federal workers, we don't have any say. We are not in Congress making choices, but we get the outcome of it and feel those effects,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The NLRB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a\u00a0notice\u00a0posted on the agency's website on Sept. 30, before the shutdown began, the NLRB stated that unfair labor practice hearings scheduled for Oct. 1 or later would be postponed indefinitely.",
      "\"There is a moral injury\"",
      "Another federal employee \u2014 who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs but who didn't want to be identified by name because she fears potential retribution \u2014 is among those employees who is still on the job during the shutdown.",
      "She expects to be paid on time because her department has already allocated funds for her position, but also said the shutdown is further sapping workers' morale.",
      "\"We deserve job security, dignity and respect, and this just feels like an extension of what was already occurring,\" she said, referring to the mass government layoffs that have taken place under the Trump administration. \"It is not a good way to live, and there is a moral injury that comes with being a federal worker right now. People are stressed.\"",
      "Like Kirwan, however, she also underlined her belief in the value of government service. \"In no way am I considering leaving the federal government. I entered to retire from the federal government and I intend to do just that.\""

      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-is-the-price-of-gold-rising-4000-ounce-economy/",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices."

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\""

      "Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live.",
      "Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging\ufeff\u00a0(NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.",
      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\""

      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",

      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",

      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",

      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters."

      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told CBS News on Sunday that some of the RIF notices that went to CDC employees Friday were sent because of a coding error and have been rescinded. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News that the employees \"who received incorrect notifications were never separated from the agency and have all been notified that they are not subject to the reduction in force.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance on Sunday accused Democrats of \"hostage-taking\" with their posture in the government shutdown, as Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
      "\"We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Twelve days into the government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the impasse, without a clear resolution in sight. As Senate Republican leadership has held repeat votes on a House-passed measure to fund the government, looking to peel off support from across the aisle, Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support to reopen the government. And as Democrats call for negotiations in the funding fight, Republican leaders say there's nothing to negotiate.",
      "When asked Sunday about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the stalemate would only be solved by negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House, Vance said \"this isn't a deal-making, this isn't a negotiation, this is hostage-taking.\"",
      "\"If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans,\" Vance said. \"But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, 'unless you the President of the United States give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government.'\"",
      "Vance added, \"we'll negotiate over health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up people's government.\"",
      "On the question of the health insurance tax credits, Vance said \"we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry, so we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House,\" Vance said. \"But if the far-left Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage-taking. And we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Meanwhile on Friday, the White House announced that layoffs previewed earlier in the shutdown had begun, and the administration said in a court filing that seven agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices to more than 4,000 workers.",
      "Vance said the government is focused on \"ensuring essential services remain open\" when asked how the administration is deciding who gets laid off. And he urged that \"this is not a situation that we're excited about,\" saying \"we want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.\"",
      "Pressed about the layoffs, some of which were rescinded, Vance said \"the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\"",
      "\"We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\" Vance said. \"That chaos is because Schumer and the far-left Democrats shut down the government.\"",
      "On whether the layoffs can hold up to legal scrutiny after two unions sued to block the mass layoffs during the shutdown, Vance said, \"we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do.\"",
      "\"All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government,\" Vance said. \"If they just join with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all these conversations will no longer be necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said Vance is \"just not living in reality.\"",
      "\"There's no negotiations happening right now, because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations,\" Murphy said, arguing they are doing so \"because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\"",
      "Murphy said \"this is an emergency.\"",
      "\"We have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,\" Murphy said. \"Those are urgent matters.\""

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Badr Abdelatty, foreign minister of Egypt, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Dr. Badr Abdelatty, and he joins us this morning from Cairo. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER BADR ABDELATTY: Good to be with you, Margaret. Thank you so much for hosting me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump is headed to Egypt. I know he will be meeting with President al-Sisi tomorrow in Sharm El-Sheik to discuss this agreement about Gaza. But everything seems dependent on this hostage release and the conclusion of phase one, from what you know and hear from Hamas, will those hostages be released in the next 24 hours?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, we are confident that the first phase of the Trump peace plan will be implemented, will be honored by all parts concerns, and we are moving ahead. We are very hopeful that the first phase will be completed, in all honesty from the two parties, and we are in full contact with the Palestinians, with the Hamas, because it's all about, of course, releasing the hostages, and for Israel, releasing some of the Palestinian detainees, returning back some- I mean, the bodies of the those who passed away, but that will take time to collect the remains, of course, and to allow the flow of all humanitarian assistance to Gaza without impediments, In order to deal with current famine and starvation in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the vice president, who you just heard, said that President Trump has convinced a number of countries to provide ground troops to go into Gaza. Will Egypt be sending ground troops into Gaza?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, part of the deal is, of course, the issue of security arrangement, and we are working on different levels. First of all, there are some Palestinians in Gaza. They will be trained and be deployed in Gaza. We are in the process now, as we speak, providing training and coordination with Jordan to train up to 5000 Palestinians to be deployed in Gaza as well. Deployment of international force is on the table. We are supporting this idea, of course, and there are some countries, expressed their readiness to deploy forces to contribute with the forces on the ground. And we have to work now on going to the security council, of course, to endorse the proposal, as well as defining the main mandate of this troops on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader of Indonesia is already committed to 20,000 troops. Is Egypt going to commit troops? Do you have a number?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: We are, we are going to support and to commit troops within specific parameters. As I mentioned, we must have a mandate by the security council to endorse it, and of course, to you know, specify the mission of the of the troops on the ground, which will be peace keeping, and how to provide training to the Palestinian policeman in order to do the job, to- to have law enforcement on the ground. And, of course, to define the whole mission, and for how long, because it will be a transitional one, in order to help to the Palestinians to assume their four responsibilities, and to tell we have the realization of the Palestinian state on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are committing there to a Palestinian state. The President of the United States has given a more vague language, and when I pressed the Secretary of State on this point just last weekend, he said, This is far off in the future. How long do you think it's going to take before Palestinians are ruling Gaza and that we will see a state?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, what's very urgent now is, of course, ending this war on the innocent civilians in Gaza, provide as much as food and medicine to the people there. And then we have to move forward with regard to the early recovery and reconstructions of Gaza. And of course, talking about issues related to the governance and the security arrangement in Gaza. And of course, from our point of view, the end game, the final, comprehensive solution will be the realization of the Palestinian state. Because without that, we are confident through we have to draw lessons from the past, that without solving the Palestinian cause, which is the core of the conflict in the region, without respecting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to have their own statehood, you know, there is no peace and stability in the region. And the Trump peace plan, it refers to the statehood. And of course, 144 countries voted in favor of the two-state solution in New York recently. So this is a game on town.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, again, that's going to seemingly take a lot of time. I want to go back to the question of security, because it is essential for rebuilding, and share with you some of what the United Nations estimates here. The UN says 92% of housing units in Gaza are destroyed or damaged. Almost 92% of schools will require full reconstruction or rehab. 77% of the total road network has been damaged. 86% of total cropland is destroyed. How much is this going to cost, and where is this money coming from?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, first of all, we have full confidence on the leadership of President Trump and his vision for peace. He's the only person who is capable to end the war and to open a new chapter in the Middle East, a chapter of hope, of prosperity and peace for all peoples, including, of course, the Israeli people, the Palestinians, and all peoples in our region. So we are very appreciative, we are commanding his leadership, and we are in full support of his vision and his leadership. This is one. Number two, we are working very hard now with regard to convening an international conference in cooperation between Egypt and the United States, as well as with a lot of partners, including Germany, European Union, France, Italy, Spain, Qatar, Gulf Cooperation Council, Japan, everybody is standing ready to participate in this conference for The reconstruction and redevelopment of Gaza, it will be a merge between the Arab and Islamic plan for the reconstruction and the Trump peace plan. So I met today with the Deputy Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations, Tom Fletcher, and we are working very hard now for having a final assessment report. On the--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll look for that number to be released in the future, Mr. Foreign Minister, I have to leave it there for now. Good luck with the conference. We'll be right back."

      "Hopeful Gazans have begun the trek back to their homes, as the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas continues to hold. But the rebuilding and recovery ahead is daunting and still very much unsettled. President Trump will join special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in the region as peace talks continue.",
      "Democrats Chris Murphy and Jim Himes will be here, in addition to the vice president. And we will hear from a key player in the region on the next part of the peace process.",
      "With the shutdown now in its 12th day, more federal facilities are facing closure, paychecks are on the verge of being missed, and the Trump administration has begun sending reduction in force notices to some federal employees.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Well, these are largely people that the Democrats want. Many of them will be fired.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin today with Vice President J.D. Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati this morning.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "J.D. VANCE (Vice President of the United States): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72-hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the president is actually traveling to the Middle East likely this evening in order to meet them and greet them in person.",
      "It's a big day for their families, but I think, more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. Now, the president of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel \u2013 which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive.",
      "It was a very tall task. He pursued a very nontraditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And, of course, the president was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it.",
      "But I think that, because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done, we are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular of this deal.",
      "Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 U.S. troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here?",
      "And, more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret.",
      "It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the president of the United States on down. I know the president is very committed to doing that.",
      "But you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here.",
      "There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about. We see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace.",
      "One of the underreported elements of this deal, Margaret, is that the president convinced the entire Muslim world really, both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety.",
      "And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground.",
      "We're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and, of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security, you said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\"",
      "Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been OK with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the president didn't agree with?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, look, as the president said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser-focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid.",
      "That's a difficult balance to strike. But I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states, really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded, they were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel, this is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world.",
      "It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100 percent sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening, when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government.",
      "There were more than 4,000 layoff notices, called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements, that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the president described this.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this, so we'll give them a little taste of their own medicine.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on, Margaret, is ensuring essential services remain open.",
      "And, obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low-income women and children get the food services that they need.",
      "We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops, because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused. And, unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about.",
      "We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs. That's why it's a little different this time.",
      "And specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector, CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case.",
      "But some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, so \u2013 so two \u2013 two responses to that, Margaret.",
      "First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well.",
      "But the second point, Margaret, is, the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government.",
      "We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and \u2013 and, to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the president talking about that. That \u2013 that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does.",
      "And, in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential \u2013 essential services stay on.",
      "But, unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the \u2013 the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us.",
      "That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Antideficiency Act?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, we are confident, Margaret.",
      "Of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret?",
      "All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed Leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the president of the United States.",
      "Only the five people, including the president, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the president insist that lawmakers come back to Washington, sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving the shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate and, again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a dealmaker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans, like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a dealmaking. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage-taking.",
      "Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that, unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans.",
      "Of course we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the president of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low-income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops.",
      "That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle \u2013 you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans.",
      "We want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats. We are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, just a quick follow there, though. What is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.",
      "We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that, if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And, again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually, Margaret.",
      "That's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation. That's a hostage-taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",

      "But everything seems dependent on this hostage release and the conclusion of phase one. From what you know and hear from Hamas, will those hostages be released in the next 24 hours?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, we are confident that the first phase of the Trump peace plan will be implemented, will be honored by all parts concerns.",
      "And we are moving ahead. We are very hopeful that the first phase will be completed in all honesty from the two parties. And we are in full contact with the Palestinians, with the Hamas, because it's all about, of course, releasing the hostages and, for Israel, releasing some of the Palestinian detainees, returning back some \u2013 I mean, the bodies of the \u2013 those who passed away.",
      "But that will take time to collect the remains, of course, and to allow the flow of all humanitarian assistance to Gaza without impediments in order to deal with current famine and starvation in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vice president, who you just heard, said that President Trump has convinced a number of countries to provide ground troops to go into Gaza. Will Egypt be sending ground troops into Gaza?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, part of the deal is, of course, the issue of security arrangement. And we are working on different levels.",
      "First of all, there are some Palestinians in Gaza. They will be trained and be deployed in Gaza. We are in the process now, as we speak, providing training and coordination with Jordan to train up to 5,000 Palestinians to be deployed in Gaza as well.",
      "Deployment of international force is on the table. We are supporting this idea, of course. And there are some countries expressed their readiness to deploy forces to contribute with the forces on the ground. And we have to work now on going to the Security Council, of course, to endorse the proposal, as well as defining\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader of Indonesia is already committed to 20,000 troops. Is Egypt going to commit troops? Do you have a number?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: We are. We are going to support and to commit troops within specific parameters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: As I mentioned, we must have a mandate by the Security Council to endorse it and, of course, to specify the mission of the troops on the ground, which will be peacekeeping, and how to provide training to the Palestinian policemen in order to do their job, to have law enforcement on the ground, and, of course, to define the whole mission\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 and for how long, because it will be a transitional one, in order to help the Palestinians to assume their full responsibilities and to \u2013 until we have the realization of the Palestinian state on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are committing there to a Palestinian state. The president of the United States has given a bit more vague language.",
      "And when I pressed the secretary of state on this point just last weekend, he said this is far off in the future. How long do you think it's going to take before Palestinians are ruling Gaza and that we will see a state?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, what's very urgent now is, of course, ending this war on the innocent civilians in Gaza, provide as much as \u2013 food and medicine to the people there.",
      "And then we have to move forward with regard to the early recovery and the reconstructions of Gaza, and, of course, talking about issues related to the governance and the security arrangement in Gaza.",
      "And, of course, from our point of view, the endgame, the final comprehensive solution will be the realization of the Palestinian state, because, without that, we are confident through \u2013 we have to draw lessons from the past that, without solving the Palestinian cause, which is the core of the conflict in the region, without respecting the legitimate aspirations\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 of the Palestinians to have their own statehood, there is no peace and stability in the region.",
      "And the Trump peace plan, it refers to the statehood. And, of course, 144 countries voted in favor of\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it \u2013 again, that's going to seemingly take a lot of time.",
      "I want to go back to the question of security, because it is essential for rebuilding, and share with you some of what the United Nations estimates here. The U.N. says 92 percent of housing units in Gaza are destroyed or damaged. Almost 92 percent of schools will require full reconstruction or rehab; 77 percent of the total road network has been damaged; 86 percent of total cropland is destroyed.",
      "How much is this going to cost, and where is this money coming from?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, first of all, we have full confidence on the leadership of President Trump and his vision for peace.",
      "He's the only person who is capable to end the war and to open a new chapter in the Middle East, a chapter of hope, of prosperity and peace for all peoples, including, of course, the Israeli people, the Palestinians and all peoples in our region. So we are very appreciative, who are commending his leadership, and we are in full support of his vision and his leadership.",

I think that politically the Israel lost their name (ph) in the war because we went maybe too far in Gaza. I think the attack in Doha (ph) was also, you know, one step too much. But, in the end, it brought at least the President Trump to made the right decision to stop the war.",

Forty=eight hostages, living and dead, will be exchanged for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 detained since October, 2023. The deadline is Monday.

      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, it's really important that we have a ceasefire. It's important that these hostages are coming home. And I congratulate the negotiators on getting this done. There's \u2013 there's no politics about this moment, as you're going to see some very tearful reunions tomorrow, hopefully, as these hostages are released.",
      "But you watch those devastating images of what Gaza looks like today, and it's both heartbreaking and infuriating that this deal has been on the table for over a year, and it's been Benjamin Netanyahu, because of his political considerations, domestically, trying to protect himself, has frustrated the ability to find peace and to get the hostages home far before today.",
      "So, again, this will be a good week. But as you have reported, there are big issues to come. Israel is not fully pulling out of Gaza. There's no clear path forward on what the security and governance force is going to look like inside that country. There's certainly a risk of hostilities begin again if we don't build on this first phase and come to some decisions about what Gaza looks like heading into next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden wasn't willing to put this kind of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump has. Your point is, that's got to be sustained pressure to see this all the way through. Am I understanding you?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: I mean, listen, I think the barrier here has been Netanyahu. And Netanyahu is only going to move if he thinks that his relationship with the United States is at risk. And so clearly, the pressure is going to have to continue to be strong and constant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, let me ask you about the other diplomacy that needs to happen just up the street, frankly. You have called on Democrats to stiffen their spines, to stand up to the president of the United States. At what point, though, does this pain become too much in terms of the cost of the shutdown, and when are Democrats going to show some flexibility on this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, I listened to the vice president, and he's just not living in reality. The fact \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, because there's no negotiations happening right now because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations. They are boycotting negotiations to reopen the government because they are desperate to raise premiums on people on this country by 75 percent in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy. Their only priority is protecting the billionaire class and the corporate class.",
      "The other reason the House of Representatives isn't in town right now trying to reopen the government, because they are about to have enough votes to pass a resolution mandating the release of the Epstein files.",
      "So, J.D. Vance and Donald Trump's number one priority is protecting billionaires, protecting corporations, and raising premiums, raising healthcare costs by 75 percent on American citizens.",
      "So, yes, I think that Democrats should say, if you want our votes for a budget, it can't be a corrupt budget. It can't be a budget that is going to devastate the lives of middle class families in this country in order to protect and reward billionaires. That's a pretty reasonable request.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the premiums that will increase an average of about $1,000, I believe, for those who are using some of these health care programs through the government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, that's the average. But in Connecticut, some families will see a $25,000 increase in premiums. And again, in order to afford a $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because also it wasn't dealt with earlier when Democrats were in leadership here.",
      "But you \u2013 but you did hear the vice president say, when it came to healthcare, \"the administration is open to a discussion. We want to lower insurance premiums.\" That was a quote there. Did you hear any chance of an opening?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: I mean, there are no negotiations happening, in large part because the House of Representatives isn't even here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: They've been on an unprecedented five-week recess because they do not want to risk their billionaire tax cut. And they also don't want to talk about the president's lawlessness. I mean, that's the other thing that we have to talk about in this budget. If we're going to fund this administration, we need to fund an administration that is paying attention to a law.",
      "I would be a sucker, Margaret, to vote for a budget that allows the president to then go and spend money only in states that are run by Republicans and spend no money in states that are run by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is just the seven-week deal that we're talking about at this point. The \u2013 the short-term funding.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have been critical in the past of the tactic of choosing to shut down the government. You were in 2018. You were back in 2013, when it was a discussion over healthcare. This is what you said in 2018.",

      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't you doing today exactly what you were criticizing then?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No. That was a fight over sort of the long-term structure of the American healthcare system. This is an emergency. In about a month, premiums are going to go up by people by 75 percent. And we have to make a decision of whether this budget is going to allow for that happen \u2013 to happen or to stop it.",
      "What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency. So, we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are going to \u2013 about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country. Those are urgent matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do not \u2013 you do not trust that if you vote to open the government and then have a separate conversation about healthcare, that there will be any follow-through?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Absolutely not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that is what the vice president was arguing here, that it's like, Democrats aren't even saying what it is they want to negotiate over.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No, you \u2013 you cannot trust this administration. And I think it's important to remember that we didn't have a shutdown when Joe Biden was president. And the reason is, because they didn't play the kind of games that Republicans are playing. Joe Biden and Democrats, when we were in charge of the Senate, negotiated with Republicans and avoided shutdowns. This shutdown is happening because Republicans are desperate to protect their billionaire tax cut. And all we are asking \u2013 we're not asking to fix the entire American health care system \u2013",

And in that interview he said, \"Every day this goes on, every day gets better for us.\" The speaker of the House said that was a callous statement.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, they're \u2013 they're sort of desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been critical of Schumer in the past. Back in March, you were saying, we've got to stand up and do something. Is this about the tactic of just saying, hey, we're standing up?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No. As every day goes on there are more Republicans that are breaking with J.D. Vance and President Trump in saying, yes, we should be willing to sit down and talk about the health care crisis that is about to visit this country. There are more Republicans that are breaking with the president's regime of censorship. So, as every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are willing to stand up and protect the American people, to try to stop the president's destruction of democracy, and hopefully at some point there will be enough Republicans to join us and try to protect people's pocketbooks, which are about to be destroyed \u2013 their economic livelihoods are about to be destroyed by these enormous increase in health care costs.",

      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Where is the House of Representatives, Margaret? They're on vacation. The only way you can solve a shutdown is to have two parties that are in Washington negotiating. This is pretty simple. Republicans are boycotting negotiations. They're in the witness protection program all over the country, refusing to even show up for work. If they're serious about sitting down to reopen the government, they would be in Washington, rather than spread out all over the country.",

And, of course, you know, there are bipartisan bills in the Congress right now which would impose very severe sanctions on the Russians that would do a lot to stop the export of their oil, which, of course, is the fuel that drives their war machine, the dollars that drive their war machine. Those have not been moved forward by the White House. So, it's hard to say that President Trump is doing anything other than what he's done forever when he was president, which is trying to sort of have it \u2013 have it both ways.",
      "Now, I will say, and I can't get into particular attacks or particular authorities that the government has, but these attacks on the refineries have had the effect of reducing Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other stuff almost by 20 percent. That really, really hurts the Russians. And I will tell you, again without being specific, that I wish the president would be much more aggressive with respect to turning off those taps and with respect to arming the Ukrainians.",
      "But he hasn't taken any meaningful step back \u2013 steps back from the Biden administration. So, we've at least got that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not so much that he's doing more, it's that perhaps he's freeing up more to be done by the Ukrainian military, not putting the same restrictions on them that he had been? Is that fair to say?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, again, I don't want to get \u2013 don't want to get specific with respect to authorities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But, you know, his rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians, and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient. By the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient. But they haven't been consistent with his very skeptical rhetoric. I haven't noticed a dramatic change, pull back, if you will, from the Biden administration with respect to our assistance o the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you because Zelenskyy and Trump spoke twice in the past 48 hours, which is notable.",
      "Venezuela, there are close to \u2013 the numbers we've seen are like 6,000 or so service people in the southern command region of operations. There have been four U.S. strikes on vessels. The U.S. says 21 people killed. You have been asking for legal justification from the administration to explain their actions. And you did it along with the head of Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security. Can you, in any way, compel more information sharing so the U.S. knows what is being done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, I mean \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) public (ph), I should say.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: One of the many troubling aspects about these lethal attacks in the Caribbean against supposedly drug dealing boats, now, we don't know that because, unlike our counterterrorism programs, the Congress is not being told who are on these boats, how they were identified, what the intelligence was. Totally different thing.",
      "Congress is being told nothing on this. And that's OK, apparently, with the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. It's not OK with me.",
      "I'm going to leave a little bit of a crack in the door here because, again, the White House has not shared what they believe their legal justification is. They did put out a memo. I will tell you that based on what I know now and the reading of that memo, these are illegal killings. They are illegal killings because the notion that the United States \u2013 and this is what the administration says is their justification, is involved in an armed conflict with any drug dealers, Venezuelan drug dealers, is ludicrous. It wouldn't stand up in a single court of law. It's what \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they've designated them as terrorists, therefore they can use those (INAUDIBLE).",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There's lots of people who have been designated terrorists. That does not automatically give the authority to take lethal action.",
      "So, their legal justifications are laughable. And what \u2013 and again, unless they want to share more than what they've shared with me, these are illegal killings. And what \u2013 what amazes me about that is that the president, of course, thanks to this very compliant Supreme Court, has been given absolute immunity. But what about the secretary of defense? What about the deputy \u2013 what about everybody else in that chain of command, right on down to the guy who's pulling a trigger that results in the deaths of people without clear, legal authority, what about them?",
      "Test me on this. It wouldn't surprise me if in the next couple of years there are presidential pardons offered to that entire chain of command because it is not at all clear \u2013 well, it is getting increasingly clear that these are \u2013 that these are illegal killings.",
      "Setting aside the law for a second, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, I don't know this because they're not telling Congress anything, but the press has all sorts of rumors that the first attack was on a boat that had turned around and was fleeing. Even if this were a legitimate, military action, which it's not because the Congress hasn't approved it, you know, firing on a fleeing enemy would be a violation on our laws of armed conflict. My Republican friends are saying, but these are terrible people doing terrible things. OK, I don't disagree with you on that, but are we now in the business of killing people who are doing bad things without authority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 are you saying that these were not lawful orders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Again \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That, in fact, the military was carrying \u2013 because what we constantly hear from our military leaders is, do not worry, our United States military is going to be reliant on the Constitution and only carry out lawful orders. Are you saying that these members of the military, who were the trigger pullers, did something else?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I am saying that to all appearances, these are illegal killings. And you can get a thousand different lawyers of both parties on this show to tell you that at best the legal authorities are questionable.",
      "So, I am fascinated by why the chain of command is so confident that the lethal activities they're taking are legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: They don't look that way to me. And this is a big deal, right? I mean, I understand that right now we're in a very polarizing environment, so it's going to be very hard for a Republican colleague of mine to make the statements that I have just made.",
      "But the worm (ph) turns, Margaret. You know, in 1968, we prosecuted \u2013 convicted of murder a lieutenant. Lieutenant Cali (ph), because he and his unit killed probably hundreds of people in Meli (ph), in Vietnam, and there were prosecutions after that. So, I'm a little fascinated about why that chain of command is so comfortable undertaking killings just because the Trump administration says, oh, it's OK. Not an administration that is known for their adherence to the law or to the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, that is a huge topic, and I want to continue covering that with you. But I need to ask you as well about the shutdown and the cost in your home state.",
      "We saw from just USAA, which is a lender and a bank to many people who work for the federal government, they said that they've had to provide $150 million in no interest loans to 4,500 people in just over 48 hours. That's a cash crunch for a lot of people.",
      "What's happening in Connecticut?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, I mean, I'll tell you a Connecticut story. The day after the shutdown went into effect, I went up to see the National Guard at Windsor Locks Airport. We were deploying 500 Connecticut National Guard members to the Middle East. These were 22, 23-year-olds. None of them are wealthy. None of them are going to get paid on October 15th. And I heard the vice president on your show say that this is about the Democrats. The American people understand that the Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, and they control the House. So, when the vice president of the United States is saying, this is all about Chuck Schumer, who the American people rejected in the last election, I think the American people see through that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House seems to be trying to take that issue off the table. The president posted on social media that they're going to repurpose funds somehow to pay the military, at least for this pay cycle. Is that sustainable? Is that legal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, probably not. Again, we just had a little conversation about the White House's understanding of United States law, which is \u2013 which is \u2013 which is pretty tentative to say the best.",
      "The speaker of the House, because I think to pay the military during a shut down, would require legislation. The speaker of the House has taken that off the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As it has in the past.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, I mean, is Donald Trump going to say a bunch of stuff? Yes, he's going to say a bunch of stuff. But I don't see anything moving. The House, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the House is, you know, on vacation. So, no, I don't see \u2013 think that that's very likely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the speaker says if the government wasn't shut down, the military would be getting a pay if Democrats voted for the short term funding bill. But no one's working right now, as you just said.",
      "We'll have to continue to track this.",
      "Thank you, Congressman Himes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Good to have you here. You are a House lawmaker in town, but I want to talk to you about your intelligence portfolio. The Financial Times is reporting, right now, that the United States is helping Ukraine to target Russian oil installations. In other words, hitting Russia right in that pocketbook. What can you say in regard to how the Trump administration is changing its policy? Are they truly now standing up to Vladimir Putin?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now, here in studio, by Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Thank you for being with us.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just on this topic, I know you have a lot of differences with the President, but on this, is this a clear win?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, it's really important that we have a cease fire. It's important that these hostages are coming home, and I congratulate the negotiators on getting this done. There's, there's no politics about this moment, as you're going to see some very tearful reunions tomorrow, hopefully as these hostages are released. But you watch those devastating images of what Gaza looks like today, and it's both heartbreaking and infuriating that this deal has been on the table for over a year. And it's been Benjamin Netanyahu, because of his political considerations domestically, trying to protect himself, has frustrated the ability to find peace and to get the hostages home far before today. So again, this will be a good week, but as you have reported, there are big issues to come. Israel is not fully pulling out of Gaza. There is no clear path forward on what the security and governance force is going to look like inside that country. There is certainly a risk of hostilities beginning again if we don't build on this first phase and come to some decisions about what Gaza looks like heading into next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden wasn't willing to put this kind of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump has. Your point is that's got to be sustained pressure to see this all the way through. My understanding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Yeah. I mean, listen, I think the barrier here has been Netanyahu, and Netanyahu is only going to move if he thinks that his relationship with the United States is at risk. And so, clearly, the pressure is going to have to continue to be strong and constant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now let me ask you about the other diplomacy that needs to happen just up the street frankly. You have called on Democrats to stiffen their spines to stand up to the president of the United States. At what point, though, does this pain become too much in terms of the cost of the shutdown. And when are Democrats going to show some flexibility on this?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, I listened to the Vice President, and he's just not living in reality. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --\u00a0 What do you mean? --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- The fact is, well, because there's no negotiations happening right now because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations. They are boycotting negotiations to reopen the government because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy. Their only priority is protecting the billionaire class and the corporate class. The other reason the House of Representatives isn't in town right now trying to reopen the government, because they are about to have enough votes to pass a resolution mandating the release of the Epstein files. So JD Vance and Donald Trump's number one priority is protecting billionaires, protecting corporations and raising premiums, raising health care costs by 75% on American citizens. So yes, I think that Democrats should say if you want our votes for a budget, it can't be a corrupt budget. It can't be a budget that is going to devastate the lives of middle class families in this country in order to protect and reward billionaires. That's a pretty reasonable request.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the premiums that will increase an average of about $1,000, I believe, for those who are using some of these --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- That's the average, but in Connecticut, some families will see a $25,000 increase in premiums. And again, in order to afford a $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in this country. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because also it wasn't dealt with earlier when Democrats were in leadership here. But you did hear the Vice President say, when it came to health care, the administration is open to a discussion, we want to lower insurance premiums. That was a quote there. Did you hear any chance at an opening?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: I mean, there are no negotiations happening, in large part because the House of Representatives isn't even here. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- They've been on an unprecedented five week recess because they do not want to risk their billionaire tax cut and they also don't want to talk about the president's lawlessness. I mean, that's the other thing that we have to talk about in this budget. If we're going to fund this administration, we need to fund an administration that is paying attention to the law. I would be a sucker, Margaret, to vote for a budget that allows the president to then go and spend money only in states that are run by Republicans and spend no money in states that are run by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is just the seven week deal that we're talking about at this point, the short term funding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- Correct, the long term budget that we pass ultimately has to require that the president not engage in mass scale corruption. But a short term agreement, certainly is not going to fix all of the problems that exist right now in the way the President is running the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have been critical in the past of the tactic of choosing to shut down the government. You were in 2018, you were back in 2013 when it was a discussion over health care. This is what you said in 2018.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SEN. MURPHY: The future of the American health care system was a legitimate public policy issue, as is the security of our borders, but we shouldn't be having the discussion amidst a government shutdown, trying to use our nation's security and all of these federal workers and the work that they do as hostages.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't you doing today exactly what you were criticizing then?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, that was a fight over, sort of, the long term structure of the American health care system. This is an emergency. In about a month, premiums are going to go up by people by 75% and we have to make a decision whether this budget is going to allow for that to happen or to stop it. What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency. So we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do not--",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Those are urgent matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do not trust that if you vote to open the government and then have a separate conversation about health care, that there will be any follow through?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Absolutely not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that is what the vice president was arguing here, that it's like Democrats aren't even saying what it is they want to negotiate over.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, you cannot trust this administration. And I think it's important to remember that we didn't have a shutdown when Joe Biden was president, and the reason is because they didn't play the kind of games that Republicans are playing. Joe Biden and Democrats, when we were in charge of the Senate, negotiated with Republicans and avoided shutdowns. This shutdown is happening because Republicans are desperate to protect their billionaire tax cut. And all we are asking- we're not asking to fix the entire American health care system. We're simply saying, don't make things worse by raising premiums by people, in some cases, by $25,000 a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Minority Leader gave an interview to Punchbowl this week. I mean, there is just also the bare bones politics of this. And in that interview, he said, every day this goes on, every day gets better for us. The Speaker of the House said that was this callous statement.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, they're- they're sort of desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying. Listen, our priority is the American people. And yes, it is true, as every day--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been critical of Schumer in the past, back in March, you were saying, we've got to stand up and do something. Is this about the tactic of just saying, hey, we're standing up?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No. As every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are breaking with JD Vance and President Trump and saying, yes, we should be willing to sit down and talk about the health care crisis that is about to visit this country. There are more Republicans that are breaking with the president's regime of censorship. So as every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are willing to stand up and protect the American people, to try to stop the President's destruction of democracy, and hopefully at some point, there will be enough Republicans to join us and try to protect people's pocketbooks, which are about to be destroyed, their economic livelihoods are about to be destroyed, by these enormous increases in health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but in the meantime, there's also the not- not getting a paycheck problem for some of these people.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Where's the House of Representatives, Margaret? They're on vacation. The only way you can solve a shutdown is to have two parties that are in Washington negotiating. This is pretty simple. Republicans are boycotting negotiations. They're in the witness protection program all over the country, refusing to even show up for work. If they're serious about sitting down and reopening the government, they would be in Washington rather than spread out all over the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Appreciate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Vice President JD Vance that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin today with Vice President JD Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati, this morning. Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72 hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the President is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person. It's a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. The President of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel- which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive. It was a very tall task. He pursued a very non traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40 year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And of course, the President was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it. But I think that because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done. We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular, of this deal. Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 US troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here? And more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret. It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down. I know the President is very committed to doing that, but you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about, we see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace. One of the under reported elements of this deal Margaret is that the President convinced the entire Muslim world really both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety. And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground, we're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security. You said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that quote, \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\" Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been okay with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the President didn't agree with.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, look, as the President said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid. That's a difficult balance to strike, but I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded. They were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel. This is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world. It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government. There were more than 4,000 layoff notices called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the President described this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this so we'll get little taste of their own medicine.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on Margaret is ensuring essential services remain open, and obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low income women and children get the food services that they need. We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused, and unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about. We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer, the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs, that's why it's a little different this time, and specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector. CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case, but some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, so- so two- two responses to that, Margaret. First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well. But the second point, Margaret, is the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government. We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and- and to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats, have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos. So you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the President talking about that. That- that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does, and in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential- essential services stay on. But unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the- the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us. That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Anti Deficiency Act?",
      "JD VANCE: Well, we are confident. Margaret, of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret? All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff \u2013 we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation, because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government. If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the President of the United States. Only the five people, including the President, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the President insist that lawmakers come back to Washington sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving this shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate, and again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a deal maker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a deal making. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage taking. Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans. Of course, we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the President of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops. That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans, we want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats: we are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just a quick follow there. Though, what is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them. We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually Margaret, that's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0All right, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

The White House physician said Biden had a small skin lesion with cancerous tissue removed from his chest during his annual physical. Further testing confirmed it was basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer.",

      "\"Every family in Gaza has been affected by this,\" the official said. \"You read some of the public opinion of polls \u2014 the Gazans do not just blame Israel for this conflict. They, in large part, were blaming Hamas for it. We began to sense that turn in leverage.\"",
      "Within days, there would be a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, with the Turkish and Egyptian intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister.",
      "Friday, Oct. 3: in Miami, Kushner, Witkoff work on hostage releases",
      "In Florida, when Kushner heard Hamas had agreed to start talks on hostage releases, he drove 20 minutes to Witkoff's home in Miami, where they worked and fielded calls about the peace proposal, two administration officials said.",
      "Sunday, Oct. 5 - Monday, Oct. 6: Meetings in Sharm El Sheikh bring Hamas and Israel to the table",
      "Officials from Turkey, Qatar and Egypt sat down with Hamas and Israel at the table in Sharm El Sheikh on Oct. 5. Witkoff and Kushner set off for Sharm El Sheikh once they felt the tactical teams \"had done quite a bit.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8: Refining the peace plan",
      "Kushner and Witkoff arrived in Sharm El Sheikh at 6:30 a.m. local time and \"immediately went to work,\" according to one senior U.S. official. They spent \"a lot of time\" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.",
      "During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.",
      "Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an \"almost permanent ceasefire\" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.",
      "Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff.",
      "\"His message was, 'First, get it done,'\" a U.S. official said. He also reiterated that he stood behind every aspect of his 20-point plan.",
      "\"POTUS wanted people on both sides to understand that he was going to enforce good conduct here, and that was a critical and overarching message that we were there to talk about,\" this official said.",
      "\"We were going for, you know, 20 straight hours,\" one official said of the talks in Egypt.",
      "Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8, Wednesday evening: \"Serious breakthroughs\"",
      "\"We began to have some very, very serious breakthroughs with regard to all of these issues,\" the U.S. official said, prompting another meeting Wednesday night with Kushner, Witkoff and Middle East officials.",
      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",
      "5:30 p.m., Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 8 (2:30 a.m., Sharm El Sheikh, Thursday, Oct. 9): Announcing the deal",
      "Witkoff and Kushner felt they had dealt with all the issues and were ready to announce the deal. President Trump announced it in the U.S. on Truth Social.",
      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Witkoff and Kushner then traveled to Cairo, and met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to tell him he was needed for the implementation phase. After the El-Sisi meeting, Witkoff and Kushner flew to Tel Aviv.",
      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",
      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

    "story": [
      "Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca will offer U.S. patients discounted prices for some prescription drugs, President Trump announced Friday, the second major drug company to strike a deal with the Trump administration in recent weeks.",
      "Under the deal, AstraZeneca will offer its drugs to Medicaid patients at \"most-favored-nation\" prices, meaning the U.K.-based drugmaker will charge no more than the lowest rate offered in other high-income countries, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a Friday afternoon Oval Office event. AstraZeneca also promised to offer new prescription drugs at most-favored-nation rates, Oz said.",
      "AstraZeneca will also list \"all primary care medications\" on a government website called TrumpRx, and it will offer discounts for some drugs, including lung disease medication, according to Oz. The company said in a statement that it will offer drugs at up to an 80% discount for \"eligible patients with prescriptions for chronic diseases.\"",
      "TrumpRx \u2014 which is set to launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but will instead direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere, Oz said. AstraZeneca said the website will allow patients to buy drugs directly from the company at a \"reduced cash price.\"",
      "The AstraZeneca announcement came less than two weeks after Pfizer reached a similar deal to offer most-favored-nation rates to Medicaid patients and list drugs on TrumpRx.",
      "Policymakers have struggled with high prescription drug prices for decades. Members of both parties have floated proposals to tie drug prices to the typically much lower rates offered in other countries, but the idea faces legal impediments, and drugmakers have argued that price controls could make it harder for them to invest in research.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed some of the largest pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily offer drugs to Medicaid patients and new drugs at most-favored-nation rates, floating tighter regulations if companies do not comply. Separately, Mr. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals unless drugmakers are in the process of building U.S.-based plants. AstraZeneca on Friday announced plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing and research facilities.",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work, and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter, some experts caution.",
      "Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, told CBS News in reaction to the Pfizer deal.",
      "It's also unclear how many people would benefit from TrumpRx. For uninsured patients or those with high deductibles, such an option could matter, if their prescriptions are among those listed. But most people obtain their medications through insurance.",
      "\"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump,\" Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, told CBS News following the Pfizer agreement. \"Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\""

She said that in the aftermath of the crash, flying will never be the same for her, and the government shutdown gave her pause when she came to Capitol Hill this week to advocate for safety reforms.",
      "\"I trust that everyone who is going to work is doing their very best to keep us safe, but this is just not a functional way to govern,\" she told CBS News. \"We deserve better than this. We deserve that our essential systems, our transportation systems, stay open and that the folks who are responsible for keeping those safe are paid on time and that that doesn't become a football.\"",
      "Amid efforts in Congress to reform the nation's aviation system, Feres and other victims' family members have been meeting with lawmakers and Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. Feres' cousin Peter Livingston, his wife Donna and daughters Alydia and Everly died when an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Eagle flight over the Potomac River in January.",
      "\"Our message has been that aviation safety reform matters,\" Feres said. \"It matters to the American people. This is a nonpartisan issue. This is an American issue, and we all deserve to know that when we or our loved ones get on a plane, we get off again on the other side.\"",

      "Now, with biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service furloughed because of the shutdown, a critical release of 400 captive-bred ferrets, designed to strengthen their wild populations, is in jeopardy.",
      "\"It just really makes us all very nervous,\" said Chamois Andersen, a senior leader at Defenders of Wildlife, a key non-profit partner on the federal agency's Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan. \"It's not something we can play around with, in terms of the timing and the funding. It's that endangered of a species.\"",
      "The government has been partially shut down for more than a week after a budget standoff in Congress over federal spending limits and extending expiring tax credits for health insurance.",
      "Andersen warns the next two months are critical for successfully introducing the captive ferrets. Fall provides the essential window for new ferrets to hone their hunting skills and begin mating before winter arrives. While many won't survive the cold, those that do will help stabilize the fragile, wild population.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service maintains a captive breeding program facility in Fort Collins, Colorado, where many of the ferrets await release. The facility is currently at full capacity, Andersen said.",

Without ferrets, unchecked prairie dog colonies can throw the entire system out of balance, impacting dozens of other species.",
      "\"I always attribute it to a rug and you have a frayed edge. If you start to pull on that piece of the rug it really unravels fast,\" Andersen said. \"We just hope there can be some resolve to the shutdown and people can return to their jobs and reintroductions can go on as scheduled.\""

      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",

      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for research on seemingly obscure quantum tunneling that is advancing digital technology.",
      "Clarke, 83, conducted his research at the University of California, Berkeley; Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and Devoret at Yale and also at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "\"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters at the announcement by phone after being told of his win.",
      "He paid tribute to the other two laureates, saying that \"their contributions are just overwhelming.\"",

      "3 scientists win Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries in immunology",
      "\"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me.\"",
      "However, speaking from his cellphone, Clarke added: \"One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.''",
      "The Nobel committee said that the laureates' work in the 1980s continues to provide opportunities to develop \"the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.\"",
      "\"It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,\" said Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on and off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers. The prize winning trio's work helped take that into the larger world, where it has the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "What the three physicists did \"is taking the scale of something that we can't see, we can't touch, we can't feel and bringing it up to the scale of something recognizable and make it something you can build upon,\" said Physics Today editor-in-chief Richard Fitzgerald, who in the 1990s worked in the field on a competitors' group.",
      "\"Quantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they're also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\" Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "It is the 119th time the prize has been awarded. Last year, artificial intelligence pioneers John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the physics prize for helping create the building blocks of machine learning.",
      "On Monday, Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries about how the immune system knows to attack germs and not our bodies.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics on Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite who founded the prizes.",
      "The prizes carry priceless prestige and a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million)."

    "summary": "David Pogue looks at our nation's tradition of pioneering inventors, from Thomas Edison's R&amp;D facility in Menlo Park, N.J., to today's entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to \"Shark Tank.\"",
    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

      "The probe by the agency's Office of Defects Investigation involves Tesla vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised)\" and \"FSD (Beta)\" versions of the the company's self-driving systems. Both require \"a fully attentive driver who is engaged in the driving task at all times,\" NHTSA said in a document filed as part of the probe.",

      "NHTSA has received reports of 58 safety violations linked to Tesla vehicles with FSD. Those incidents include more than a dozen crashes and fires, along with 23 injuries, according to the agency.",
      "U.S. regulators have  been investigating Tesla's automated driving systems for more than three years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns, such as\u00a0a Seattle-area Tesla crash\u00a0in 2024 involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist.",
      "\"The ultimate question is, 'Does the software work?'\" asked Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst with a \"sell\" rating on Tesla shares stock.",
      "Such problems have led lawmakers and safety regulators to question whether Tesla's automated system and other like it will ever be able to operate safely on a widespread scale. A new law in California that would hold driverless car companies accountable for traffic violations is set to\u00a0take effect next year.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \"summon\" technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",
      "Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla allegedly has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.",
      "CEO Elon Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not fixed such problems. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.",
      "Tesla shares fell 1.4% Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "summary": "Crucial for marine life and the global economy, coral reefs are the planet's first major environmental system to cross a climate \"tipping point\" as the world warms.",
    "story": [
      "Coral reefs around the globe have for years suffered publicly in warming oceans, periodically making headlines when iconic underwater landscapes lose their colors and wither during repeated mass bleaching events caused by climate change. Now, reefs are the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate \"tipping point,\" according to a new report by climate scientists who call the situation an \"unprecedented crisis.\"",
      "Researchers at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute in England have released their second Global Tipping Points report, which examines some of the fundamental processes that support life on this planet in terms of their proximity to benchmarks that may signal permanent damage.",
      "\"Tipping points represent critical thresholds in Earth's climate system where small changes can lead to significant, often irreversible consequences,\" the authors said in their report. Steve Smith, a research fellow at the Global Systems Institute and one of the report's co-authors, told CBS News that tipping points are \"all about that point at which change becomes self-propelling, kind of a self-accelerating change.\"",
      "The report, published Sunday, comes three years after the institute released its first iteration in 2022 and about a month before the United Nations hosts COP30, an annual climate change conference, in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, a city in the Amazon rainforest that is itself an example of a major global ecosystem on the brink of a climate emergency. Tim Lenton, the director of the Global Systems Institute and lead author of the report, said in a statement that he hopes his team's findings make it onto the agenda.",
      "\"We are rapidly approaching multiple Earth system tipping points that could transform our world, with devastating consequences for people and nature,\" his statement said. \"This demands immediate, unprecedented action from leaders at COP30 and policymakers worldwide.\"",
      "The 2015 Paris Agreement set upper limits for global warming at 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius \u2014 between 2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 above average levels in preindustrial times. But leaders have repeatedly warned in the years since that countries are falling short of the emissions targets necessary to meet those temperature goals, with the U.N. declaring greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere reached all-time highs in 2023. By 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported temperatures had risen to about 1.4 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average.",
      "\"A new reality\"",
      "Higher ocean temperatures have already degraded coral reefs, which are crucial for marine life and provide habitats for roughly one-fourth of all underwater species. The new report points out that reefs also support the livelihoods of about a billion people, so their deterioration is as much an economic threat as an environmental one.",
      "Scientists have determined that the \"tipping point\" for coral reefs begins when global warming reaches about 1.2 degrees Celsius, with somewhere between 70 and 90% of coral dying when that number climbs to 1.5 degrees.",
      "\"We're very confident that, unfortunately, we're in the middle of the coral reef dieback,\" Smith said, which, he explained, essentially means \"the collapse of coral reefs worldwide.\"",
      "Reef death is often catalyzed by bleaching, when heat stress causes coral to purge the colorful algae that sustains it and, in turn, become pale and weak. If the stress persists and bleaching is severe or prolonged, the coral can completely break down.",
      "The International Coral Reef Initiative announced in April that an estimated 84% of the world's coral reefs were under heat stress. As the new report notes, this is \"the most extensive and intense\" mass bleaching event ever recorded.",
      "Small pockets of coral are expected to survive, Smith said, and preserving them while minimizing the progression of warming temperatures should be everyone's top priority.",
      "\"We're in a new reality whereby we can now say that we've passed the first major climate tipping point, which is the coral reefs,\" he said. \"And obviously we'll have to, as we say, try to reduce the damage.

      "Other environmental systems are on the verge of passing their tipping points, too, according to the report. In addition to coral reefs, it cited the potentially catastrophic effects of a warming world on the Amazon rainforest, ocean currents that influence weather patterns, and glaciers like the Greenland ice sheet, which is currently melting and shedding the equivalent of three Niagara Falls' worth of freshwater into the North Atlantic every hour.",
      "\"It's a race against time, really,\" said Smith. \"We have to transform the whole energetic basis of society within a generation, away from fossil fuels and toward this cleaner, safer future to avoid these further tipping points beyond coral reefs and the devastating consequences that they would bring.\"",
      "The report acknowledged meaningful headway has been made in the shift toward renewable energy, highlighting \"positive tipping points\" that have been crossed as the use of electric vehicles, solar power and wind power becomes more widespread. The rise of solar power, in particular, is one positive transition that Smith singled out as especially \"remarkable\" \u2014 although he emphasized that more still needs to be done, urgently, to bring the Earth back on track.",
      "\"Getting that into the heads of our senior decision-makers is going to be important,\" said Smith, \"because what is traditionally thought of as high impact, low likelihood events, they're actually becoming high impact, high likelihood, if we don't do something now.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance on Sunday accused Democrats of \"hostage-taking\" with their posture in the government shutdown, as Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
      "\"We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Twelve days into the government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the impasse, without a clear resolution in sight. As Senate Republican leadership has held repeat votes on a House-passed measure to fund the government, looking to peel off support from across the aisle, Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support to reopen the government. And as Democrats call for negotiations in the funding fight, Republican leaders say there's nothing to negotiate.",
      "When asked Sunday about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the stalemate would only be solved by negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House, Vance said \"this isn't a deal-making, this isn't a negotiation, this is hostage-taking.\"",
      "\"If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans,\" Vance said. \"But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, 'unless you the President of the United States give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government.'\"",
      "Vance added, \"we'll negotiate over health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up people's government.\"",
      "On the question of the health insurance tax credits, Vance said \"we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry, so we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House,\" Vance said. \"But if the far-left Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage-taking. And we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Meanwhile on Friday, the White House announced that layoffs previewed earlier in the shutdown had begun, and the administration said in a court filing that seven agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices to more than 4,000 workers.",
      "Vance said the government is focused on \"ensuring essential services remain open\" when asked how the administration is deciding who gets laid off. And he urged that \"this is not a situation that we're excited about,\" saying \"we want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.\"",
      "Pressed about the layoffs, some of which were rescinded, Vance said \"the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\"",
      "\"We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\" Vance said. \"That chaos is because Schumer and the far-left Democrats shut down the government.\"",
      "On whether the layoffs can hold up to legal scrutiny after two unions sued to block the mass layoffs during the shutdown, Vance said, \"we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do.\"",
      "\"All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government,\" Vance said. \"If they just join with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all these conversations will no longer be necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said Vance is \"just not living in reality.\"",
      "\"There's no negotiations happening right now, because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations,\" Murphy said, arguing they are doing so \"because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\"",
      "Murphy said \"this is an emergency.\"",
      "\"We have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,\" Murphy said. \"Those are urgent matters.\""

      "But I think that, because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done, we are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular of this deal.",
      "Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 U.S. troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here?",
      "And, more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret.",
      "It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the president of the United States on down. I know the president is very committed to doing that.",
      "But you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here.",
      "There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about. We see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace.",
      "One of the underreported elements of this deal, Margaret, is that the president convinced the entire Muslim world really, both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety.",
      "And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground.",
      "We're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and, of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security, you said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\"",
      "Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been OK with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the president didn't agree with?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, look, as the president said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser-focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid.",
      "That's a difficult balance to strike. But I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states, really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded, they were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel, this is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world.",
      "It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100 percent sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening, when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government.",
      "There were more than 4,000 layoff notices, called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements, that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the president described this.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this, so we'll give them a little taste of their own medicine.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on, Margaret, is ensuring essential services remain open.",
      "And, obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low-income women and children get the food services that they need.",
      "We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops, because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused. And, unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about.",
      "We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs. That's why it's a little different this time.",
      "And specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector, CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case.",
      "But some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, so \u2013 so two \u2013 two responses to that, Margaret.",
      "First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well.",
      "But the second point, Margaret, is, the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government.",
      "We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and \u2013 and, to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the president talking about that. That \u2013 that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does.",
      "And, in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential \u2013 essential services stay on.",
      "But, unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the \u2013 the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us.",
      "That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Antideficiency Act?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, we are confident, Margaret.",
      "Of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret?",
      "All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed Leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the president of the United States.",
      "Only the five people, including the president, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the president insist that lawmakers come back to Washington, sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving the shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate and, again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a dealmaker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans, like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a dealmaking. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage-taking.",
      "Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that, unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans.",
      "Of course we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the president of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low-income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops.",
      "That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle \u2013 you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans.",
      "We want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats. We are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, just a quick follow there, though. What is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.",
      "We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that, if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And, again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually, Margaret.",
      "That's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation. That's a hostage-taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",

      "DR. BADR ABDELATTY (Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs): Good to be with you, Margaret. Thank you so much for hosting me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump is headed to Egypt. I know he will be meeting with President El-Sisi tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss this agreement about Gaza.",
      "But everything seems dependent on this hostage release and the conclusion of phase one. From what you know and hear from Hamas, will those hostages be released in the next 24 hours?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, we are confident that the first phase of the Trump peace plan will be implemented, will be honored by all parts concerns.",
      "And we are moving ahead. We are very hopeful that the first phase will be completed in all honesty from the two parties. And we are in full contact with the Palestinians, with the Hamas, because it's all about, of course, releasing the hostages and, for Israel, releasing some of the Palestinian detainees, returning back some \u2013 I mean, the bodies of the \u2013 those who passed away.",
      "But that will take time to collect the remains, of course, and to allow the flow of all humanitarian assistance to Gaza without impediments in order to deal with current famine and starvation in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vice president, who you just heard, said that President Trump has convinced a number of countries to provide ground troops to go into Gaza. Will Egypt be sending ground troops into Gaza?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, part of the deal is, of course, the issue of security arrangement. And we are working on different levels.",
      "First of all, there are some Palestinians in Gaza. They will be trained and be deployed in Gaza. We are in the process now, as we speak, providing training and coordination with Jordan to train up to 5,000 Palestinians to be deployed in Gaza as well.",
      "Deployment of international force is on the table. We are supporting this idea, of course. And there are some countries expressed their readiness to deploy forces to contribute with the forces on the ground. And we have to work now on going to the Security Council, of course, to endorse the proposal, as well as defining\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 the main mandate of these troops on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader of Indonesia is already committed to 20,000 troops. Is Egypt going to commit troops? Do you have a number?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: We are. We are going to support and to commit troops within specific parameters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: As I mentioned, we must have a mandate by the Security Council to endorse it and, of course, to specify the mission of the troops on the ground, which will be peacekeeping, and how to provide training to the Palestinian policemen in order to do their job, to have law enforcement on the ground, and, of course, to define the whole mission\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 and for how long, because it will be a transitional one, in order to help the Palestinians to assume their full responsibilities and to \u2013 until we have the realization of the Palestinian state on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are committing there to a Palestinian state. The president of the United States has given a bit more vague language.",
      "And when I pressed the secretary of state on this point just last weekend, he said this is far off in the future. How long do you think it's going to take before Palestinians are ruling Gaza and that we will see a state?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, what's very urgent now is, of course, ending this war on the innocent civilians in Gaza, provide as much as \u2013 food and medicine to the people there.",
      "And then we have to move forward with regard to the early recovery and the reconstructions of Gaza, and, of course, talking about issues related to the governance and the security arrangement in Gaza.",
      "And, of course, from our point of view, the endgame, the final comprehensive solution will be the realization of the Palestinian state, because, without that, we are confident through \u2013 we have to draw lessons from the past that, without solving the Palestinian cause, which is the core of the conflict in the region, without respecting the legitimate aspirations\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 of the Palestinians to have their own statehood, there is no peace and stability in the region.",
      "And the Trump peace plan, it refers to the statehood. And, of course, 144 countries voted in favor of\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 the two-state solution in New York recently.",

      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: So, this is the game in town.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it \u2013 again, that's going to seemingly take a lot of time.",
      "I want to go back to the question of security, because it is essential for rebuilding, and share with you some of what the United Nations estimates here. The U.N. says 92 percent of housing units in Gaza are destroyed or damaged. Almost 92 percent of schools will require full reconstruction or rehab; 77 percent of the total road network has been damaged; 86 percent of total cropland is destroyed.",
      "How much is this going to cost, and where is this money coming from?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, first of all, we have full confidence on the leadership of President Trump and his vision for peace.",
      "He's the only person who is capable to end the war and to open a new chapter in the Middle East, a chapter of hope, of prosperity and peace for all peoples, including, of course, the Israeli people, the Palestinians and all peoples in our region. So we are very appreciative, who are commending his leadership, and we are in full support of his vision and his leadership.",
      "This is one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Number two, we are working very hard now with regard to convening an international conference in cooperation between Egypt and the United States, as well as with a lot of partners, including Germany, European Union, France\u2026",

      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 Italy, Spain, Qatar, Gulf Cooperation Council, Japan. Everybody is standing ready to participate in this conference for the reconstruction and redevelopment of Gaza.",

Forty=eight hostages, living and dead, will be exchanged for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 detained since October, 2023. The deadline is Monday.

      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, it's really important that we have a ceasefire. It's important that these hostages are coming home. And I congratulate the negotiators on getting this done. There's \u2013 there's no politics about this moment, as you're going to see some very tearful reunions tomorrow, hopefully, as these hostages are released.",
      "But you watch those devastating images of what Gaza looks like today, and it's both heartbreaking and infuriating that this deal has been on the table for over a year, and it's been Benjamin Netanyahu, because of his political considerations, domestically, trying to protect himself, has frustrated the ability to find peace and to get the hostages home far before today.",
      "So, again, this will be a good week. But as you have reported, there are big issues to come. Israel is not fully pulling out of Gaza. There's no clear path forward on what the security and governance force is going to look like inside that country. There's certainly a risk of hostilities begin again if we don't build on this first phase and come to some decisions about what Gaza looks like heading into next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden wasn't willing to put this kind of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump has. Your point is, that's got to be sustained pressure to see this all the way through. Am I understanding you?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: I mean, listen, I think the barrier here has been Netanyahu. And Netanyahu is only going to move if he thinks that his relationship with the United States is at risk. And so clearly, the pressure is going to have to continue to be strong and constant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, let me ask you about the other diplomacy that needs to happen just up the street, frankly. You have called on Democrats to stiffen their spines, to stand up to the president of the United States. At what point, though, does this pain become too much in terms of the cost of the shutdown, and when are Democrats going to show some flexibility on this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, I listened to the vice president, and he's just not living in reality. The fact \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, because there's no negotiations happening right now because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations. They are boycotting negotiations to reopen the government because they are desperate to raise premiums on people on this country by 75 percent in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy. Their only priority is protecting the billionaire class and the corporate class.",
      "The other reason the House of Representatives isn't in town right now trying to reopen the government, because they are about to have enough votes to pass a resolution mandating the release of the Epstein files.",

      "So, yes, I think that Democrats should say, if you want our votes for a budget, it can't be a corrupt budget. It can't be a budget that is going to devastate the lives of middle class families in this country in order to protect and reward billionaires. That's a pretty reasonable request.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the premiums that will increase an average of about $1,000, I believe, for those who are using some of these health care programs through the government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, that's the average. But in Connecticut, some families will see a $25,000 increase in premiums. And again, in order to afford a $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because also it wasn't dealt with earlier when Democrats were in leadership here.",
      "But you \u2013 but you did hear the vice president say, when it came to healthcare, \"the administration is open to a discussion. We want to lower insurance premiums.\" That was a quote there. Did you hear any chance of an opening?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: I mean, there are no negotiations happening, in large part because the House of Representatives isn't even here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: They've been on an unprecedented five-week recess because they do not want to risk their billionaire tax cut. And they also don't want to talk about the president's lawlessness. I mean, that's the other thing that we have to talk about in this budget. If we're going to fund this administration, we need to fund an administration that is paying attention to a law.",
      "I would be a sucker, Margaret, to vote for a budget that allows the president to then go and spend money only in states that are run by Republicans and spend no money in states that are run by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is just the seven-week deal that we're talking about at this point. The \u2013 the short-term funding.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Correct. The long \u2013 right, the long-term budget that we pass \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Ultimately has to require that the president not engage in mass-scale corruption. But a short-term agreement, you know, certainly is not going to fix all of the problems that exist right now in the way the president is running the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have been critical in the past of the tactic of choosing to shut down the government. You were in 2018. You were back in 2013, when it was a discussion over healthcare. This is what you said in 2018.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: The future of the American healthcare system was a legitimate public policy issue, as is the security of our borders. But we shouldn't be having the discussion amidst a government shutdown and trying to use our nation's security and all of these federal workers and the work that they do as hostages.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't you doing today exactly what you were criticizing then?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No. That was a fight over sort of the long-term structure of the American healthcare system. This is an emergency. In about a month, premiums are going to go up by people by 75 percent. And we have to make a decision of whether this budget is going to allow for that happen \u2013 to happen or to stop it.",
      "What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency. So, we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are going to \u2013 about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country. Those are urgent matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do not \u2013 you do not trust that if you vote to open the government and then have a separate conversation about healthcare, that there will be any follow-through?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Absolutely not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that is what the vice president was arguing here, that it's like, Democrats aren't even saying what it is they want to negotiate over.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No, you \u2013 you cannot trust this administration. And I think it's important to remember that we didn't have a shutdown when Joe Biden was president. And the reason is, because they didn't play the kind of games that Republicans are playing. Joe Biden and Democrats, when we were in charge of the Senate, negotiated with Republicans and avoided shutdowns. This shutdown is happening because Republicans are desperate to protect their billionaire tax cut. And all we are asking \u2013 we're not asking to fix the entire American health care system \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: We're just simply saying, don't make things worse by raising premiums by people, in some cases by $25,000 a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the minority leader gave an interview to \"Punchbowl\" this week. I mean, there is just also the bare bones politics of this. And in that interview he said, \"Every day this goes on, every day gets better for us.\" The speaker of the House said that was a callous statement.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, they're \u2013 they're sort of desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying.",
      "Listen, our priority is the American people. And, yes, it is true, as every day \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been critical of Schumer in the past. Back in March, you were saying, we've got to stand up and do something. Is this about the tactic of just saying, hey, we're standing up?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No. As every day goes on there are more Republicans that are breaking with J.D. Vance and President Trump in saying, yes, we should be willing to sit down and talk about the health care crisis that is about to visit this country. There are more Republicans that are breaking with the president's regime of censorship. So, as every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are willing to stand up and protect the American people, to try to stop the president's destruction of democracy, and hopefully at some point there will be enough Republicans to join us and try to protect people's pocketbooks, which are about to be destroyed \u2013 their economic livelihoods are about to be destroyed by these enormous increase in health care costs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but, in the meantime, there's also the not \u2013 not getting a paycheck problem for some of these (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Where is the House of Representatives, Margaret? They're on vacation. The only way you can solve a shutdown is to have two parties that are in Washington negotiating. This is pretty simple. Republicans are boycotting negotiations. They're in the witness protection program all over the country, refusing to even show up for work. If they're serious about sitting down to reopen the government, they would be in Washington, rather than spread out all over the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, thank you for your time.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Appreciate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "You are the House lawmaker in town. But \u2013 but I want to talk to you about your intelligence portfolio.",
      "\"The Financial Times\" is reporting right now that the United States is helping Ukraine to target Russian oil installations. In other words, hitting Russia right in that pocketbook.",
      "What can you say in regard to how the Trump administration is changing its policy? Are they truly now standing up to Vladimir Putin?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, not really, right? We've heard now for months that we're two weeks away, I think that's the president's terminology he used several times now over many months from really cracking down on Russia. And, of course, you know, there are bipartisan bills in the Congress right now which would impose very severe sanctions on the Russians that would do a lot to stop the export of their oil, which, of course, is the fuel that drives their war machine, the dollars that drive their war machine. Those have not been moved forward by the White House. So, it's hard to say that President Trump is doing anything other than what he's done forever when he was president, which is trying to sort of have it \u2013 have it both ways.",
      "Now, I will say, and I can't get into particular attacks or particular authorities that the government has, but these attacks on the refineries have had the effect of reducing Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other stuff almost by 20 percent. That really, really hurts the Russians. And I will tell you, again without being specific, that I wish the president would be much more aggressive with respect to turning off those taps and with respect to arming the Ukrainians.",
      "But he hasn't taken any meaningful step back \u2013 steps back from the Biden administration. So, we've at least got that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not so much that he's doing more, it's that perhaps he's freeing up more to be done by the Ukrainian military, not putting the same restrictions on them that he had been? Is that fair to say?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, again, I don't want to get \u2013 don't want to get specific with respect to authorities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But, you know, his rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians, and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient. By the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient. But they haven't been consistent with his very skeptical rhetoric. I haven't noticed a dramatic change, pull back, if you will, from the Biden administration with respect to our assistance o the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you because Zelenskyy and Trump spoke twice in the past 48 hours, which is notable.",
      "Venezuela, there are close to \u2013 the numbers we've seen are like 6,000 or so service people in the southern command region of operations. There have been four U.S. strikes on vessels. The U.S. says 21 people killed. You have been asking for legal justification from the administration to explain their actions. And you did it along with the head of Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security. Can you, in any way, compel more information sharing so the U.S. knows what is being done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, I mean \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) public (ph), I should say.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: One of the many troubling aspects about these lethal attacks in the Caribbean against supposedly drug dealing boats, now, we don't know that because, unlike our counterterrorism programs, the Congress is not being told who are on these boats, how they were identified, what the intelligence was. Totally different thing.",
      "Congress is being told nothing on this. And that's OK, apparently, with the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. It's not OK with me.",
      "I'm going to leave a little bit of a crack in the door here because, again, the White House has not shared what they believe their legal justification is. They did put out a memo. I will tell you that based on what I know now and the reading of that memo, these are illegal killings. They are illegal killings because the notion that the United States \u2013 and this is what the administration says is their justification, is involved in an armed conflict with any drug dealers, Venezuelan drug dealers, is ludicrous. It wouldn't stand up in a single court of law. It's what \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they've designated them as terrorists, therefore they can use those (INAUDIBLE).",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There's lots of people who have been designated terrorists. That does not automatically give the authority to take lethal action.",
      "So, their legal justifications are laughable. And what \u2013 and again, unless they want to share more than what they've shared with me, these are illegal killings. And what \u2013 what amazes me about that is that the president, of course, thanks to this very compliant Supreme Court, has been given absolute immunity. But what about the secretary of defense? What about the deputy \u2013 what about everybody else in that chain of command, right on down to the guy who's pulling a trigger that results in the deaths of people without clear, legal authority, what about them?",
      "Test me on this. It wouldn't surprise me if in the next couple of years there are presidential pardons offered to that entire chain of command because it is not at all clear \u2013 well, it is getting increasingly clear that these are \u2013 that these are illegal killings.",
      "Setting aside the law for a second, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, I don't know this because they're not telling Congress anything, but the press has all sorts of rumors that the first attack was on a boat that had turned around and was fleeing. Even if this were a legitimate, military action, which it's not because the Congress hasn't approved it, you know, firing on a fleeing enemy would be a violation on our laws of armed conflict. My Republican friends are saying, but these are terrible people doing terrible things. OK, I don't disagree with you on that, but are we now in the business of killing people who are doing bad things without authority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 are you saying that these were not lawful orders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Again \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That, in fact, the military was carrying \u2013 because what we constantly hear from our military leaders is, do not worry, our United States military is going to be reliant on the Constitution and only carry out lawful orders. Are you saying that these members of the military, who were the trigger pullers, did something else?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I am saying that to all appearances, these are illegal killings. And you can get a thousand different lawyers of both parties on this show to tell you that at best the legal authorities are questionable.",
      "So, I am fascinated by why the chain of command is so confident that the lethal activities they're taking are legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: They don't look that way to me. And this is a big deal, right? I mean, I understand that right now we're in a very polarizing environment, so it's going to be very hard for a Republican colleague of mine to make the statements that I have just made.",
      "But the worm (ph) turns, Margaret. You know, in 1968, we prosecuted \u2013 convicted of murder a lieutenant. Lieutenant Cali (ph), because he and his unit killed probably hundreds of people in Meli (ph), in Vietnam, and there were prosecutions after that. So, I'm a little fascinated about why that chain of command is so comfortable undertaking killings just because the Trump administration says, oh, it's OK. Not an administration that is known for their adherence to the law or to the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, that is a huge topic, and I want to continue covering that with you. But I need to ask you as well about the shutdown and the cost in your home state.",
      "We saw from just USAA, which is a lender and a bank to many people who work for the federal government, they said that they've had to provide $150 million in no interest loans to 4,500 people in just over 48 hours. That's a cash crunch for a lot of people.",
      "What's happening in Connecticut?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, I mean, I'll tell you a Connecticut story. The day after the shutdown went into effect, I went up to see the National Guard at Windsor Locks Airport. We were deploying 500 Connecticut National Guard members to the Middle East. These were 22, 23-year-olds. None of them are wealthy. None of them are going to get paid on October 15th. And I heard the vice president on your show say that this is about the Democrats. The American people understand that the Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, and they control the House. So, when the vice president of the United States is saying, this is all about Chuck Schumer, who the American people rejected in the last election, I think the American people see through that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House seems to be trying to take that issue off the table. The president posted on social media that they're going to repurpose funds somehow to pay the military, at least for this pay cycle. Is that sustainable? Is that legal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, probably not. Again, we just had a little conversation about the White House's understanding of United States law, which is \u2013 which is \u2013 which is pretty tentative to say the best.",
      "The speaker of the House, because I think to pay the military during a shut down, would require legislation. The speaker of the House has taken that off the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As it has in the past.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, I mean, is Donald Trump going to say a bunch of stuff? Yes, he's going to say a bunch of stuff. But I don't see anything moving. The House, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the House is, you know, on vacation. So, no, I don't see \u2013 think that that's very likely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the speaker says if the government wasn't shut down, the military would be getting a pay if Democrats voted for the short term funding bill. But no one's working right now, as you just said.",
      "We'll have to continue to track this.",
      "Thank you, Congressman Himes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be lack in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "Sacramento is where my thinking began about equality, liberty, and freedom. My wife, Mary, was also born and raised in Sacramento. We share cherished memories of younger years, school days, our wedding in 1963, and raising our three children in the city we loved. Sacramento is the place where we stood, in both the real and symbolic sense, to find beginnings and discover perspectives beyond. It is where my father practiced law, and where I \u2014 far too soon \u2014 stepped into his place to take over his practice. It is where my time on the bench began, and where so many of my beliefs about our country, about the rule of law, and about the world were formed.",
      "The West, of course, was imperfect, and is imperfect. Neither the place nor the concept was anything close to idyllic. There were and are scorpions and snakes aplenty. On the frontier, just as in other places, racial, ideological, and gender prejudice were all too common and injurious. But perhaps more than elsewhere, the frontier contained the promise of something better, the promise of community, of tolerance, of growth and ambition, all tempered by the realms in which the reality fell short, many of which are discussed in the pages ahead. But it is in the West where I learned to see people as individuals, beyond their race or religion or gender, beyond whom they loved or how they chose to live their lives, beyond the elements that could have driven us apart. I began to try to understand the common beliefs that brought us together.",
      "Only 116 men and women in our nation's history have served as justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. Growing up, it was easy to think of these justices as beyond reproach. And the inequity that they were all white men at the time was slow to dawn upon me. But my image was of nine sages behind closed doors, ruling on some of the most central, and potentially divisive, issues in society. And then, one day, after years spent practicing law, teaching, and then judging on the Ninth Circuit bench, suddenly one of the nine was me.",
      "Reality set in: I hoped to still be the person I had always been. A husband, a father, a diligent reader. But still just a fallible person. For all my years on the bench \u2014 and it gives me pride to say that my service as a justice on the Court was the fifteenth longest in U.S. history \u2014 I took the responsibility seriously, as did each of my colleagues, no matter how much and how often we agreed or disagreed. In doing my best to interpret and apply the Constitution and the law to the cases that came before us, my hope was that my life in the West would help give me the perspective needed to be honest and fair.",
      "Growing up in the West taught me, for example, that the creative energies of a great people cannot be realized unless the realms of economic freedom and personal liberty are respected. It reminded me that central to an individual's claim to personal liberty is the right to fair treatment and to be protected from arbitrary government action. The West reminded me that the most successful businessperson and the lowest-paid worker are each entitled to this basic dignity, a dignity that helped Americans build the frontier and continues to help us today.",
      "The West is so central to my self-understanding that it seems an appropriate place to begin. This Western boy did later go East. But my hope was to stay always close to those Western ideas of liberty and justice. This memoir is my way of putting those ideas on paper, of explaining how a Western boy became a lawyer, a judge, and a justice, seeking always to honor our country's founding principles and to do so with civility, hard work, tolerance, and the ethical foundation our nation must preserve.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 10:26:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The former justice who was the deciding vote on some of the Supreme Court's most consequential decisions talks about the Court today, and about his memoir, \"Life, Law & Liberty.\"",
    "story": [
      "Former Justice Anthony Kennedy loves to show guests around his art-filled chambers, but beneath that gentlemanly charm is the steel that once made him a force on the Supreme Court. He showed a visitor a statue of the Pony Express: \"And when Ronald Reagan was Governor, and he saw it and loved it, I said, 'You're not Queen Mary. I don't have to give it to you!'\"",
      "Kennedy, now 89 years old, no longer hears Supreme Court cases. He formally stepped down seven years ago during the first Trump administration. \"I loved sitting on the bench,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether he would want to be there today, he replied, \"The only reason I left \u2013 I love the Court \u2013 but I left for something that I love more, which is my wife, Mary.\"",
      "Kennedy now has time for his wife and family \u2013 and time to look back. In a new memoir, \"Life, Law & Liberty\" (to be published Tuesday by Simon & Schuster), Kennedy details how growing up in the West shaped his remarkable legal career, from private practice and teaching law in Sacramento, to sitting on the highest court in the country.",
      "\"I was born in the West and embraced that Western spirit,\" he writes. \"Sacramento is where my thinking began about equality, liberty and freedom.\"",
      "Asked if he ever imagined himself sitting on the Supreme Court, Kennedy replied, \"No, or on any court in fact. My father was a solo practitioner, and I took over his solo practice. Actually it took over me. And I had no time to see the kids growing up.\"",
      "So when then-Governor Ronald Reagan asked Kennedy if he would be interested in a federal judgeship, he said yes. \"President Ford had asked him who his recommendation would be, and it seemed to me a good way to be able to spend more time with my family,\" he said.",
      "At just 38 years of age, Kennedy became the youngest judge on the 9th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, but soon discovered that sitting on the bench had its own challenges. Just months after Kennedy was sworn in, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme was charged with the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford. Judge Kennedy presided over her bail hearing. \"Because I was the circuit judge and happened to be in Sacramento that day or that week,\" he said. On the question of whether Fromme should be allowed bail, Kennedy said, \"It took me probably ten seconds to decide no.\"",
      "But just days later, Kennedy says his home in Sacramento was broken into and vandalized. And though he couldn't prove it, he always suspected there was a link.  \"It was terrifying,\" he said. \"Fortunately our U.S. marshals are very good, and nothing happened.\"",
      "More than a decade later, Reagan \u2013 now president \u2013 reached out again, this time with a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Reagan's first pick, Robert Bork, had been rejected by the Senate, and his second, Douglas Ginsburg, had dropped out. Kennedy, the third choice, said yes, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Professor Jamal Greene, who teaches constitutional law at Columbia University, said, \"I think you could make an argument for saying that Justice Kennedy, in his time, was the most influential justice, maybe even in the history of the Court.\"",
      "",
      "Greene got to know Kennedy in 2006 while clerking for another justice on the Court, John Paul Stevens. \"He definitely was a bit of an iconoclast in the sense that he sometimes went with the conservatives, but very often went with the liberal bloc as well,\" Greene said.",
      "And as the \"swing justice\" on the Court, says Greene, Kennedy cast the deciding vote on some of the most consequential political and cultural issues of his era: the 2000 Presidential election, gun ownership, abortion rights, and same-sex marriage.",
      "Greene said, \"One way of measuring that is, the year I was on the Court, there were 25 5-4 decisions, and Justice Kennedy was in the majority in every single one. And there's certainly no one else who came close to that.\"",
      "Kennedy did not take his power lightly. A devout Catholic, he considered resigning from the Court in 1992 while deciding Planned Parenthood v. Casey, but ultimately joined with liberal justices to uphold a woman's right to an abortion.",
      "He said, \"It just seemed to me that this was the woman's right, and that what people of my belief should do is to convince her not to have the abortion, to convince her \u2026 but that she should have the right.\"",
      "Kennedy also wrote the decision in 2015 that recognized same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges: \"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family.\"",
      "Kennedy said, \"Someone told me it passed the refrigerator test, [which means] if there's something that's interesting and well-written, you put it on your refrigerator.\"",
      "All of Kennedy's opinions, says Greene, reflect a common theme: \"If you saw a Supreme Court opinion and saw the words 'freedom' and 'liberty' in the first paragraph, you could be pretty sure that Justice Kennedy was the person who had written that,\" he said.",
      "But since Kennedy stepped down, Greene says, his legacy has begun to fade. In 2022, the Supreme Court (including two of his former clerks, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh) reversed Roe v. Wade, ending the federal right to abortion. In his opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the decision behind Roe v. Wade was \"egregiously wrong,\" and that the opinion Kennedy wrote in Planned Parenthood v. Casey \"perpetuated its errors.\"",
      "To which Kennedy says, \"I stand by what we wrote and what we decided. It's a difficult issue.\"",
      "He also noted it is quite infrequent for the Court to overrule one of its own decisions.",
      "It may not be the last Kennedy opinion that's reversed. A petition has already been filed asking the Court to reconsider the case that legalized same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Today, Kennedy spends a lot of time with his own \"nine\" \u2013 his grandchildren \u2013 and while he is careful not to criticize the current justices, he admits he worries that some members of the Court may be too public with their differences: \"I'm actually somewhat concerned about the Court,\" he said. \"It's a little bit too personal and confrontational, some of the opinions. I'm hoping that will settle down a little bit.\"",
      "I asked, \"You do write a lot about how important civility is, and ethics. Do you think we've lost sight of that today? Is that another reason why you wrote this book?\"",
      "\"Yes, I'm concerned,\" he replied. \"Democracy presumes an open, rational, thoughtful, decent discussion where you respect the dignity of the person with whom you disagree. And if it doesn't have that, then democracy as we know it is in danger.\"",

      "Luigi Mangione's lawyers asked a New York judge to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count for which he could face the death penalty, from a federal indictment brought against him in the December assassination of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "In papers filed Saturday in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers said prosecutors should also be prevented from using at trial his statements to law enforcement officers and his backpack, in which a gun and ammunition were found.",
      "They said Mangione was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers, who arrested him after Thompson was fatally shot as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024.",
      "They added that officers did not obtain a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack.",
      "Mangione's lawyers want death penalty off the table",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting.",
      "The killing set off a multi-state search after the suspected shooter slipped away from the scene and rode a bike to Central Park, before taking a taxi to a bus depot that offers service to several nearby states.",
      "Five days later, a tip from a McDonald's about 233 miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since.",
      "In September, lawyers for Mangione asked that his federal charges be dismissed and the death penalty be taken off the table as a result of public comments by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\"",
      "Last month, a Manhattan Criminal Court judge\u00a0dismissed Mangione's state terrorism charges after his lawyers argued the parallel cases amounted to double jeopardy.",
      "Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other \"crimes of violence.\" It's the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it's not used in New York state.",
      "The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime -- stalking -- is not a crime of violence.",
      "The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.",
      "After the killing, investigators found the words \"delay,\" \"deny\" and \"depose,\" written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics."

      "A powerful explosion that ripped through a military explosives facility in Tennessee left no survivors, officials said.",
      "Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis confirmed 16 victims in the blast at a news conference on Saturday night, saying he has contacted all their family members after authorities discovered two of the initially missing people were found alive and not on site at the time of the incident.",
      "\"We've recovered no survivors,\" Davis said.",
      "Davis also said he did not yet have details on the identities of the victims as of Saturday night. The sheriff said earlier in the day that teams will enter to start conducting a rapid DNA search to identify the victims. There were no updates regarding injuries.",
      "The explosion took place at Accurate Energetic Systems, a military explosives plant, around 7:45 a.m. CT on Friday morning, according to Davis. The blast occurred in one of the eight buildings on the campus. Video from the scene showed damaged vehicles and charred debris scattered around the area.",
      "Earlier officials said 19 people were missing, but revised the number on Saturday, saying a person who was initially believed to be on site was located safely at home. Another person was also later found to not have been there at the time of the explosion,\u00a0Tennessee Emergency Management Agency\u00a0said.",
      "CBS affiliate WTVF-TV\u00a0in Nashville broadcast\u00a0video\u00a0of debris strewn about the site, with damaged vehicles in a parking lot.",
      "\"I'm not gonna lie to you,\" Davis said. \"This is probably one of the most devastating scenes that I've ever seen in my career.\"",
      "When asked to describe the affected building, Davis said: \"There's nothing to describe. It's gone.\"",
      "The Associated Press reported that the blast rattled homes miles away. Gentry Stover, a nearby resident, told AP that it woke him up.",
      "\"I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,\" he said in a phone interview. \"I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.\"",
      "What caused the explosion in Tennessee?",
      "The cause of the explosion was not yet known, and the investigation could take days, the sheriff said.",
      "Agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on site, Davis said. The Metro Nashville Police Department Bomb Squad also\u00a0said\u00a0it was responding to help process the scene. Davis said he expected crews to remain on the site for several days.",
      "Sources close to the investigation told CBS News on Saturday morning that investigators are back assessing the site of the blast. The area \"appears to be much more unstable than they thought,\" which is slowing down the process, and there are some small fires still smoldering around the building, sources said.",
      "Davis warned there could be continued small explosions at the site. Hickman County Advanced EMT David Stewart told The Associated Press that emergency crews initially couldn't enter the plant because of continuing detonations. Sources said several small \"controlled\" explosions will likely occur throughout the day.",
      "Agencies are using multiple methods to find and identify missing people; the FBI is using cell phone analysis to determine if the cell phone of someone who was reported missing was at or near the building at the time of the blast, while the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation will use rapid DNA testing to identify any victims that are found.",

      "AES has been awarded numerous military contracts primarily from the U.S. Army and Navy, according to public records reviewed by The Associated Press, and produced items including bulk explosives, small breaching charges and landmines. Officials at the Pentagon told AP they were aware of the explosion and were looking into the situation.",

    "summary": "With biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service furloughed because of the shutdown, a critical release of 400 captive-bred ferrets is at risk.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the communities across America impacted by the government shutdown, the population of endangered black-footed ferrets may be among the smallest and most vulnerable.",
      "This rare species, safeguarded under the protection of the Endangered Species Act, teeters on the brink of extinction, with about 300 existing in the wild.",
      "Now, with biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service furloughed because of the shutdown, a critical release of 400 captive-bred ferrets, designed to strengthen their wild populations, is in jeopardy.",
      "\"It just really makes us all very nervous,\" said Chamois Andersen, a senior leader at Defenders of Wildlife, a key non-profit partner on the federal agency's Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan. \"It's not something we can play around with, in terms of the timing and the funding. It's that endangered of a species.\"",
      "The government has been partially shut down for more than a week after a budget standoff in Congress over federal spending limits and extending expiring tax credits for health insurance.",
      "Andersen warns the next two months are critical for successfully introducing the captive ferrets. Fall provides the essential window for new ferrets to hone their hunting skills and begin mating before winter arrives. While many won't survive the cold, those that do will help stabilize the fragile, wild population.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service maintains a captive breeding program facility in Fort Collins, Colorado, where many of the ferrets await release. The facility is currently at full capacity, Andersen said.",
      "While it may be possible to keep the ferrets captive for another year, this uncharted territory risks halting any future breeding efforts until more space becomes available.",
      "\"That's the pipeline of animals going out to the wild,\" Andersen said. \"Anything that goes wrong with our system could be detrimental to the overall survival of the species.\"",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service referred CBS News to the Department of the Interior, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In prairie environments, such as the Badlands National Park in South Dakota, the black-footed ferret plays an indispensable role controlling the population of prairie dogs, which are known as a keystone species, essential to the health of the entire ecosystem. Without ferrets, unchecked prairie dog colonies can throw the entire system out of balance, impacting dozens of other species.",
      "\"I always attribute it to a rug and you have a frayed edge. If you start to pull on that piece of the rug it really unravels fast,\" Andersen said. \"We just hope there can be some resolve to the shutdown and people can return to their jobs and reintroductions can go on as scheduled.\""

      "To get medications through the kiosks, patients must first create an Amazon Pharmacy account, and schedule an appointment at any participating One Medical location. They can then ask their provider to send prescriptions to Amazon Pharmacy. The patient can pay for their medication in the Amazon app.",

      "EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER BADR ABDELATTY: Good to be with you, Margaret. Thank you so much for hosting me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump is headed to Egypt. I know he will be meeting with President al-Sisi tomorrow in Sharm El-Sheik to discuss this agreement about Gaza. But everything seems dependent on this hostage release and the conclusion of phase one, from what you know and hear from Hamas, will those hostages be released in the next 24 hours?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, we are confident that the first phase of the Trump peace plan will be implemented, will be honored by all parts concerns, and we are moving ahead. We are very hopeful that the first phase will be completed, in all honesty from the two parties, and we are in full contact with the Palestinians, with the Hamas, because it's all about, of course, releasing the hostages, and for Israel, releasing some of the Palestinian detainees, returning back some- I mean, the bodies of the those who passed away, but that will take time to collect the remains, of course, and to allow the flow of all humanitarian assistance to Gaza without impediments, In order to deal with current famine and starvation in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the vice president, who you just heard, said that President Trump has convinced a number of countries to provide ground troops to go into Gaza. Will Egypt be sending ground troops into Gaza?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, part of the deal is, of course, the issue of security arrangement, and we are working on different levels. First of all, there are some Palestinians in Gaza. They will be trained and be deployed in Gaza. We are in the process now, as we speak, providing training and coordination with Jordan to train up to 5000 Palestinians to be deployed in Gaza as well. Deployment of international force is on the table. We are supporting this idea, of course, and there are some countries, expressed their readiness to deploy forces to contribute with the forces on the ground. And we have to work now on going to the security council, of course, to endorse the proposal, as well as defining the main mandate of this troops on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader of Indonesia is already committed to 20,000 troops. Is Egypt going to commit troops? Do you have a number?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: We are, we are going to support and to commit troops within specific parameters. As I mentioned, we must have a mandate by the security council to endorse it, and of course, to you know, specify the mission of the of the troops on the ground, which will be peace keeping, and how to provide training to the Palestinian policeman in order to do the job, to- to have law enforcement on the ground. And, of course, to define the whole mission, and for how long, because it will be a transitional one, in order to help to the Palestinians to assume their four responsibilities, and to tell we have the realization of the Palestinian state on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are committing there to a Palestinian state. The President of the United States has given a more vague language, and when I pressed the Secretary of State on this point just last weekend, he said, This is far off in the future. How long do you think it's going to take before Palestinians are ruling Gaza and that we will see a state?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, what's very urgent now is, of course, ending this war on the innocent civilians in Gaza, provide as much as food and medicine to the people there. And then we have to move forward with regard to the early recovery and reconstructions of Gaza. And of course, talking about issues related to the governance and the security arrangement in Gaza. And of course, from our point of view, the end game, the final, comprehensive solution will be the realization of the Palestinian state. Because without that, we are confident through we have to draw lessons from the past, that without solving the Palestinian cause, which is the core of the conflict in the region, without respecting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to have their own statehood, you know, there is no peace and stability in the region. And the Trump peace plan, it refers to the statehood. And of course, 144 countries voted in favor of the two-state solution in New York recently. So this is a game on town.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, again, that's going to seemingly take a lot of time. I want to go back to the question of security, because it is essential for rebuilding, and share with you some of what the United Nations estimates here. The UN says 92% of housing units in Gaza are destroyed or damaged. Almost 92% of schools will require full reconstruction or rehab. 77% of the total road network has been damaged. 86% of total cropland is destroyed. How much is this going to cost, and where is this money coming from?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, first of all, we have full confidence on the leadership of President Trump and his vision for peace. He's the only person who is capable to end the war and to open a new chapter in the Middle East, a chapter of hope, of prosperity and peace for all peoples, including, of course, the Israeli people, the Palestinians, and all peoples in our region. So we are very appreciative, we are commanding his leadership, and we are in full support of his vision and his leadership. This is one. Number two, we are working very hard now with regard to convening an international conference in cooperation between Egypt and the United States, as well as with a lot of partners, including Germany, European Union, France, Italy, Spain, Qatar, Gulf Cooperation Council, Japan, everybody is standing ready to participate in this conference for The reconstruction and redevelopment of Gaza, it will be a merge between the Arab and Islamic plan for the reconstruction and the Trump peace plan. So I met today with the Deputy Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations, Tom Fletcher, and we are working very hard now for having a final assessment report. On the--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll look for that number to be released in the future, Mr. Foreign Minister, I have to leave it there for now. Good luck with the conference. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Good to have you here. You are a House lawmaker in town, but I want to talk to you about your intelligence portfolio. The Financial Times is reporting, right now, that the United States is helping Ukraine to target Russian oil installations. In other words, hitting Russia right in that pocketbook. What can you say in regard to how the Trump administration is changing its policy? Are they truly now standing up to Vladimir Putin?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Yeah, not really, right. We've heard now for months that we're two weeks away. I think that's the President's terminology, used several times now over many months from really cracking down on Russia. And of course, you know, there are bipartisan bills in the Congress right now which would impose very severe sanctions on the Russians that would do a lot to stop the export of their oil, which, of course, is the fuel that drives their war machine, the dollars that drive their war machine. Those have not been moved forward by the White House, so it's hard to say that President Trump is doing anything other than what he's done forever when he was president, which is trying to sort of have it, have it both ways. Now, I will say, and I can't get into particular attacks or particular authorities that the government has, but these attacks on the refineries have had the effect of reducing Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other stuff almost by 20%. That really, really hurts the Russians. And I will tell you, again, without being specific, that I wish the President would be much more aggressive with respect to turning off those taps and with respect to arming the Ukrainians, but he hasn't taken any meaningful step back- steps back from the Biden administration, so we've at least got that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not so much that he's doing more, it's that, perhaps, he's freeing up more to be done by the Ukrainian military? Not putting the same restrictions on them that he had been? Is that fair to say?",
      "REP. HIMES:\u00a0 Well, again, I don't want to get- I don't want to get specific with respect to authorities, but, you know, his rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric. There, I haven't noticed a dramatic change, pullback, if you will, from the Biden administration with respect to our assistance to the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you because Zelensky and Trump spoke twice in the past 48 hours, which is notable. Venezuela: There are close to- the numbers we've seen are like 6,000 or so service people in the Southern Command region of operations. There have been four US strikes on vessels. The US says 21 people killed. You have been asking for legal justification from the administration to explain their actions, and you did it along with the Head of Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security. Can you, in any way, compel more information sharing so the US knows what is being done?",
      "REP. HIMES: I mean one of the many troubling aspects about these lethal attacks in the Caribbean against supposedly drug-dealing boats. Now, we don't know that, because, unlike our counterterrorism programs, the Congress is not being told who were on these boats, how they were identified, what the intelligence was, totally different thing. Congress is being told nothing on this. And that's okay, apparently, with the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. It's not okay with me. I'm going to leave a little bit of a crack in the door here, because, again, the White House has not shared what they believe their legal justification is. They did put out a memo. I will tell you that, based on what I know now and the reading of that memo, these are illegal killings. They are illegal killings because the notion that the United States, and this is what the administration says is their justification, is involved in an armed conflict with any drug dealers- Venezuelan drug dealers is ludicrous. It wouldn't stand up in a single court of law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they've designated them as terrorists, therefore --",
      "REP. HIMES: Doesn't matter. There's lots of people who have been designated terrorists. That does not automatically give the authority to take lethal action. So, their legal justifications are laughable and what- and again, unless they want to share more than what they've shared with me, these are illegal killings. And what amazes me about that is that the President, of course, thanks to this very compliant Supreme Court, has been given absolute immunity. But what about the Secretary of Defense? What about the Deputy? What about everybody else in that chain of command, right on down to the guy who's pulling a trigger that results in the deaths of people without clear legal authority? What about them? Test me on this. It wouldn't surprise me if, in the next couple of years, there are presidential pardons offered to that entire chain of command, because it is not at all clear, well, it is getting increasingly clear, that these are that these are illegal killings. Setting aside the law for a second here. Margaret, you know, I don't know this because they're not telling Congress anything, but the press has all sorts of rumors that the first attack was on a boat that had turned around and was fleeing. Even if this were a legitimate military action, which it's not, because the Congress hasn't approved it, firing on a fleeing enemy would be a violation of the laws of armed conflict. My Republican friends are saying, but these are terrible people doing terrible things. Okay, I don't disagree with you on that, but are we now in the business of killing people who are doing bad things without authority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- are you saying that these were not lawful orders? That the military was- because what we constantly hear from our military leaders is, do not worry. Our United States military is going to be reliant on the Constitution and only carry out lawful orders. Are you saying that these members of the military who were the trigger pullers did something else?",
      "REP. HIMES: I am saying that, to all appearances, these are illegal killings. And you can get 1,000 different lawyers of both parties on this show to tell you that, at best, the legal authorities are questionable. So I am fascinated by why the chain of command is so confident that the lethal activities they're taking are legal. They don't look that way to me. And this is a big deal, right? I mean, I understand that right now we're in a very polarized environment, so it's going to be very hard for a Republican colleague of mine to make the statements that I have just made. But, the worm turns, Margaret. You know, in 1968 we prosecuted, convicted of murder a lieutenant, Lieutenant Cawley, because he and his unit killed, probably, hundreds of people in My Lai and Vietnam, and there were prosecutions after that. So I'm a little fascinated about why that chain of command is so comfortable undertaking killings just because the Trump administration says, oh, it's okay. Not an administration that is known for their adherence to the law or to the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is a huge topic, and I want to continue covering that with you. But, I need to ask you as well about the shutdown and the cost in your home state. We saw from just USAA, which is a lender and a bank, to many people who work for the federal government, they said that they've had to provide $150 million in no-interest loans to 45,000 people in just over 48 hours. That's a cash-crunch for a lot of people. What's happening in Connecticut?",
      "REP. HIMES: So, I mean, I will tell you a Connecticut story. The day after the shutdown went into effect, I went up to see the National Guard at Windsor Locks Airport. We were deploying 500 Connecticut National Guard members to the Middle East. These were 22, 23 year olds. None of them are wealthy. None of them are going to get paid on October 15th. And I heard the Vice President on your show say that this is about the Democrats. The American people understand that the Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, and they control the house. So when the Vice President United States is saying, this is all about Chuck Schumer, who the American people rejected in the last election, I think the American people see through that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House seems to be trying to take that issue off the table. The President posts on social media that they're going to repurpose funds somehow to pay the military, at least for this pay cycle. Is that sustainable? Is that legal?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, probably not. Again, we just had a little conversation about the White House's understanding of United States law, which is- which is- which is pretty tentative to say the best. The Speaker of the House, because I think to pay the military during a shutdown would require legislation. The Speaker of the House has taken that off the table. So, I mean, is Donald Trump going to say a bunch of stuff? Yes, he's going to say a bunch of stuff. But, I don't see anything moving. The house is, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the house is on vacation. So no, I don't think that that's very likely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Speaker says that if the government wasn't shut down, the military be getting a pay if Democrats voted for the short term funding bill. But, no one's working right now, as you just said. We'll have to continue to track this. Thank you, Congressman Himes. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now, here in studio, by Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Thank you for being with us.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just on this topic, I know you have a lot of differences with the President, but on this, is this a clear win?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, it's really important that we have a cease fire. It's important that these hostages are coming home, and I congratulate the negotiators on getting this done. There's, there's no politics about this moment, as you're going to see some very tearful reunions tomorrow, hopefully as these hostages are released. But you watch those devastating images of what Gaza looks like today, and it's both heartbreaking and infuriating that this deal has been on the table for over a year. And it's been Benjamin Netanyahu, because of his political considerations domestically, trying to protect himself, has frustrated the ability to find peace and to get the hostages home far before today. So again, this will be a good week, but as you have reported, there are big issues to come. Israel is not fully pulling out of Gaza. There is no clear path forward on what the security and governance force is going to look like inside that country. There is certainly a risk of hostilities beginning again if we don't build on this first phase and come to some decisions about what Gaza looks like heading into next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden wasn't willing to put this kind of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump has. Your point is that's got to be sustained pressure to see this all the way through. My understanding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Yeah. I mean, listen, I think the barrier here has been Netanyahu, and Netanyahu is only going to move if he thinks that his relationship with the United States is at risk. And so, clearly, the pressure is going to have to continue to be strong and constant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now let me ask you about the other diplomacy that needs to happen just up the street frankly. You have called on Democrats to stiffen their spines to stand up to the president of the United States. At what point, though, does this pain become too much in terms of the cost of the shutdown. And when are Democrats going to show some flexibility on this?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, I listened to the Vice President, and he's just not living in reality. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --\u00a0 What do you mean? --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- The fact is, well, because there's no negotiations happening right now because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations. They are boycotting negotiations to reopen the government because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy. Their only priority is protecting the billionaire class and the corporate class. The other reason the House of Representatives isn't in town right now trying to reopen the government, because they are about to have enough votes to pass a resolution mandating the release of the Epstein files. So JD Vance and Donald Trump's number one priority is protecting billionaires, protecting corporations and raising premiums, raising health care costs by 75% on American citizens. So yes, I think that Democrats should say if you want our votes for a budget, it can't be a corrupt budget. It can't be a budget that is going to devastate the lives of middle class families in this country in order to protect and reward billionaires. That's a pretty reasonable request.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the premiums that will increase an average of about $1,000, I believe, for those who are using some of these --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- That's the average, but in Connecticut, some families will see a $25,000 increase in premiums. And again, in order to afford a $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in this country. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because also it wasn't dealt with earlier when Democrats were in leadership here. But you did hear the Vice President say, when it came to health care, the administration is open to a discussion, we want to lower insurance premiums. That was a quote there. Did you hear any chance at an opening?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: I mean, there are no negotiations happening, in large part because the House of Representatives isn't even here. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- They've been on an unprecedented five week recess because they do not want to risk their billionaire tax cut and they also don't want to talk about the president's lawlessness. I mean, that's the other thing that we have to talk about in this budget. If we're going to fund this administration, we need to fund an administration that is paying attention to the law. I would be a sucker, Margaret, to vote for a budget that allows the president to then go and spend money only in states that are run by Republicans and spend no money in states that are run by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is just the seven week deal that we're talking about at this point, the short term funding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- Correct, the long term budget that we pass ultimately has to require that the president not engage in mass scale corruption. But a short term agreement, certainly is not going to fix all of the problems that exist right now in the way the President is running the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have been critical in the past of the tactic of choosing to shut down the government. You were in 2018, you were back in 2013 when it was a discussion over health care. This is what you said in 2018.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SEN. MURPHY: The future of the American health care system was a legitimate public policy issue, as is the security of our borders, but we shouldn't be having the discussion amidst a government shutdown, trying to use our nation's security and all of these federal workers and the work that they do as hostages.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't you doing today exactly what you were criticizing then?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, that was a fight over, sort of, the long term structure of the American health care system. This is an emergency. In about a month, premiums are going to go up by people by 75% and we have to make a decision whether this budget is going to allow for that to happen or to stop it. What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency. So we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do not--",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Those are urgent matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do not trust that if you vote to open the government and then have a separate conversation about health care, that there will be any follow through?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Absolutely not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that is what the vice president was arguing here, that it's like Democrats aren't even saying what it is they want to negotiate over.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, you cannot trust this administration. And I think it's important to remember that we didn't have a shutdown when Joe Biden was president, and the reason is because they didn't play the kind of games that Republicans are playing. Joe Biden and Democrats, when we were in charge of the Senate, negotiated with Republicans and avoided shutdowns. This shutdown is happening because Republicans are desperate to protect their billionaire tax cut. And all we are asking- we're not asking to fix the entire American health care system. We're simply saying, don't make things worse by raising premiums by people, in some cases, by $25,000 a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Minority Leader gave an interview to Punchbowl this week. I mean, there is just also the bare bones politics of this. And in that interview, he said, every day this goes on, every day gets better for us. The Speaker of the House said that was this callous statement.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, they're- they're sort of desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying. Listen, our priority is the American people. And yes, it is true, as every day--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been critical of Schumer in the past, back in March, you were saying, we've got to stand up and do something. Is this about the tactic of just saying, hey, we're standing up?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No. As every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are breaking with JD Vance and President Trump and saying, yes, we should be willing to sit down and talk about the health care crisis that is about to visit this country. There are more Republicans that are breaking with the president's regime of censorship. So as every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are willing to stand up and protect the American people, to try to stop the President's destruction of democracy, and hopefully at some point, there will be enough Republicans to join us and try to protect people's pocketbooks, which are about to be destroyed, their economic livelihoods are about to be destroyed, by these enormous increases in health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but in the meantime, there's also the not- not getting a paycheck problem for some of these people.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Where's the House of Representatives, Margaret? They're on vacation. The only way you can solve a shutdown is to have two parties that are in Washington negotiating. This is pretty simple. Republicans are boycotting negotiations. They're in the witness protection program all over the country, refusing to even show up for work. If they're serious about sitting down and reopening the government, they would be in Washington rather than spread out all over the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Appreciate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin today with Vice President JD Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati, this morning. Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72 hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the President is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person. It's a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. The President of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel- which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive. It was a very tall task. He pursued a very non traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40 year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And of course, the President was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it. But I think that because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done. We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular, of this deal. Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 US troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here? And more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret. It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down. I know the President is very committed to doing that, but you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about, we see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace. One of the under reported elements of this deal Margaret is that the President convinced the entire Muslim world really both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety. And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground, we're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security. You said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that quote, \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\" Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been okay with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the President didn't agree with.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, look, as the President said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid. That's a difficult balance to strike, but I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded. They were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel. This is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world. It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government. There were more than 4,000 layoff notices called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the President described this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this so we'll get little taste of their own medicine.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on Margaret is ensuring essential services remain open, and obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low income women and children get the food services that they need. We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused, and unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about. We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer, the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs, that's why it's a little different this time, and specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector. CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case, but some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, so- so two- two responses to that, Margaret. First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well. But the second point, Margaret, is the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government. We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and- and to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats, have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos. So you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the President talking about that. That- that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does, and in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential- essential services stay on. But unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the- the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us. That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Anti Deficiency Act?",
      "JD VANCE: Well, we are confident. Margaret, of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret? All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff \u2013 we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation, because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government. If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the President of the United States. Only the five people, including the President, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the President insist that lawmakers come back to Washington sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving this shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate, and again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a deal maker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a deal making. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage taking. Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans. Of course, we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the President of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops. That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans, we want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats: we are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just a quick follow there. Though, what is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them. We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually Margaret, that's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0All right, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

    "story": [
      "At a massive military parade attended by foreign leaders, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rolled out his nuclear-armed military's most powerful weapons, including a new intercontinental ballistic missile he may be preparing to test in coming weeks.",
      "The parade, which began in the rain Friday night at Pyongyang's main square and marked the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party, highlighted Kim's growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build an arsenal that could target the continental United States and his rivals in Asia.",
      "North Korean state media said Saturday that the parade featured a new, yet-to-be-tested ICBM called the Hwasong-20, which it described as the country's \"most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.\"",
      "Joined by high-level Chinese, Vietnamese and Russian officials at a podium, Kim said in a speech that his military \"should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats,\" but made no direct mention of the United States or South Korea.",
      "He also praised the thousands of North Korean soldiers he sent to Russia to join its war against Ukraine, saying they displayed \"heroic fighting spirit\" and \"ideological and spiritual perfection\" in a battle for \"international justice and genuine peace.\"",
      "Edited footage from North Korean state television showed what appeared to be tens of thousands of spectators packed into the brightly lit square, cheering and waving the national flag as columns of goose-stepping soldiers and missile-mounted vehicles rolled through the rain-soaked streets. The soldiers included troops Kim had sent to Russia, who marched under North Korean and Russian flags as state media hailed them as \"invincible\" warriors.",
      "North Korea, in recent years, has flight-tested a variety of ICBMs that could potentially reach the U.S. mainland, including missiles with built-in solid propellants that are easier to move and conceal and can be prepared for launch more quickly than the North's previous liquid-fueled missiles.",
      "The parade saw the debut of the massive Hwasong-20, with at least three of them wheeled out on 11-axle launcher trucks.",
      "The new missile's existence was first revealed in recent weeks as North Korea tested a new solid-fuel rocket engine that it said was intended for future ICBMs. State media said the engine, built with carbon fiber, is more powerful than past models.",
      "Kim has called for the development of multi-warhead systems that would improve the chances of penetrating missile defenses, and some experts say the\u00a0Hwasong-20\u00a0could be designed for that purpose.",
      "Other weapons on display included shorter-range ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles, which the North previously described as capable of delivering nuclear strikes against targets in South Korea. The parade also featured Kim's newest tanks, artillery systems and drones, which have been a key focus of his efforts to\u00a0expand\u00a0his conventional military capabilities after he spent much of his early rule concentrating on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.",
      "Kim this week hosted a rare group of high-level foreign officials sent to Pyongyang to attend the anniversary celebrations, including Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of Moscow's Security Council, and Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary To Lam.",
      "During the parade, Kim took the central spot at the podium, flanked by Li to his right and Lam to his left, while Medvedev stood next to Lam.",
      "The high-level visits highlight Kim's increasingly assertive foreign policy as he seeks to break out of isolation and establish a larger role for North Korea in a united front against the U.S.-led West. North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president's first term. In a recent speech, Kim urged Washington to drop its demand for the North to surrender its nukes as a precondition for resuming diplomacy.",
      "Kim also visited China last month and shared center stage with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a massive military parade.",
      "Kim on Friday separately met with Medvedev to discuss developing the \"comprehensive strategic partnership and alliance\" with Russia, the official Korean Central News Agency said. Medvedev praised the \"bravery and self-sacrificing spirit\" of North Korean soldiers who fought alongside Russian forces to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk border region, and called for expanded exchanges and cooperation between the two governments. Kim had also met Li and Lam on Thursday for talks on strengthening ties."

Afterward, they brought the document to other Arab leaders to get feedback.",
      "The senior official said negotiators met with Turkey and Egypt, in addition to Qatar. On Tuesday, Sept. 23, during his day at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump presented the 20-point plan to a roundtable of Arab leaders, which elicited \"a lot of feedback.\"",

      "Monday, Sept. 29: Netanyahu's apology to Qatar",
      "Mr. Trump announced the 20-point proposal during a meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. That day, the president, Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister spoke on a phone call, and Netanyahu apologized for Israel's strikes on Doha, expressing \"his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,\" according to a White House readout of the call.",
      "The Israeli strike had caused \"a lot of angst within the Arab world\" and there was \"deep mistrust between the parties,\" a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, \"as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do.\"",
      "\"That got us some leverage,\" the official added.",
      "Around this time, an official said the U.S. began to detect Hamas \"had had enough.\"",
      "\"Every family in Gaza has been affected by this,\" the official said. \"You read some of the public opinion of polls \u2014 the Gazans do not just blame Israel for this conflict. They, in large part, were blaming Hamas for it. We began to sense that turn in leverage.\"",
      "Within days, there would be a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, with the Turkish and Egyptian intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister.",
      "Friday, Oct. 3: in Miami, Kushner, Witkoff work on hostage releases",

      "Kushner and Witkoff arrived in Sharm El Sheikh at 6:30 a.m. local time and \"immediately went to work,\" according to one senior U.S. official. They spent \"a lot of time\" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.",
      "During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.",
      "Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an \"almost permanent ceasefire\" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.",
      "Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff.",
      "\"His message was, 'First, get it done,'\" a U.S. official said. He also reiterated that he stood behind every aspect of his 20-point plan.",
      "\"POTUS wanted people on both sides to understand that he was going to enforce good conduct here, and that was a critical and overarching message that we were there to talk about,\" this official said.",

      "Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8, Wednesday evening: \"Serious breakthroughs\"",
      "\"We began to have some very, very serious breakthroughs with regard to all of these issues,\" the U.S. official said, prompting another meeting Wednesday night with Kushner, Witkoff and Middle East officials.",
      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",

      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Witkoff and Kushner then traveled to Cairo, and met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to tell him he was needed for the implementation phase. After the El-Sisi meeting, Witkoff and Kushner flew to Tel Aviv.",
      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",
      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/threatened-species-arctic-seals-majority-bird-species-iucn-red-list/",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 07:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",
      "Three Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species."

      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Indirect peace talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending the war in Gaza and freeing the remaining Israeli hostages resumed Wednesday in Egypt. President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were expected to arrive in Egypt on Wednesday to join the conversations, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Israeli officials believe 48 of those people remain captive, though only 20 are believed to still be alive.",
      "Since that day, the Gaza Strip's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says Israel's retaliatory war has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians. Israel disputes that figure but provides no estimate of its own, and the United Nations considers the health ministry's count the most reliable information available, as Israel has barred foreign journalists from operating independently in Gaza.",
      "Ricardo Pires, a spokesman for the United Nations children's charity UNICEF, said this week that what he calls Israel's \"disproportionate response\" in Gaza has killed or maimed at least 61,000 children since the war started.",
      "UNICEF and the global charity Save the Children, which cited data compiled by the Hamas-run Gaza Government Media Office, say that on average, a child dies every hour in Gaza \u2014 or \"a classroom of children\" per day, as UNICEF put it.",
      "Since the war started, Save the Children says at least 20,000 kids have been killed in total \u2013 amounting to nearly a third of all Palestinians believed to have died in the war.",
      "UNICEF spokesman James Elder, told CBS News that when he visited one of Gaza's beleaguered hospitals this week, \"the first thing I saw was four children who had all been shot by quadcopters [military drones], then I went into a hallway and it was wall-to-wall children across all the corridors.\"",
      "\"There was a boy bleeding out on the floor who had apparently been there for five hours, then he was put on a stretcher only for another child to be put in his place,\" Elder told CBS News. \"Then I watched a little girl die. That's half an hour here in Gaza.\"",
      "The staggering death toll does not reflect the thousands more children who have been maimed and injured, or those who have lost one or both parents during the war.",
      "At a makeshift camp for Palestinian orphans in the southern city of Khan Younis, CBS News' team in Gaza saw some of the young faces behind the grim statistics.",
      "\"I wish the war were just a dream I'd wake up from and see my parents next to me,\" said 14-year-old Deena Al-Za'arab, who lost both of her parents.",
      "\"I have to keep it together for the sake of my siblings,\" she added, \"because now I must raise them.\"",
      "Many of the children at the camp now spend their days doing the work of adults.",
      "Arat Awqal, who is just 10, promised her father she'd be a doctor before he died, but she now focuses on taking care of her younger sister.",
      "\"I just want to go back to how it used to be,\" she told CBS News. \"Whenever we heard the sound of missiles my father would hold us, but now he's gone, and we are always scared.\"",
      "UNICEF says one in five children in Gaza is acutely malnourished, and Elder stressed that the trauma being inflicted on the youngest is not just physical.",
      "\"The kids not only lost loved ones \u2014 it's not just about just having your mother killed, it's about watching your mother die, then add that level of trauma to being displaced \u2014 and we talk of displacement, it sounds like a neutral or abstract term. It's not. It's violent. It's repetitious, and it also increases trauma.\"",
      "The U.N. estimates that about 90% of Gaza's population, some 1.9 million people, have been forcibly displaced during the war, many of them multiple times as the focus of Israel's military operations has shifted. Most recently, the Israel Defense Forces ordered everyone to leave Gaza City, the enclave's biggest population center, and to move further south, to areas such as Khan Younis.",
      "It's led to another mass exodus, which aid workers say has increased the suffering in the region and made it harder to help those showing up, often with nothing.",
      "\"There have been several hundred thousands of people who have moved from the north recently, in the last few weeks,\" Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CBS News' Haley Ott on Wednesday.",
      "\"The situation was already very crowded,\" she said, speaking on the phone from central Gaza. \"They are now even more so. You can see a lot of people living on the side of the road, pitching tents on the sides of the roads \u2026 There are many people who fled on foot and, of course, were not able to bring anything with them, and this creates extremely difficult conditions in terms of hygiene, sanitation and these kinds of things.\"",
      "At the camp for the orphans \u2014 all of them among the displaced \u2014 12-year-old Gazal Basam told CBS News she felt \"such pain in my heart after losing my dad.\"",

    "story": [
      "Panelists Brent Sadler and Derek Maltz weigh in on the Pentagon taking aim at narcoterrorists near Venezuela on \u2018America Reports.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented war against cartels and has threatened narco-terrorists, saying he will \"blow you out of existence\" as his administration seeks to curb the influx of drugs into the U.S.",
      "The White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug smugglers \u2014 on top of conducting four fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September.",
      "The Department of War recently announced a new counter-narcotics Joint Task Force in the Southern Command area of responsibility, according to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.",
      "The aim of the task force is to \"crush the cartels, stop the poison, and keep America safe,\" Hegseth wrote on X Friday. \"The message is clear: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold.\"",
      "HOW TRUMP\u2019S STRIKES AGAINST ALLEGED NARCO-TERRORISTS ARE RESHAPING THE CARTEL BATTLEFIELD: 'ONE-WAY TICKET'",
      "These recent developments suggest that Trump is eyeing targets within Venezuela, not just those within international waters, according to Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council international affairs think tank.",
      "\"This is a sign that President Trump is taking the US war on drugs in Latin America to the next level,\" Ramsey said in a Monday email to Fox News Digital. \"By involving the military, the president is going after drug cartels in a way that no previous US administration has dared to so far. I think it is likely that we will see the Pentagon evaluate targets inside Venezuela.\"",
      "President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he ordered a lethal strike on a vessel linked to a designated terrorist organization operating in the U.S. Southern Command\u2019s area of responsibility Sept. 19, 2025.\u00a0 (@realDonaldTrump via Truth Social)",
      "Additional strikes could target more drug shipments or drug flights, which often take off from covert airfields near the Colombian border, Ramsey said.",
      "\"It's a bad time to be posted in a guerrilla camp on the Colombian border or operating a Tren de Aragua safe house along the Caribbean trafficking route,\" Ramsey said.",
      "Even so, Ramsey said it would be challenging to strike within Venezuela\u2019s territory. Doing so would require the U.S. to dismantle Venezuela\u2019s air defense system, which would escalate hostilities by openly engaging with Venezuela\u2019s military, he said.",
      "That\u2019s a departure from the current approach, in which the U.S. has intentionally avoided targeting Venezuelan military assets, Ramsey said.",
      "\"When two Venezuelan F-16s flew over a US destroyer last month, the fact that those planes weren't blown out of the sky suggests that the US is not interested in a shooting war with Venezuela's military,\" Ramsey said.",
      "Trump himself has not ruled out conducting strikes within Venezuela though, and signaled such strikes could happen when he told military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, Sept. 30 that his administration would \"look very seriously at cartels coming by land.\"",

      "So far, the Trump administration has utilized maritime forces to address drug threats, and has beefed up naval assets in the Caribbean in recent months. For example, Trump approved sending several U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers to bolster the administration\u2019s counter-narcotics efforts in the region starting in August.",
      "\"I expect these deployments to continue for months or more than a year, with new ships rotating in to replace those that need to return home for maintenance or crew rest,\" Bryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute think tank\u2019s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology, told Fox News Digital in September.",
      "Nathan Jones, a nonresident scholar in drug policy and Mexico studies at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, predicted the strikes are unlikely to impact the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. That\u2019s because fentanyl precursors originate in China, and are then produced in labs in Mexico before they head north without a pathway into the Caribbean.",
      "\"I wouldn't expect your drug flow to be affected because of these strikes,\" Jones told Fox News Digital Tuesday. \"This could, though, leave transnational criminal organizations running a little scared in terms of what the administration is going to do.\"",
      "Still, Jones said that he predicted drug flow routes would adapt and that land or aerial drug routes would take precedence over sea routes in the Caribbean.",
      "The strikes have prompted members of Congress to question their legality and senators Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September that would block U.S. forces from engaging in \"hostilities\" against certain non-state organizations.",

      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., speaks at a press conference in April 2025 in Washington.\u00a0 (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)",
      "\"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way,\" Schiff told reporters Wednesday. \"I feel it is plainly unconstitutional. The fact that the administration claims to have a list and has put organizations on a list does not somehow empower the administration to usurp Congress's power of declaring war or refusing to declare war or refusing to authorize the use of force.\"",
      "However, the measure failed in the Senate by a 51\u201348 margin Wednesday. Even so, the measure attracted support from Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution.",

      "\"I\u2019ve always been a proponent of smooth jazz,\" she quipped.",
      "Certain portions of the day went far less smoothly. Xinis upbraided the Trump administration for its failure to produce a witness for the court to testify about what steps it had taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's deportation to a third country, describing the official who appeared on the stand as a witness \"who knows less than nothing\" about the case, and the countries they are considering removing him to.",

      "Xinis had ordered the evidentiary hearing Monday, with the stated goal of evaluating a request from Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers, that he be released from immigration detention pending further action in his case, and to question a Trump administration official with \"first-hand\" knowledge of the government's efforts to facilitate his deportation to the third country of Eswatini, where Trump officials said they intend to send him.",
      "Still, the hearing was much more notable for what it failed to produce than what it did. Judge Xinis struggled to clarify seemingly contradictory statements and testimony from Trump officials, including what countries agreed or did not agree to accept Abrego Garcia, and when.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration acknowledged to Xinis that they had previously identified three African countries \u2014 Uganda, Ghana, and Eswatini\u2014 as suitable third country locations to deport Abrego Garcia, pending dissolution of her emergency order keeping him in the U.S.",
      "But they mistakenly represented the positions of both Ghana and Eswatini. As of this writing, none of the three governments mentioned agreed to accept Abrego Garcia.",
      "Xinis honed in on this detail Friday evening.",
      "\"Now that we know Costa Rica is on the table, have there been any conversations about removing him [there]?\" she asked Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign, who said that there had not been.",
      "\"Why not?\" Xinis pressed. \"You don\u2019t want him in the country \u2014 you've said that,\" she said, referring more broadly to the views of the the Trump administration. \u00a0\"You have a country that will take him. You have a plaintiff who says \u2018I\u2019ll go there.'\"",

They connect their computer to Wi-Fi, type in a password and get on with their day. But if you have ever wondered whether plugging in an Ethernet cable is safer than sticking to wireless, you are asking the right question. The way you connect can have real consequences for your privacy and security. Recently, Kathleen reached out to me with the same doubt.",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",

      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections.

    "story": [
      "Skydweller CEO Robert Miller discusses his company's solar-powered drone that can fly for days on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Shoplifting has long been a challenge for retailers, but a U.S. company now believes that flying drones could help combat the issue. Flock Safety, best known for its law enforcement camera systems, is promoting its new Flock Aerodome Drone as an Automated Security system to the private sector. The idea is simple: if a theft occurs, a drone launches, follows the suspect, and streams live video back to security teams or even police. With theft rates reportedly climbing 93% in 2024, the push for high-tech security has never been stronger.",

      "An example of a Flock Safety drone, ready to follow theft suspects within seconds (Flock Safety)",
      "How the drones would work",
      "Instead of dispatching a guard, Flock's drones could launch within seconds after motion is detected. Equipped with HD and thermal cameras, the drones can zoom in, track suspects, and relay real-time visuals.",
      "The company says the system:",

      "TEXAS COMPANY CREATES DRONES TO CONFRONT SCHOOL SHOOTERS IN SECONDS",
      "Why retailers may be interested",
      "Organized retail crime is a growing problem. Retailers have been reporting higher losses, tighter budgets, and fewer staff members available. Flock Safety argues its drone system can act as a deterrent simply by being visible, making criminals think twice before targeting a store. Beyond retail, the company is also pitching its drones to operators of hospitals, warehouse sites, and energy facilities that require large-scale surveillance.",
      "Due to the drones' helpful technologies, retailers may soon rely on them as a visible deterrent against organized theft. (Flock Safety)",
      "HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND",
      "What this means for you",
      "For shoppers, this could mean visiting stores where drones are part of the security landscape. You might notice them overhead at malls or parking lots, watching for unusual activity. While some may view this as an added safety measure, others may worry about increased surveillance and loss of privacy. For retailers, drones could help protect profits, staff, and customers without the rising costs of hiring additional guards. But whether customers welcome drones buzzing around remains to be seen.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology is quickly reshaping how companies approach security, and drones may soon play a bigger role in everyday shopping environments. With faster response times, broader coverage, and lower staffing costs, the idea has clear appeal for retailers. At the same time, questions about privacy and public acceptance will influence the extent to which this technology is adopted.",

      "Over the past few years, data breaches targeting schools, healthcare providers, and childcare services have been making headlines, exposing sensitive personal information and leaving families vulnerable. Now, a new breach has come to light that targets a nursery chain. Kido, which operates in the U.S., U.K., China and India, has reportedly had sensitive data stolen from thousands of children. Names, photos, addresses, birthdates, parental details and even safeguarding notes and medical records were allegedly accessed by a hacker group called Radiant.",

      "The incident highlights how stolen data threatens not just privacy but also long-term child safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about nursery breach",
      "According to reports, the hacker group Radiant claims to have stolen data related to around 8,000 children. To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid. In addition to targeting the nursery chain directly, Radiant reportedly called some of the children's parents, pressuring them to push Kido into paying the ransom.",
      "FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation. This defense is misleading, as such testing requires explicit permission from the organization being targeted or participation in an official bug bounty program. Without that consent, these actions are illegal and deeply unethical.",
      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so disturbing?",
      "The Kido breach is alarming for multiple reasons. First, it involves children's data, which is particularly sensitive and legally protected in most countries. Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft. It can impact children's safety, family privacy and long-term well-being. With attackers leveraging both the stolen data and psychological pressure on parents, the threat is particularly potent and long-lasting.",

      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",

Still, she worries that turning Google Docs into chat rooms could open the door to bullying or cheating. Parents are also weighing in.

While some of these workarounds seem harmless, they also carry risks, from distractions that take focus away from learning to new opportunities for bullying or even cheating.

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson shares practical ways to avoid falling victim to AI-generated phishing scams and discusses a report that North Korean agents are posing as I.T. workers to funnel money into the country's nuclear program.",
      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",
      "\"I received a spam email from my employer's email. It had a document attached to it. I tried to open it and could not. I contacted my employer and they told me they hadn't sent me anything. I changed my password and ran a virus scan. I also have been checking on the dark web for anything coming up on me. So far everything is okay. I did sign up for antivirus software based on your recommendation and we are signed up for identity theft protection. Is there anything else I should do?\"",
      "Incidents like this are more common than many realize, Krysti. And while it sounds like you took the right first steps by changing your password, scanning for malware and monitoring for identity misuse, there are a few additional precautions worth taking.

      "Phishing emails often look like they come from someone you know, making them harder to spot. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",
      "Once you interact with these emails, the risks multiply. Opening a malicious attachment could install spyware or ransomware. Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",

      "What to do immediately after a close call",
      "Changing your password or running a malware scan is often not enough to stop attackers. It's worth going a little further to make sure nothing slipped through. Start by checking your login history to see if there are any unauthorized sign-ins on your email or work accounts.",
      "Most platforms allow you to review recent activity, including device type and location, and if anything looks suspicious, sign out of all sessions immediately and change your password again. Next, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your email and any other critical accounts. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they won't be able to gain access without the second verification step.",
      "It's also important to alert your IT team, especially if the email appears to come from your employer's address. This could mean the company's email system has been compromised, and notifying them will allow them to investigate and secure other accounts if necessary. Finally, make sure all your software is up to date. Malware often exploits vulnerabilities in outdated systems, so regularly updating your operating system, antivirus and productivity tools adds another layer of protection against future attacks.",

      "7 ways to check if your device or data is compromised",
      "Some cyber threats don't reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they've stolen. The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them. Reducing this digital footprint not only makes it harder for attackers to build profiles on you but also limits how easily phishing attempts can be tailored to your life.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Your information could already be circulating in breach dumps and underground markets without you realizing it. Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details. If they find a match, they alert you so you can act quickly: change passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes with the credit bureaus.",
      "Your information might already be circulating in dark web marketplaces without you realizing it. Identity theft protection services can help by continuously scanning those underground sites for your email, passwords or other sensitive details. If your data does show up, these services notify you right away so you can reset credentials, freeze accounts or take other protective actions before the information is misused.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if you never shared payment details, attackers may attempt account takeovers or fraudulent transactions using any information they have. Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Modern cyber threats go beyond viruses. A strong antivirus solution now acts as a full security layer, blocking phishing websites, detecting malicious scripts and stopping suspicious activity before it can compromise your device. If you've interacted with a suspicious attachment or link, a reputable antivirus tool can catch malware that might still be hiding in the background.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

    "story": [
      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "When someone stops breathing, the clock starts ticking. First responders often need to get air into the lungs fast, and one of the most reliable ways is to slide a tube into the windpipe. This process, called intubation, keeps the airway open so that oxygen can flow again.",
      "Here's the catch: intubation is incredibly hard. Even trained doctors can struggle, and every extra second puts the patient at greater risk. Now, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have designed a soft robotic device that could change how first responders handle these emergencies. It helps guide the breathing tube into place quickly, safely, and with far less training than traditional methods.",

      "Why breathing tubes are so tough to place",
      "Our bodies are built to keep food and foreign objects out of the lungs. A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",
      "DANGEROUS HEART CONDITIONS DETECTED IN SECONDS WITH AI STETHOSCOPE",
      "Even trained doctors can struggle with intubation. (Universal Images Group/Getty Images)",
      "How the soft robot works",
      "The new system, called the soft robotic intubation system (SRIS), takes a gentler approach. First, a curved guide sits at the back of the throat. Then a soft inflatable tube slowly unrolls from the inside out as it advances. Instead of being forced in, it naturally follows the right path into the windpipe. This reduces friction, lowers the risk of injury and adapts to different body shapes automatically.\u00a0\"This growing paradigm naturally accounts for minor variations in anatomy,\" said lead author David Haggerty, a recent UCSB Ph.D. graduate.",
      "What the tests show",
      "The results are eye-opening:",
      "Experts had a 100% success rate.Paramedics and EMTs reached a 96% success rate with just five minutes of training.Non-experts placed the tube in an average of 21 seconds, less than half the time needed with advanced video laryngoscopes.",

      "The fake fee scam: Just like the\u00a0DMV notice scam that claims the recipient has unpaid toll fees, scammers use probate data to pose as attorneys or court officials, claiming heirs owe fees to release inheritance funds.

      "Cyberguy lays out ways to avoid inheritance scams. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "The \"advanced fee\" gift: Anyone who promises to expedite probate proceedings or secure larger inheritances for an upfront fee is probably in it to win it (for themselves). Some cases even involve disgruntled family members acting out of greed. These are not your run-of-the-mill remote scammers from a foreign country; these can be local \"facilitators\" who have no actual authority and simply pocket the money. If someone claims you have an inheritance coming, but they need \"a fee to unlock it\" or they promise to \"handle your probate case\" for a small upfront fee, you guessed it \u2014 nothing ever comes from it.",
      "Why probate scams work",
      "Grief is a beacon for fraudsters. With grief comes diminished critical thinking from even the hardiest of privacy diehards. Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines. When something demands immediate action, victims feel compelled to respond before verifying claims or consulting attorneys, which is exactly what fraudsters count on.",

      "Never send money or give information to an unsolicited contact about an estate. If someone claims you owe fees or have obligations, independently verify their identity or company. Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",
      "In most jurisdictions, you can't prevent a probate filing from going public. But you can minimize additional data exposure by not sharing anything on social media and limiting contact to only key parties that you trust with financial information.",

You can't prevent much of this information from entering the public record, but you can control how you respond, and how much personal data is out there. Any probate topics should come through official court channels, and never an unsolicited phone call, email or text message. When in doubt, verify with your probate court, and always consult your estate attorney.

The announcement comes at a time when large-scale attacks on cloud CRM systems have already shaken tech and retail sectors alike, with Salesforce clients such as Google, Allianz and Dior reporting similar intrusions.

Today, it ranks among the world's largest automakers by revenue and is fifth in volume globally. The company houses 14 well-known brands, including Jeep and Dodge, as well as Peugeot, Maserati and Vauxhall, and operates manufacturing infrastructure across more than 130 countries. That global scale naturally makes it a tempting target for cyber adversaries.",
      "Stellantis confirmed hackers stole customer contact details in a recent breach. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "In its public statement, Stellantis clarified that only contact information was taken. Since the compromised third-party platform does not host financial or deeply sensitive personal data, Stellantis asserts that Social Security numbers, payment details and health records were out of reach of the attackers. In response, the company activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, contained the breach, notified authorities and began alerting affected customers. It also issued warnings about phishing and urged customers not to click suspicious links.",

      "ShinyHunters claims to have stolen over 18 million records from Stellantis' Salesforce instance, which includes names and contact details, according to Bleeping Computer. These attacks form part of a broader campaign aimed at Salesforce customers.

      "Attackers often combine exposed contact information with other data to build complete identity profiles. Identity theft protection services monitor for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized credit applications or changes to official records, and alert you early so you can act before serious damage occurs.

The same patterns seen in attacks on Google, LVMH and others have now reached the auto industry in a serious way. As Stellantis confronts the fallout, the broader lesson is clear. Organizations must treat the surfaces exposed by their service providers and SaaS integrations with as much vigilance as their own core systems.",

      "The ID program, dubbed \"Brit Card\" and announced last week by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is set to be rolled out by August 2029 in an attempt by the Labour government to crack down on illegal immigration as it would bar anyone who doesn\u2019t have a digital ID from working in the U.K.",

      "But according to one security expert, digital ID is actually not nearly as concerning as most opponents of the system believe it to be.",
      "\"When the government issues a digital ID, they're issuing it to the individual. That means, just like your paper ID sits in your physical wallet, your digital ID sits in your digital wallet, it's not stored at a central location,\" Eric Starr, founder and CEO of\u00a0Ultrapass Identity Corp, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"When you pass your digital ID to a relying party, they don't ping a central database,\" he continued. \"They look at the digital ID you've presented, and through cryptography, can determine the authenticity of the digital document.\"",

      "Starr, whose company works with governments around the world to provide decentralized digital ID options, said the controversy around digital ID comes down to poor conception and a lack of understanding.",
      "The tech guru said he believes the U.K. went about its rollout of a digital ID the wrong way by making it mandatory and releasing few details on the system itself.",
      "Starr argued that governments have the right to know who its citizens are and nations, including the U.S., already have systems in place that keep track of its people, including by issuing social security numbers \u2013 a system that the U.S. has relied on since 1936.",
      "When pressed about concerns relating to a government\u2019s ability to enforce mass surveillance through the ease that the technology could offer, even if that is not the original intent, Starr said it comes down to establishing those protections for personal privacy from the get-go.",

      "\"We care deeply about personal freedom in ways that other countries don't think about it, and generally speaking, individuals don't want the federal government in their business every day,\" Starr explained in reference to the American public. \"The fear that people have about digital identity is that it's a surveillance opportunity.\"",
      "Starr explained that some are concerned that any time a digital ID is used, it will then alert or \"phone home\" a government tracking system \u2013 a concern that privacy advocates like the\u00a0Electronic Frontier Foundation\u00a0and the\u00a0ACLU have flagged.",
      "\"It's not about the technology, but managing fear and managing what actually gets deployed,\" he added, noting that safeguards can be put in place to counter these concerns.",
      "Even though there is no federal version of a digital ID, more than a dozen states have already begun issuing mobile driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "A federal version of a digital ID would, in theory, just include an individual\u2019s information that the government already has access to, including details like passport information.",
      "But there\u2019s another major concern people flag when it comes to digital IDs \u2013 how to ensure personal information is protected from identity theft, which has become a major concern in recent years amid mass cyber breaches.",

      "Wang and her daughter Nori, 7, said they feel proud that such a popular costume -- \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d looks are already a top pick this year -- is rooted in Asian culture.",

      "Due to the film\u2019s late summer release, big retailers have scrambled to mass produce Rumi\u2019s purple wig and gold-black jacket and the black hanbok made iconic by demon heartthrob Jinu.",

      "Nori loved the outfit for the demon-slaying leader of three-member K-pop girl band Huntrix so much she has worn it every weekend, Wang said.",
      "\u201cMy daughter is definitely aware that the characters \u2018look more like her,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, Rumi is a brave, talented and fierce character who also shows vulnerability in a very relatable way.\u201d",

      "Young A Jung, an assistant professor at George Mason University who teaches modern Korean literature and pop culture, said one factor behind the mass appeal of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d might be the complexity of its central characters, Rumi and Jinu.",
      "\u201cGlobal teens and youth groups with complex everyday lives might no longer want to see clearcut Western-style heroes,\u201d Jung said, adding that the movie\u2019s exploration of the shame that K-pop idols feel, and their efforts to hide their pasts, is particularly resonant with fans.",

Later, the look became incorporated in folktales as the attire of grim reapers. Even the film\u2019s animal characters, the tiger and magpie, are inspired by Korean folk painting.",
      "Since the movie draws so heavily from Korean traditions, marketing the characters\u2019 outfits simply as trendy Halloween costumes can risk diluting their cultural importance, said Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and culture critic.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want these traditional garbs to become associated with \u2018demon wear,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see traditional clothing be co-opted and diminished by Hollywood.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Saturday reversed some layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after hundreds of scientists received \u201cincorrect notifications\u201d that they were laid off during the government shutdown, according to an official familiar with the matter.",
      "\u201cThe employees who received incorrect notifications were never separated from the agency and have all been notified that they are not subject to the reduction in force,\u201d the official told NBC News. \u201cThis was due to a glitch in the system.\u201d",
      "The reversed layoffs, first reported by The New York Times, come just after the administration moved to lay off thousands of federal workers during the government shutdown, prompting backlash from critics who argue the layoffs are illegal.",
      "The reduction-in-force moves are being challenged in court and mark the latest fallout from the government shutdown fight, which has stretched into its second week as lawmakers show no signs of moving closer to a deal.",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now or someone who is feeling the effects of shuttered services in your everyday life. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "Some 1,100 to 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services were sent layoff notices on Friday. A Friday court filing indicated that more than 4,000 federal workers were laid off, though it is unclear how that number has changed after the administration moved to reverse certain CDC layoffs.",
      "HHS and the Treasury Department originally accounted for more than half of the total layoffs, according to the court filing.",
      "Vice President JD Vance addressed the reversed layoffs in an interview on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d saying that a \u201cgovernment shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\u201d he said, going on to blame Democrats.",
      "Vance argued that layoffs were necessary to preserve critical government functions, adding that as that happens, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have some chaos.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn\u2019t want to lay off,\u201d he continued, addressing moderator Margaret Brennan. \u201cWe would like to reopen the government and ensure these essential services stay on, but unfortunately, in an environment where we\u2019re dealing with limited resources where the government is shut down, we\u2019ve got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability.\u201d",
      "In a separate interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Vance said that \u201cthe longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we\u2019re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.\u201d",
      "Democrats have continued pressing Republicans to negotiate over Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year, which would lead to higher premiums. Republicans are urging Democratic senators to flip their support to a clean short-term funding bill. Both Republican- and Democratic-led funding proposals have failed in the Senate numerous times."

      "Manchester's story is recounted in the new film \"Roofman,\" and Channing Tatum, who plays Manchester in the movie, admitted the real-life story of the robber is stranger than fiction in an interview on TODAY on Oct. 6.",
      "Repeating a line the film's director Derek Cianfrance would tell the cast and crew, Tatum recalled, \u201cHe always says, \u2018If this was a fiction, we\u2019d be the worst screenwriters on the face of the Earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tatum added that his reaction after reading the script was: \u201cThis can\u2019t all be true.\u201d",
      "Cianfrance, along with Kirt Gunn, wrote the screenplay for the film after researching Manchester's story and talking with him on the phone for about 400 hours, Cianfrance said in an interview on Morning Joe on Oct. 8.",
      "Tatum said on TODAY he also spoke with Manchester from Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, in preparation for the film, which was shot on location in Charlotte.",
      "\u201cI had all these lists of questions and things that I wanted to know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as soon as you get on the phone with him, he\u2019s just the most warm. I mean, he spent nine years in solitary confinement ... but you talk to this guy, and he like, kind of takes care of you on the phone. He really does. He\u2019s optimistic, he has all these dreams and plans when he gets out.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the true story behind \"Roofman,\" which premieres in theaters on Oct. 10, including Manchester's crimes and where he is now.",
      "Is \"Roofman\" Based on a True Story?",
      "\"Roofman\" is based on Manchester's life, starting with a robbery at a McDonald's in May 2000, according to the Charlotte Observer, which obtained newspaper archives, court documents and interviews with those close to the case.",
      "Manchester carved a hole in the roof of the McDonald's in Belmont, North Carolina, and ordered the workers to lie on the ground as he told another to open the safe \u2014 while holding a .22 caliber rifle.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re the good people,\u201d Manchester reportedly told the employees, according to the Observer. \u201cI\u2019m the bad guy. I\u2019m sorry for doing this to you.\u201d",
      "In addition to a robbery he committed the night before at another McDonald's in Gastonia, North Carolina, Manchester made out with more than $8,000 in cash.",
      "Manchester locked the workers in the freezer, though they\u2019d later break down the door and call police.",
      "As police headed to the McDonald's, one officer noticed a car in an empty church parking lot, and minutes later, Manchester approached the vehicle.",
      "The officer turned on his lights, called for backup and eventually police apprehended him after a brief chase. And about two hours later, Manchester confessed.",
      "The Observer reported Manchester, who had recently divorced from the mother of his three children, told police he did it for the money, \u201cto pay bills and buy things for my kids.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will do everything I can do to fix the situation. I still have a lot to give the community and the Army,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was going to be quick cash, and I ended up scaring people and wasted the police\u2019s time as well, and I am sorry for that.\u201d",
      "Authorities in California suspected Manchester was behind more than 40 other robberies in the state and others, as his military assignments would put him near the locations.",
      "Manchester told police in North Carolina he \u201cgot the idea from news of similar circumstances\u201d in California, and that he had \u201cnever done anything like this before, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Manchester was charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon, breaking and entering and eight counts of first-degree kidnapping, and he was held him on a $1 million bond, according to the Observer.",
      "He turned down a plea deal that would have let him serve 15 to 22 years in prison, and was later convicted of the charges, the Observer reported. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.",
      "But after serving just four years in prison, he escaped in June 2004 by hiding underneath a truck that took him beyond the prison walls, the Observer reported.",
      "Manchester then hitched rides to bring him to Charlotte, where he would make a home inside of a Toys R Us, per the Observer. An employee eventually found his makeshift home behind a false wall in the store, though Manchester would later just move into a different part of the store.",
      "Manchester also started frequenting Crossroads Church under the guise of the name John Zorn. There, he would meet Leigh Wainscott, a mother of three who was separated from her husband, played by Kirsten Dunst in \"Roofman.\"",
      "The pair began dating, with Wainscott under the impression that John was unmarried with no kids, per the Observer. He would later buy her a car and bring gifts for her kids when they'd meet up, the Observer reported.",
      "But on Dec. 26, 2004, he robbed the Toys R Us he had been living in, and when officers started investigating, they found a secret passageway that led them to the abandoned Circuit City next door, where they found a living space similar to the ones they found in the toy store, according to the Observer.",
      "Investigators found a fingerprint in the space, which was a match for Manchester, who had escaped from the state prison months before, per the Observer. They started showing Manchester's mugshot to people in the area, and on Jan. 5, 2005, they showed his photo at Crossroads Church to Wainscott.",
      "\u201cMiss Wainscott, the man that you\u2019ve been dating is not who you think he is,\u201d investigators told her, according to the Observer. \u201cHe\u2019s an escaped convict. He\u2019s considered extremely dangerous.\u201d",
      "They showed her Manchester's mug shot on America's Most Wanted, and she later helped investigators catch him.",
      "Manchester was set to take Wainscott out for dinner that night, as it was her birthday, and she called him to confirm he was picking her up, per the Observer. As investigators tailed his car, he stopped at a Bi-Lo grocery store to pick up flowers.",
      "Once he was at Wainscott's door, the tactical unit swarmed, and Manchester surrendered, according to the Observer.",
      "Authorities said they were able to connect him with other prior robberies at Toys R Us, as well as a break-in at a pawn shop and an arson at a dentist's office, according to the Observer.",
      "\u201cKnowing what we know now about him, how crafty and skilled (he was), I think he enjoyed the chase,\u201d Leigh told the Observer. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the money. ... I think he enjoyed eluding the police and being sneaky and seeing what he could get away with.\u201d",
      "Where is Jeffrey Manchester Now?",
      "Manchester is currently imprisoned at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, according to the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction, where he's serving time for kidnapping and other counts.",
      "He's serving the rest of his 35-year sentence for his crimes in Gaston County, and more than 25 years for his crimes in Charlotte concurrently, according to the Observer.",
      "His projected release date is Dec. 4, 2036, according to the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction."

      "In one of the most terrifying moments in the show\u2019s history, Latimer was bitten by a venomous banded sea krait snake while sitting at the beach close to his tribe camp.",
      "\"I opened my eyes, and the snake is latched onto the bottom of my foot, mouth wide open,\" Latimer told Entertainment Weekly. \"But it didn\u2019t hurt at the time. I just felt a tingling kind of sensation. And that\u2019s when I yelled to Alex. I\u2019m like, 'Guys, I think this thing just bit me!'\"",

      "The 36-year-old Canadian was rushed to the show\u2019s base camp where he was put on a stretcher and given an oxygen mask as the show\u2019s medical staff treated him.",

Because I don\u2019t remember who, but somebody did tell me that that was a very venomous snake and I need to get care, like, now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I was lying on that stretcher, man, you saw me say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be a dad\u2026\u2019\u201d",
      "Latimer recalled thinking in that moment, \u201cAm I ever going to get off this island? Am I again going to see my child? Ever am I going to meet my child? And that\u2019s when it sunk in, because I had tubes coming out of me. I had oxygen masks on.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat has been the most scared I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. When you think that you\u2019re dying, it\u2019s a feeling that I\u2019m never going to forget.\u201d",
      "The show's medical professionals were able to determine that the Latimer had sustained  a \u201cdry bite,\u201d which meant the snake released no venom into him.",
      "Still, the decision was made to remove Latimer from the game to allow him time to rest and recover.",
      "\"I can\u2019t even explain that feeling of I\u2019m not going to die. I\u2019m not going to die. And then it\u2019s like, 'OK, now I got to get back in this game. I got to go help my tribe with a challenge,'\" he recalled, adding, \"I did not think I was going to get pulled.\"",
      "Latimer told EW he reluctantly followed \"doctor's orders,\" and could \"respect\" their decision.",
      "\"But I have unfinished business out there, and it was a tough way to go,\" he added.",
      "The silver lining? Latimer made it home in time to see the birth of his son, Jax \u2014 that is, after he was airlifted to a hospital Brisbane, Australia, where additional doctors could examine him.",
      "\"I was there not for very long, and I have a couple of sisters who live there,\" he shared. \"I was able to be with them for an afternoon, and I flew home. I got home just under 48 hours before my kid was born.\"",
      "\"God works in mysterious ways. I think that God put that snake there for a reason, just to get me home,\" he said. \"And I hate saying that because I wanted that game so bad, but I also got to see the birth of Jax, and that\u2019s worth a million dollars. And I was there for my wife.\"",
      "\"So it\u2019s a blessing in disguise. I\u2019m (otherwise) never going to get that experience back of seeing my kid be born,\" he said, adding, \"Even though, like I said, I have unfinished business out there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Guinness\u201d is a Netflix hit. But how does the real Guinness family feel about the historical drama, based on their family\u2019s history?",
      "The show, which recounts the rise of the Irish brewery, shows a fictionalized version of what happened when Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, grandson of Guinness founder Arthur Guinness, died and left his fortune to his kids.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the extraordinary story of a family who happens to be the inheritors of the biggest brewery in the world,\u201d series creator Steven Knight told Netflix\u2019s press site Tudum in an interview.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young and are given the task of taking on this incredibly successful brand. The first priority is: Don\u2019t screw it up. And the second priority is to make Guinness even bigger.\u201d",
      "Since the story takes place in the 1800s, Knight said he couldn\u2019t access many details about his characters\u2019 pasts. Given the limited information, Knight told Tudum he filled in the blanks with a made-for-TV story.",
      "\u201cWhat I had to do is take things that these family members did, things that they said, achievements they made, mistakes that they made, and use them as stepping stones,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I had to fill in the gaps myself. It\u2019s just a question of saying, \u2018Here\u2019s the character that I imagine this person is. This is why they did that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the show's release, a few Guinness family descendants have weighed in. Descendant Ivana Lowell, who produced the show, estimated there are about 100 Guinness family members while speaking to Vanity Fair.",
      "Lowell told the New York Times the idea came to her while staying with \"many\" Guinness relatives in Leixlip, a town in Ireland.",
      "\u201cWe were halfheartedly watching \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019 and I thought, \u2018Oh, our family is so much more interesting and eccentric,'\" she said.",
      "Lowell previously wrote about her family in her 2010 memoir \u201cWhy Not Say What Happened?\u201d then teamed up with Knight to bring \u201cHouse of Guinness\u201d to life.",
      "Ultimately, Lowell said the show turned out to be a more \u201cgritty\u201d version of \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d Though she said she was \u201cnervous\u201d about what her family would say, she said she knew that they had a \u201cgood sense of humor.\u201d",
      "Then, other Guinness members publicly weighed in. In a first-person essay for The Times, Molly Guinness, great-great-great-granddaughter of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, said she laughed when she saw the show\u2019s first two episodes with her cousin, who has a \u201cfirmer grip\u201d on what happened long ago.",
      "She explained that she was amused by the character\u2019s personalities, which \u201ccome straight from a bingo card of modern clich\u00e9s about rich people.\u201d",
      "Molly Guinness noted that the series will definitely become a \u201cuseful GIF\u201d on her sibling\u2019s WhatsApp group.",
      "However, she said she wasn\u2019t pleased with how the drama portrayed Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness and Arthur Guinness as \u201cknaves and fools.\u201d",
      "\u201cBenjamin was a loving father and a great philanthropist,\u201d she said.",
      "She also approved of how the show displayed her family\u2019s charity work, although \"every charitable project is filmed through a lens of shame or self-preservation.\u201d",
      "Despite the show provoking \"righteous fury,\" Molly Guinness did say she was looking forward to watching it with her brother and cousins. \"The prospect of the laughter of all my brothers and cousins once they get their hands on it is a real joy,\" she said."

      "Prior to the Oct. 4 Season 51 premiere of the late-night sketch comedy series, a slew of cast members announced their departure from the show, with some sharing their candid thoughts on their seemingly abrupt exit.",
      "Among those leaving ahead of the new season are Heidi Gardner, who made her debut in 2017; Michael Longfellow, who joined the show in 2022; Devon Walker, who had a three-year run; and Emil Wakim, who only served as featured player on the program for one year.",
      "Following those departures, \u201cSNL\u201d shared in a Sept. 2 update that Please Don\u2019t Destroy group comedian Ben Marshall, as well as Veronika Slowikowska, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson and Tommy Brennan, would join the show as this season as featured players.",
      "Less than two week laters, a shock came to fans when Ego Nwodim, who many thought was already confirmed for the new season, announced she would officially be leaving \u201cSNL\u201d after seven seasons.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight,\u201d she wrote in part in an Instagram post Sept. 12.",
      "Nwodim, who began as a featured player on \u201cSNL\u201d in 2018 and then joined the main cast two years later, was one of the mainstays of the series, and notably one of the only eight Black women to have served as cast members in the series\u2019 50-year history.",
      "With Nwodim's departure, \"SNL\" now has no Black women cast members. After Rudolph left \"SNL\" in 2007, the show went seven years without a Black woman cast member, a streak that ended when Sasheer Zamata joined in 2014.",
      "When asked about the aforementioned cast shakeups and departures, Rudolph, who was an \u201cSNL\u201d cast member from 2000 to 2007, tells TODAY.com \u201cit was inevitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like every few years there\u2019s definitely a change. And I felt like it was inevitable. I mean, some people have been there for a really long time,\u201d she says before clarifying that she was not referencing Kenan Thompson, who\u2019s been a cast member for 22 years, making him the longest-tenured cast member in the show\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m never surprised,\u201d she continues while also noting that she\u2019s a little out of the loop. \u201cI don\u2019t know what goes on behind closed doors anymore. Obviously, when you work there, you have the ins and outs. But I just find out about it like everybody else.\u201d",
      "While Rudolph later quips that she has to get the scoop from Nwodim about her departure, she acknowledges that much has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cWhen I was starting out, I was doing improv and sketch comedy at The Groundlings, which is still a wonderful theater and such a great place to start, because it\u2019s a place where you can get on stage and actually create characters and work, work, work,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just like such an important training ground.\u201d",
      "Rudolph says it was a different time then, before the advent of social media and people putting their content on the internet. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that ability then,\u201d she explains.",
      "But the amount of effort and the work is still the same. \u201cI feel like practicing and doing and doing and doing and constantly doing and finding other funny people is the key,\u201d she continues, \u201cand just writing and performing and creating your own body of work.\u201d",
      "As far as who makes it on the show and how to land that coveted spot? The \"Loot\" star says it\u2019s really a mixed bag.",
      "\u201cThere are so many different types of people at 'SNL.' I\u2019m a sketch performer. Some people come to it as stand ups \u2014 just stand ups and \u2014 that\u2019s a whole other being that thrives there and then some people are just impersonators,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cThere are so many different paths to get there. But I think creating and creating and creating and being a part of something, whether you\u2019re a stand up or whether you\u2019re a part of a group, I think is so important to just stay active and be seen as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Though Rudolph has not divulged whether fans will see her again on the new season, it\u2019s safe to say the door remains open for the award-winning performer who nabbed an Emmy in 2020 for her portrayal of Vice President Kamala Harris on \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the case of Kamala, there was nothing to do but do it,\u201d she says.",
      "But there are some people she\u2019s just not interested in impersonating.",
      "\u201cThere have been other people, I think, definitely in the past, where I thought, \u2018Oh, God, I don\u2019t want to dress up like that lady' ... I feel like, if someone\u2019s a monster in real life, I definitely don\u2019t want to play them because I think somehow I don\u2019t want to totally be associated,\u201d she explains.",
      "As Rudolph gears up for her own projects, including the third season of her hit Apple TV+ series \u201cLoot,\u201d the comedian says she\u2019ll always have a soft spot for \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes strange not being on the show, because you feel like, \u201cOh, if I were there, I would really, I would really have fun doing that,\u201d she says.",

      "Authorities made a grisly discovery there in the small town of Plainfield in 1957, when the body of a local missing woman was found along with human remains and objects like lampshades and masks made out of human skin.",
      "Charlie Hunnam plays the murderer in the hit Netflix series \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" which dramatizes the horrific events of his crimes and their reverberation through pop culture. Elements of Gein's story have inspired horror classics like \"Psycho\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"",
      "Gein became known as \"The Butcher of Plainfield,\" making the town of about 700 people at the time a curiosity after his crimes made national headlines. The fate of his home then later became the subject of speculation about its destruction.",
      "Here's what to know about the farmhouse in Plainfield.",
      "What Was Found in Ed Gein's House?",
      "A local sheriff and a captain from a nearby sheriff department searched the house in 1957 and discovered a scene that left them reeling.",
      "The home was littered with garbage and had roaches and rodents scurrying about in a filthy kitchen.",
      "They then discovered the decapitated and gutted body of a missing local woman, Bernice Worden, hanging in the home, which they initially thought was a deer carcass, according to the book \"Unhinged: The Shocking True Story of Ed Gein,\" by Robert Keller. Gein later confessed to killing Worden.",
      "They also found a soup bowl that was made out of the top half of a human skull, as well as skulls hanging from the posts of Gein's bed. Gein later told investigators he exhumed the corpses of women from a local cemetery.",
      "Another horrifying discovering was a chair upholstered with human skin, as well as items like lampshades, a drum and a knife sheath made from human skin. They also found a collection of female genitalia, a box of human noses and death masks of skin pulled from victims' skulls and stuffed with paper and sawdust. One of them belonged to local innkeeper Mary Hogan, whom Gein confessed to killing after she had gone missing three years earlier.",
      "There also were odd discoveries like a coffee can filled with used chewing gum, a collection of old dentures and a washbasin filled with sand, according to Keller's book.",
      "Gein kept one area of the house sealed off and pristine \u2014 the bedroom of his late mother, Augusta Gein. His deep attachment to the severe and domineering Augusta, who died in 1945, is a persistent theme in \"Monster\" and Gein's life.",
      "Her room was filled with dust but otherwise was perfectly neat because it was left in the same state as the day she died from a stroke.",
      "Where Was Ed Gein's House?",
      "The isolated farmhouse was located on a 195-acre plot of land in Plainfield, Wisconsin, which was six miles from the nearest village via a dirt road.",
      "Plainfield's population at the time of his arrest was about 700 people. The town is located 155 miles northwest of Milwaukee and about 90 miles north of Madison.",
      "How Long Did Ed Gein Live in the Farmhouse?",
      "The Gein family initially lived in La Crosse, Wisconsin, before moving to a small dairy farm.",
      "In 1914, they purchased the 195-acre farmland that included a modest, two-story house that became more dilapidated as time went by due to the family's struggles with money.",
      "Ed and his older brother, Henry Gein, lived there with Augusta and their father, George Gein. George struggled with alcohol and was routinely berated and belittled by Augusta.",
      "George died in 1940 and then Ed's brother, Henry, died in 1944 under mysterious circumstances surrounding a wildfire on property near their home. There was suspicion that Henry Gein was Ed Gein's first victim.",
      "Gein continued to live in the Plainfield house with his mother, nursing her to health after she had a stroke following his brother's death. She then had another stroke and died in 1945.",
      "Gein then lived in the farmhouse alone, descending into madness while working odd jobs for money, until he was arrested in 1957. He was 51 years old at the time and had lived in the home for nearly his entire life.",
      "What Happened to the Home after Ed Gein Was Arrested?",
      "Following the news reports about Gein's crimes, the home became a tourist attraction. Morbidly curious people were driving from all over Wisconsin to see the crumbling old home, according to \"Unhinged.\"",
      "After Gein was found to be insane and committed to the former Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Wisconsin, an auction was scheduled to sell his belongings as well as the farm.",
      "Before the auction took place, the Plainfield fire department was called to the site of the farmhouse on March 20, 1958, to find it burning.",
      "\"The firemen stood impassively by as the building burned to the ground,\" Keller wrote in \"Unhinged.\"",
      "It was believed to be arson, but the fire warden, who was the son of Gein's victim Bernice Worden, did not launch an inquiry.",
      "Gein was told while in the hospital about the destruction of a home that his family had owned for 44 years.",
      "\"Just as well,\" he said with little emotion, according to \"Unhinged.\"",
      "The property containing the destroyed home was sold for $3,000, and the 1949 Ford he used to transport bodies he had exhumed from the cemetery sold for $760 to a sideshow operator named Bunny Gibbons. He toured the Midwest with the vehicle, charging 25 cents for people to sit in the \"ghoul car,\" according to Keller."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

      "Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign official, told NBC News: \u201cThe legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize will be irreparably damaged if it isn\u2019t awarded to President Trump in 2026. The voices calling for President Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 are only going to get louder.\u201d",
      "Few voices were louder than Trump\u2019s in making the case that he\u2019d earned the award this year. The president mounted a rare public campaign to win it based on seven peace deals he says he reached in global hotspots.",
      "He is inching closer to an eighth. A whirlwind bout of U.S.-led diplomacy has culminated in a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas militants may release the remaining hostages early next week. And Trump plans to fly to the region this weekend to sign the accord and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.",
      "Trump has long said he didn\u2019t expect the five-member Norwegian selection committee to give him the award. The betting markets saw it the same way. Early this week, Polymarket, a prediction betting site, had put his odds of winning at 2%.",
      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said. Nor is the committee likely to reward him for pulling out of such cross-border endeavors as the Paris climate agreement or the World Health Organization, they said.",
      "K\u00e5re Aas, Norway\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., said that Trump would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d for the prize if he ends the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars. Still, the president wouldn\u2019t be a shoo-in, he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements about absorbing Greenland and Canada \u201cwould also be considered by the committee,\u201d Aas said. \u201cThe committee doesn\u2019t necessarily give him the Nobel Peace Prize if there\u2019s peace in Gaza and Ukraine next year.\u201d"

      "Machado, 58, was recognized for keeping \"the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness\" and \"ever-expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela.\"",

      "William, 43, was speaking to campaigner Rhian Mannings at her home in south Wales. Mannings lost her one-year-old son, George suddenly in 2012 to an undiagnosed illness. Five days later, her husband Paul died by suicide. Mannings said Paul blamed himself for their son's death.",

      "Under the terms of the deal, the ceasefire should take effect within 24 hours.",

      "Trump's announcement on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",
      "But huge questions remain about whether Trump's 20-point plan can successfully resolve the long-term future of the Gaza Strip, with uncertainty over its directive for Hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.",
      "A spokesperson for Netanyahu's office said Thursday that a ceasefire would take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed on the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Separately, the United States military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support stabilization in Gaza and the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into the enclave, two U.S. officials familiar with the planning said.",
      "The U.S. troops will stay in Israel, where they will support logistics, transportation, engineering and planning, the officials said.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "While the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appeared imminent, explosions were seen and heard in southern Gaza on Thursday morning.",
      "Trump said Wednesday on social media that the sides had taken the \"first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace,\" calling it \"a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America.\"",
      "Among those to welcome the announcement was United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged \"all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement\" and described it as a \"momentous opportunity\" to recognize \"the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \"praised the great efforts made by President Trump and all mediators to reach this agreement.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he had \"a very moving and warm conversation\" with Trump in which they \"congratulated each other on the historic achievement of signing the agreement to release all the hostages,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The plan could come with a political cost for Netanyahu inside Israel. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, said Thursday on X that his party will \u201cbring down the government\u201d unless Hamas is \u201cdismantled.\u201d",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",

      "An international force tasked with finding missing hostages in the Gaza Strip will be established as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli broadcaster i24 reported, citing Israeli officials.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that no Palestinians would surrender their weapons, though he did not explain whether that was the group\u2019s official position.",
      "Prominent Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti, whose supporters dub the \u201cPalestinian Nelson Mandela,\u201d will not be released as part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told reporters Thursday.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."

      "Three U.S.-based scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for their discoveries in quantum mechanics.",
      "The award was given to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for \u201cexperiments that revealed quantum physics in action,\u201d the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.",
      "\u201cTo put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\u201d Clarke, 83, told reporters at the announcement by phone after having been told of his win.",
      "He paid tribute to the other two laureates, saying that \u201ctheir contributions are just overwhelming.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me,\u201d said Clarke, who is British but conducted his research at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "Speaking by cellphone, he added, \u201cOne of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.\u2019\u2019",
      "Martinis, an American, previously headed Google\u2019s quantum computing team. He conducted his research at the University of California, Santa Barbara, as did Devoret, who is also based at Yale. Devoret, who is French, is the chief scientist of Google Quantum AI.",
      "The Nobel winners carried out experiments in the 1980s with an electronic circuit built of superconductors and demonstrated that quantum mechanics could also influence everyday objects under certain conditions.",
      "The laureates\u2019 work continues to provide opportunities to develop \u201cthe next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors,\u201d the Nobel committee said.",
      "Olle Eriksson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said: \u201cIt is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology.\u201d",
      "Artificial intelligence pioneers John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the physics prize last year for helping create the building blocks of machine learning.",
      "Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week, after Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries about how the immune system knows to attack germs and not our bodies.",
      "The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize is set to be revealed Friday."
