      "One of the Middle East and North Africa\u2019s largest film festivals is openiong in Morocco, drawing actors and directors from throughout the world to present 70 features from 32 countries",
      "MARRAKECH, Morocco -- One of the Middle East and North Africa's largest film festivals opened Friday in Morocco, drawing actors and directors from throughout the world to present 70 features from 32 countries.",
      "The Marrakech International Film Festival, now in its 21st year, will showcase Oscar contenders and screen films for members of the public. But unlike larger festivals in Venice, Cannes or Toronto, it places unique emphasis on emerging directors and films from the Middle East and Africa.",
      "The roster of actors and directors who will participate in this year\u2019s conversations and tributes includes Sean Penn, Alfonso Cuaron and David Cronenberg.",
      "Remi Bonhomme, the festival's artistic director, said what makes the festival unique is its ability to draw talent on par with the world's largest festivals while also spotlighting up-and-coming directors from Morocco, the Middle East and Africa.",
      "\u201cWe pay a lot of attention to countries that are underrepresented in cinema,\u201d he said. \u201cWe support filmmakers who have their own voice, who develop a story that is in a specific context, whether it is Iran, Morocco or the U.S.\"",
      "\u201cBut they don\u2019t have to be the voice of their country. They have the need to have the freedom to express their own personal vision,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the themes that Bonhomme is excited about in this year's films is family. Filmmakers, including \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d director Mohammad Rasoulof, are \u201cexploring social and political impact through the scale of a family,\u201d Bonhomme said.",
      "The festival opens Friday with \u201cThe Order\u201d \u2014 a thriller starring Jude Law that chronicles an FBI manhunt for the leader of a white supremacist group.",
      "The jury competition contains 14 first or second films. The nine-person jury includes actors Jacob Elordi and Andrew Garfield as well as Ali Abbasi, the Iranian-Danish director of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Luca Guadagnino, the Italian-Algerian director of \u201cQueer\u201d will preside over the jury.",
      "The films in competition include Sa\u00efd Hamich's \u201cAcross the Sea\u201d about a young Moroccan man's immigration to Marseille and Damian Kocur's \u201cUnder the Volcano,\u201d Poland's Oscar entry for Best International Feature.",
      "The festival \u2014 founded by Morocco's King Mohammed VI and is presided over by his brother Prince Moulay Rachid \u2014 plays a major role in showcasing and promoting Moroccan films and directors.",
      "It has rarely shied away from diverse subject matter and this year will screen Moroccan films about immigration, homosexuality, bar performers and Moroccan communist Jews."

      "Merchandise is nothing new",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent Saturday afternoon, hundreds of \u201cAnora\u201d fans lined up for hours on Los Angeles' Melrose Avenue, hoping to snag exclusive merchandise inspired by Sean Baker\u2019s latest film about a stripper who marries the son of a Russian oligarch.",
      "The one-day-only pop-up from distributor Neon followed the success of a similar event in New York, hosted at the strip club at which the winner of the top prize at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival was filmed.",
      "Elated film buffs \u2014 many already wearing clothes inspired by movies like fellow Cannes hit \u201cThe Substance\u201d and the Nicolas Cage horror flick, \u201cLonglegs\u201d \u2014 relished the fruits of their labor at the front of the line, admiring their T-shirt and thong underwear purchases.",
      "\u201cExclusive is a buzzword, but it really is. It\u2019s an exclusive event because we all waited in line,\u201d said Nathan Zakim, who arrived at 10 a.m. for the 3 p.m. pop-up. \u201cWe all saw the movie. I think the movie merch mania should go on for as long as it can.\u201d",
      "Movie-themed merchandise is nothing new. Who can forget the iconic \u201cVote for Pedro\u201d T-shirt from \u201cNapoleon Dynamite\u201d that was seemingly everywhere in the early aughts?",
      "But in recent years, movie-inspired streetwear has exploded in popularity among film lovers, thanks in part to viral marketing campaigns put on by independent film studios. The result is clothing, often made in collaboration with popular brands, promoted as trendy and in limited supply.",
      "\u201cBeing this film buff type of person, I buy Blu-rays, I buy 4Ks. And that\u2019s not something that you can just pop out to someone and be like, \u2018I have this Criterion,\u2019\u201d said Natanael Avilez, who drove more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) for the \u201cAnora\u201d pop up. \u201cMerch is the second-best option of saying like, \u2018I do love movies and this is the way to express that.\u2019\u201d",
      "T-shirts are by far the most common form of merch, be it for Neon's Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d (2019) or, more recently, A24's \u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d with the infamous carousel horse emblazoned across the front.",
      "Some films, however, lend themselves to a more thematic marketing approach.",
      "\u201cFirst Reformed\u201d fans flocked to the sold-out denim hat featured in Paul Schrader's 2017 film about a pastor's descent into despair over the environment. The J. Hannah gold locket inspired by Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla\u201d (2023) is still on the market for $1,480.",
      "One catalyst in the trend\u2019s rise can be traced to 2018, when the clothing brand Online Ceramics and A24 joined forces. The brand, founded by artists Elijah Funk and Alix Ross, began with the idea of making bootleg T-shirts inspired by the Grateful Dead. Ross recounted two serendipitous moments in the company\u2019s history: One was watching Pete Davidson wearing a \u201cGood Time\u201d T-shirt on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\u201d in 2018.",
      "\u201cI was really jealous that we didn\u2019t make that,\u201d Ross recalled of Davidson\u2019s shirt, adorned with a poster image of Robert Pattinson and co-director Benny Safdie.",
      "The other was knowing, after just seeing the trailer, that Online Ceramics had to make \u201cHereditary\u201d T-shirts \u2014 with or without A24\u2019s permission. Thanks to a mutual friend, they managed to get in touch with the studio just before the film\u2019s release and got A24's stamp of approval.",
      "Hopeful online shoppers today will be disappointed as they scroll through dozens of Online Ceramics x A24 items, inspired by films like \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d \u201cMidsommar\u201d and \u201cLove Lies Bleeding,\u201d only to find each one sold out.",
      "Watching movies \u2014 following a pandemic and the rise of streaming \u2014 has become less of a collective experience in recent years. For many fans, repping their favorite films in public is a way to combat that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so fun knowing that everyone loves the movie so much to go stand in line for multiple hours. I got here three hours before it even opened and there\u2019s probably, like, 30 people in front of me,\u201d said Sabrina Bratt. \u201cPhysical keepsakes are just so cute and fun.\u201d",
      "For studios, the benefit is multifaceted. Not only is it an additional revenue source in a time of slowed production in Hollywood, it also is a way to engage with the fans that help keep their films in the zeitgeist long after they leave the theater.",
      "\u201cPeople, and particularly younger people, they want to be a part of something. And wearing a shirt for a movie is no different to wearing a shirt for the band that you just went to see. There\u2019s a cachet to it. There\u2019s a value to it. It\u2019s a sign of who I am,\u201d said Neon Chief Marketing Officer Christian Parkes.",
      "Alex Ng is the co-founder and creative director of the Los Angeles-based brand Brain Dead, which also owns a movie theater on Fairfax Avenue. As the film industry continues to evolve out of necessity, Ng contends this intersection of fashion and film will play an increasingly important role in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cWhat people want is like a token or a souvenir. They go to Disneyland and they get a Mickey, right? So, if you go to an arthouse cinema, there\u2019s not a lot of things or souvenirs you could take away from a film that you love,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to connect those pieces. And I think that\u2019s the new era that we\u2019re seeing as a movie-going experience.\u201d",
      "As the demand has grown for merchandise, studios and brands have sought to take advantage for films old and new.",
      "Searchlight Pictures recently released a handful of products to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Alexander Payne\u2019s buddy comedy for oenophiles, \u201cSideways,\u201d including tees, hats and, of course, wine keys.",
      "Brain Dead has done a handful of movie collaborations with studios like A24, Focus Features and, more recently, MUBI and Jordan Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw Productions.",
      "Some products are odes to cult classics, like \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d and \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d while others commemorate newer releases. Within days of announcing a limited-edition, long-sleeve shirt for \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 complete with a 30-day trial for MUBI \u2014 Brain Dead had sold out of the product online.",
      "Although Ng bristles at the idea of \u201chype,\u201d arguing it suggests something\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t sincere, he appreciates the ways in which demand for movie merchandise has grown: \u201cI think when we can speak to someone who loves films in that, that\u2019s really cool to me.\u201d",
      "Ross, too, is ambivalent about how popular merch has become.",
      "\u201cI cringe at seeing how many movie companies are trying to rip off what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s just kind of like, \u2018Damn.\u2019 Like I can\u2019t believe it got to this point.\u201d"

      "One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character",
      "LONDON -- One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character.",
      "In Miami, observers say the Dwyane Wade sculpture looks more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the former basketball star. Of course, the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo bust in 2017 gave the chiseled soccer star a chubby face and goofy smile.",
      "A statue of Mohamed Salah in 2018 depicted the Liverpool star with a disproportionately large head. In 2011, a terracotta warrior statue of Andy Murray at a Shanghai tennis tournament drew chuckles, including from the star himself: \u201cI thought I was better looking than that.\"",
      "It wasn't always this way. In classical times, sculptors \u201chad absolutely no interest in depicting people accurately,\u201d explained Lucy Branch, a London-based sculptural conservator.",
      "\u201cWhat they ended up doing quite often, they recycled sculptures so when another athlete became more prominent, they just changed the name on the plaque,\u201d said Branch, host of the \u201cSculpture Vulture\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea now, in this era, that commemorative sculpture should be like portraiture \u2014 it should look exactly like the person they are commemorating. But actually that's a really new idea in sculpture.\"",
      "To avoid pitfalls, here are some tips from sculptors:",
      "London-based sculptor Hywel Pratley studied countless images of Queen Elizabeth II to create a memorial statue in the East Midlands town of Oakham.",
      "\u201cA good portrait sculpture is evidence of 1,000 decisions after 10,000 observations,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "In addition, Yorkshire county sculptor Steve Winterburn recommends getting close with a subject's family and friends to help find characteristics.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want it looking like a Madame Tussauds,\u201d said Winterburn, who created a statue of five Rugby League greats at Wembley Stadium. \u201cIt still needs a bit of art in it, a bit of soul. That\u2019s what makes art really sing.\u201d",
      "The Ronaldo bust depicted the Portugal star smiling crookedly. Likewise, the Salah sculpture features the Egyptian smiling while celebrating a goal. In Miami, Wade's mouth is open in the statue representing the moment the player famously jumped onto a courtside table and yelled \u201cThis is my house.\u201d",
      "It's probably best avoided.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to do teeth looking good in sculpture,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "Start \"by understanding the profile\" before moving on to determine widths from the front view, Pratley said.",
      "\u201cGet the profile right and you will have won half the battle, because then you can have something at least that you can trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re lost, you can say, \u2018well I knew where I was then,\u2019 \u2014 and you will get lost as a sculptor in the forms.",
      "\"There\u2019s so many to understand. It\u2019s not two dimensions, it\u2019s three. There\u2019s an exponential opportunity for everything to go wrong. If you\u2019ve got the profile, then you can go forward with more confidence.\u201d",
      "Winterburn tries to make the eyes \u201ccome alive\u201d in his work.",
      "\"The eye is the soul of the person that carries it,\" he said. \u201cIf you look at a lot of public work, I\u2019m not being funny, they\u2019re dead. There\u2019s nothing in them, they\u2019re just featureless, soulless. With a painting, if in doubt, fade it out. With sculpture, there is nowhere to hide.\"",
      "For Pratley, especially when he is working with a live model, \u201cI\u2019m often struck by how the absolute essence of somebody is somewhere between the nostrils and the mouth. The flicker of muscles and the subtle movement of muscles around the mouth is so much you \u2014 it\u2019s so much that person.\u201d",
      "Commemorative sculpture historically has been on plinths, Branch notes.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason for that is because we put our heroes on a pedestal,\" she said. \"The problem is, the lower to the ground the sculpture is, the more scrutiny it\u2019s going to get and the less it can get away with not looking quite right.\u201d",
      "The Kane sculpture features the England captain seated.",
      "\u201cBeing so low, people get to look at it incredibly closely,\u201d Branch said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get sculpture to be more with the people, but then that comes with its own problems.\u201d",
      "In the UK, local councils \u2014 like a city council in the US \u2014 might propose a project, fund it and select the sculptor, sometimes with little input from the public and limited vetting of artists.",
      "Branch says there's a better way: Vote on it.",
      "That's what happened for the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Manchester. A selection committee used an online platform to get public input and Hazel Reeves' proposal to honor the suffragette won.",
      "\u201cIt is a really good balance and check for whether people on the committees have chosen the right sculptor or the right composition for that person who is being commemorated,\u201d Branch said. \u201c(The public) may not necessarily be highly educated about sculpture, but they always tend to know whether the artist has hit the nail on the head.\u201d",

      "Five years after a catastrophic fire reduced Notre Dame Cathedral to a smoldering shell, journalists entered the Gothic masterpiece for a first glimpse of its fully restored interiors during a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "PARIS -- Five years after a catastrophic fire reduced Notre Dame Cathedral to a smoldering shell, journalists got a first glimpse of the Gothic masterpiece's fully restored interiors during a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. The transformation is nothing short of breathtaking: light dances across brilliant stone, gilded accents gleam anew, and the iconic monument's majesty is reborn. From Dec. 8, visitors will once again marvel at the cathedral\u2019s blend of history and craftsmanship.",
      "Here\u2019s a reporter\u2019s-eye view:",
      "The nave, once darkened by soot and rubble, now radiates a celestial brilliance. Visitors can see the true color of the cathedral\u2019s walls: a pale Lutetian limestone \u2014 named after the Roman word for Paris, Lutecia \u2014 that glows under sunlight streaming through restored stained-glass windows. The newfound blond hues highlight the soaring Gothic columns and ribbed vaults, creating a bright and uplifting atmosphere. Restorers say it's the first time in centuries the true stone has been exposed in this way.",
      "The polished checkerboard marble floor, glistening underfoot, is so smooth it seems you could glide across it \u2014 communicating with the gilded, golden grille partition of the choir area.",
      "Overhead, incandescent chandeliers hang majestically from each vaulted arch, stretching from west to east, casting a warm, golden light throughout the nave.",
      "The meticulous restoration process involved cleaning over 42,000 square meters of stone \u2014 an area equivalent to roughly six soccer fields \u2014 using innovative latex peels to strip away centuries of grime without causing damage. Conservators uncovered mason marks etched by medieval builders \u2014 intimate traces of the artisans who shaped Notre Dame in the 12th and 13th centuries.",
      "This gleaming transformation is a stark contrast to the wreckage of 2019, when the nave was strewn with charred debris.",
      "The altar in the cathedral\u2019s chancel carries a poignant symbol of the fire\u2019s devastation. Nicolas Coustou\u2019s Piet\u00e0, part of the V\u0153u de Louis XIII ensemble, survived largely unscathed, but molten lead from the blaze fused into the hand of Christ. Restorers chose to preserve this as a subtle, yet powerful, reminder of the tragedy.",
      "Surrounding the altar, the intricate marquetry floor, long hidden under layers of dirt, has been pieced together from fragments recovered after the fire.",
      "Nearby, the polished Cross of Glory, which famously \u2014 literally \u2014 glowed amid the flames, now stands restored to its full brilliance. Framed by the radiant blonde stonework of the nave, the cross serves as a centerpiece of the cathedral\u2019s rebirth.",
      "The grand organ, among the largest and most storied in France, has undergone an intricate revival. Spared from the flames but coated in lead dust, its 8,000 pipes, ranging in size from that of a pen to over 10 meters (33 feet) tall, were painstakingly disassembled, cleaned, and retuned. Over two years, this work was performed with precision in the cathedral\u2019s silent, cavernous interior, where harmonization was achieved entirely by ear.",
      "Now, the organ\u2019s grandeur is unmistakable. Its towering wooden case, marked with carvings left by past craftsmen, gleams under sunlight streaming through restored clerestory windows. Even in silence, it commands awe.",
      "The 29 chapels circling the nave and choir burst with color and detail previously dulled by dirt and neglect. Restorers revealed intricate murals, gilded stars on ceilings, and vibrant motifs originally created under Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s direction. Each chapel tells a unique story through its designs and themes.",
      "The Chapel of Saint Marcel stands out as a masterpiece, its mural of the saint\u2019s relics vividly restored. Visitors are captivated by its radiant colors, producing an effect likened to the Sistine Chapel in Rome \u2014 a visual firework display. In other chapels, traces of 19th-century painters\u2019 color tests, hidden in nooks, provide glimpses into their artistic process.",
      "The transept crossing, where the original spire collapsed, presented one of the restoration\u2019s most formidable challenges. Above, soaring new vaults of Lutetian limestone replicate the medieval originals with remarkable precision.",
      "Beneath the crossing, archaeologists uncovered a trove of history: fragments of Notre Dame\u2019s medieval jub\u00e9, or choir screen, buried in the rubble. These intricately carved stones, some still bearing faint traces of polychrome paint, provide a rare glimpse into the cathedral\u2019s vibrant 13th-century decorative history.",
      "The newly restored roof draw gazes skyward, where medieval timber techniques have been faithfully recreated. Known as \u201cthe forest,\u201d the intricate wooden framework remains hidden beneath the roofline, but glimpses into the rafters reveal the precision of both ancient and modern craftsmanship.",
      "Outside, the spire rises 96 meters, faithfully replicating Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s 19th-century design. Clad in oak and lead, it stands crowned by a gilded rooster containing relics of St. Denis, St. Genevieve, and a fragment of the Crown of Thorns, alongside a scroll listing contributors to the restoration.",
      "The spire also honors the late General Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the project until his death in 2023. His name is now etched at its base.",
      "There\u2019s more than meets the eye in this restoration. Notre Dame now features unseen state-of-the-art fire prevention systems to guard against future disasters. Thermal cameras monitor the roof, and a fine misting system, designed to extinguish flames at their source, is seamlessly integrated into the structure. Fireproof barriers divide the roof into compartments, preventing flames from spreading.",
      "Reinforced water supply lines can deliver 600 cubic meters (21,188 cubic feet) of water per hour, ensuring the cathedral is better protected than ever before.",

      "Allen and Steinfeld were first linked in the spring of 2023, when they were photographed dining together in New York City. Months later, Allen acknowledged the two were dating, but asked The Associated Press not to mention Steinfeld by name in a bid to maintain a semblance of privacy.",
      "Steinfeld has since begun attending Bills home games, and the couple hosted a Halloween party this fall.",
      "The 27-year-old Steinfeld is from Los Angeles and began her acting career at age 10. She earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers\u2019 2010 remake of \u201cTrue Grit.\u201d She also received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the 2016 high school dramedy \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen.\u201d Her other credits include \u201cBumblebee,\u201d \u201cDickinson\u201d and Marvel's \u201cHawkeye,\u201d along with voice roles in \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d and its sequel.",

      "The stress of Thanksgiving is over",
      "NEW YORK -- The stress of Thanksgiving is over. Now it's time to heat up leftovers, relax on the couch and enjoy the smooth sounds of a wrongly mocked music genre: yacht rock.",
      "The late-'70s songs of Steely Dan, Michael McDonald and Christopher Cross take center stage Friday in the well-crafted Max documentary \u201cMusic Box: Yacht Rock: A DOCKumentary.\u201d",
      "Director Garret Price marries interviews with yacht rock artists, current musicians who are fans and the creators of the parody web series who coined the genre's name in 2005.",
      "\u201cThis music is the soundtrack to our lives, whether we want it or not. It\u2019s playing in grocery stores, pharmacies, doctor\u2019s offices, elevators, our parents' cars our whole life,\" says Price. \u201cI kind of took it for granted because it\u2019s just there. I think a lot of people have abandoned this music and I\u2019m hoping those people rediscover it.\u201d",
      "So who exactly made yacht rock? The experts in the film argue it is Toto, McDonald, Kenny Loggins, the Doobie Brothers, Cross and Steely Dan \u2014 described as \u201cthe primordial ooze from which yacht rock sprang.\u201d Think songs like \u201cRide Like the Wind\u201d by Cross, \u201cReelin\u2019 In the Years\u201d by Steely Dan and \u201cRosanna\u201d by Toto.",
      "What\u2019s not yacht rock \u2014 at least according to the filmmakers \u2014 is the Eagles, Hall & Oates, Jimmy Buffett or Fleetwood Mac, who don\u2019t perfectly fit the definition: elevated pop music infused with jazz and R&B.",
      "Cross, McDonald, Loggins and Toto\u2019s David Paich and Steve Porcaro discuss the music and how they handled the label. Donald Fagen of Steely Dan only had a short phone call with Price, but allowed the band's music to be used.",
      "\u201cI had this film basically done except for the Steely Dan music syncs and it was sitting idle for months and was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to tell this story unless I get this music.\u2019 Lo and behold, we finally hear from Donald Fagen,\u201d says Price. \u201cWe have this moment that I don\u2019t even know if I could beat if I had a sit-down interview with him.\u201d",
      "Giving context are musician-comedian Fred Armisen, musician-author Questlove, musicians Thundercat, Brian Robert Jones and Brenda Russell, producer Prince Paul and rock critics and session players.",
      "Questlove opens the door to a less restricted definition of yacht rock, adding artists like Al Jarreau, the Pointer Sisters and George Benson, arguing that the genre isn\u2019t limited to white artists.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a completely arbitrary genre like this that got made up completely, that\u2019s kind of the beauty of it \u2014 the debates of what is or isn\u2019t,\u201d says Price.",
      "Yacht rock enjoyed a brief window on the charts in the late 1970s and the documentary argues that MTV largely contributed to its demise. Yacht rockers weren't able or willing to transition into a visual space.",
      "Once that window closed, yacht rock became derided \u2014 mocked in everything from \u201c30 Rock\u201d to \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d In \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin,\u201d a character tortures her electronics store co-workers by playing McDonald on a constant loop.",
      "\u201cI feel like these artists have always been kind of punchlines in pop culture,\u201d says Price. \u201cI went in saying, \u2018I want to make a fun film but not make fun of anybody.\u2019\u201d",
      "The label \u201cyacht rock\u201d came much later thanks to a comedy series of short films by J.D. Ryznar and Steve Huey, who currently lead The Yacht or Nyacht Podcast. They were hoping to win a contest with their short films and the name took off.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of a private in-joke that sort of went global all of a sudden,\u201d says Huey. \u201cThe underlying intent is we love this music. We poke some fun at it, but we also want people to hear it for what it is, which is really, really good, solid, well-crafted music.\u201d",
      "Ryznar says the label was inspired by the cover and name of \u201cFull Sail\u201d \u2014 an album from Loggins and Jim Messina \u2014 Cross' hit single \u201cSailing\u201d and the captain-hat wearing half of Captain & Tennille.",
      "\"We just noticed this '70s motif and it seemed to describe the music that was so well-produced so perfectly,\" Ryznar says. \u201cIt\u2019s not called yacht rock because it sounds good on a boat, though it does. It\u2019s called yacht rock because it\u2019s well crafted, like the finest yacht.\u201d",
      "Price, an editor on \u201cDaisey Jones & The Six\u201d who also directed the dark \u201cWoodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage,\u201d says his latest work arrives at a great time in the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect post-Thanksgiving film to watch with your family after what may be a more contentious Thanksgiving this year than others,\u201d says Price. \u201cWe can all just chill out, vibe out, listen to this smooth, polished music and just smile.\u201d"

      "Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna\u2019s high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience",
      "SAO PAULO -- Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna's high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience.",
      "The legendary Brazilian driver \u2014 who was killed when his car hit a concrete wall at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 \u2014 is the subject of a six-episode Netflix series that debuts on Nov. 29 and follows him from his early go-kart days to that fatal Sunday afternoon at the Imola track in Italy.",
      "Even three decades after that accident, few F1 figures evoke as much emotion and passion among fans and fellow drivers as Senna, who won three championship titles before his death at the age of 34.",
      "Senna\u2019s complex personality \u2014 he was a saint to his millions of Brazilian fans and a sinner to some critics who deemed his driving style too aggressive \u2014 comes to life through Brazilian actor Gabriel Leone, who embraced the challenge of portraying such a popular figure.",
      "\u201cHe was much more than an F1 driver for us, he became an icon, much beyond his technique and his driving,\u201d Leone told The Associated Press in an interview in Sao Paulo. \u201cHe had this humanity, this honesty. The things he said, his values, it all made him closer to people.\u201d",
      "Senna's life and career had no shortage of made-for-TV moments.",
      "This was a driver who once won a race with his car stuck in sixth gear in front of thousands of raucous fans at the Interlagos track. And who went from fifth position to first in one lap at the 1993 European Grand Prix. And who jumped out of his car during a training session to save the life of a French driver who had crashed.",
      "On the track, his rivalry with French driver Alain Prost was one of the most intense that F1 has ever seen. Off the track, he had some high-profile relationships as well and dated several models, including Elle Macpherson.",
      "\u201cFor me as an actor, the more complex the character is, the better. It is more interesting to build him and live him. And this is quite a character, the biggest hero in Brazil, not only in sport,\u201d Leone said. \u201cAyrton was transcendent, he was more than an F1 driver. That\u2019s a guy who is the hero of great drivers in history, like (Michael) Schumacher and (Lewis) Hamilton.\u201d",
      "Senna won the drivers\u2019 championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991 with the McLaren team and moved to Williams in the year he died as the favorite to lift the title again.",
      "For Leone, though, it was also important to portray him as a person who understood his role as a national hero, who advocated for the poor and proudly waved a Brazilian flag from his cockpit during every victory lap.",
      "\u201cHe was not distant, he was close,\" said Leone, who attended a red carpet premiere in Sao Paulo on Tuesday with several other cast members and director Vicente Amorim. \"That\u2019s for Brazilians and non-Brazilians. It was like this, and it still is like this.\u201d",
      "To many international fans, Senna was simply an exceptional talent who was born to be a driver. Even former rival Martin Brundle, now a TV pundit, once likened Senna's ability to find grip on some corners to a dance seemingly innate to a Brazilian.",
      "\u201cIt is a different kind of samba that I could not do,\u201d Brundle has said.",
      "The Netflix series, however, shows some of the hard work and attention to detail that went into Senna becoming a wet-weather master.",
      "The streaming giant \u2014 which reportedly invested more than $170 million in its production \u2014 also takes a bit of liberty with the truth when it comes to building up the animosity between Senna and one of his other real-life antagonists, Jean-Marie Balestre, the French former president of F1's governing body FIA.",
      "Balestre is often accused by fans of aiding his countryman Prost in his rivalry with Senna, including at the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix by stopping the race early before the Brazilian driver could overtake his French rival in the heavy rain. And at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix, when Senna was disqualified in a decision that handed the championship title to Prost.",
      "The Netflix series goes a step further by making Balestre (played by Arnaud Viard) the man responsible for Senna also losing a go-kart title as a youngster, long before he even entered F1.",
      "\u201cIf that was true it would be news to every reporter covering Senna\u2019s story over the last decades,\u201d said Ernesto Rodrigues, who wrote a biography on the three-time F1 champion. \u201cYes, Senna had Balestre working against him many times. But Balestre was an autocrat with other drivers, too. It wasn\u2019t exclusive.\u201d",
      "Prost, played by Matt Mella, goes from being a racing foe to a friend after his retirement in the series just like in real life. The friction between the two as McLaren teammates and then in the title-deciding races in the 1989 and 1990 seasons create some of the best moments of the series for racing fans.",
      "Three of the women in Senna\u2019s life also appear in the series.",
      "Scenes with L\u00edlian de Vasconcellos Souza, who married Senna in 1981 and divorced him the next year, help show how the Brazilian was driven to go into F1 early in his career. Xuxa Meneghel, a wildly popular TV host, is featured for a full episode as the driver\u2019s most important girlfriend. Adriane Galisteu, who was the champion\u2019s girlfriend when he died, appears for less than three minutes.",
      "Senna's importance to today's F1 drivers was on full display at the Brazilian Grand Prix this month, when Hamilton \u2014 the British seven-time F1 champion \u2014 drove one of Senna's old cars around the track as part of the tributes marking the 30th anniversary of his death.",
      "\u201cThis is the greatest honor of my life,\u201d Hamilton said on Nov. 3. \u201cI hope I made Senna proud.\u201d",

      "Police in Boulder, Colorado, are refuting assertions that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey that they are not pursuing",
      "DENVER -- Amid renewed interest in the killing of JonBenet Ramsey triggered in part by a new Netflix documentary, police in Boulder, Colorado, refuted assertions this week that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of the 6-year-old girl that they are not pursuing.",
      "JonBenet Ramsey, who competed in beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her family\u2019s home in the college town of Boulder the day after Christmas in 1996. Her body was found several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenet competing in pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States.",
      "The police comments came as part of their annual update on the investigation, a month before the 28th anniversary of JonBenet\u2019s killing. Police said they released it a little earlier because of the increased attention on the case, apparently referring to the three-part Netflix series \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the department welcomes news coverage and documentaries about the killing of JonBenet, who would have been 34 this year, as a way to generate possible new leads. He said the department is committed to solving the case but needs to be careful about what it shares about the investigation to protect a possible future prosecution.",
      "\u201cWhat I can tell you though, is we have thoroughly investigated multiple people as suspects throughout the years and we continue to be open-minded about what occurred as we investigate the tips that come into detectives,\" he said.",
      "The Netflix documentary focuses on the mistakes made by police and the \u201cmedia circus\u201d surrounding the case.",
      "JonBenet was bludgeoned and strangled. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever prosecuted.",
      "Police were widely criticized for mishandling the early investigation into her death amid speculation that her family was responsible. However, a prosecutor cleared her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and brother Burke in 2008 based on new DNA evidence from JonBenet's clothing that pointed to the involvement of an \u201cunexplained third party\u201d in her slaying.",
      "The announcement by former district attorney Mary Lacy came two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer. Lacy called the Ramseys \u201cvictims of this crime.\u201d",
      "John Ramsey has continued to speak out for the case to be solved. In 2022, he supported an online petition asking Colorado\u2019s governor to intervene in the investigation by putting an outside agency in charge of DNA testing in the case. In the Netflix documentary, he said he has been advocating for several items that have not been prepared for DNA testing to be tested and for other items to be retested. He said the results should be put through a genealogy database.",
      "In recent years, investigators have identified suspects in unsolved cases by comparing DNA profiles from crime scenes and to DNA testing results shared online by people researching their family trees.",
      "In 2021, police said in their annual update that DNA hadn\u2019t been ruled out to help solve the case, and in 2022 noted that some evidence could be \u201cconsumed\u201d if DNA testing is done on it.",
      "Last year, police said they convened a panel of outside experts to review the investigation to give recommendations and determine if updated technologies or forensic testing might produce new leads. In the latest update, Redfearn said that review had ended but that police continue to work through and evaluate a \u201clengthy list of recommendations\u201d from the panel.",

      "The family said McGee died of complications from a stroke at her home in Gardnerville, Nevada, on Wednesday, the day before the release of the short documentary \u201cMotorcycle Mary\u201d on ESPN\u2019s YouTube channel.

    "story": [
      "Angelina Jolie glides through the final days of Maria Callas in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria.\"",
      "Angelina Jolie glides through the final days of Maria Callas' short life in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria,\u201d a dramatic, evocative elegy to the famed soprano. It\u2019s an affair that\u2019s at turns melancholy, biting and grandly theatrical, an aria for a once in a generation star.",
      "Reality is of little consequence on the stage and in \u201cMaria.\u201d It\u2019s all about the raw feeling, which serves the movie well, more dream than history lesson about La Callas. Early on, she pops some Mandrax and tells her devoted butler Ferruccio (a simply wonderful Pierfrancesco Favino) that a television crew is on the way. Are they real, he wonders.",
      "\u201cAs of this morning, what is real and what is not real is my business,\u201d she says calmly and definitively, making a feast out of Steven Knight\u2019s sharp script. It\u2019s one of many great lines and moments for Jolie, whose intensity and resolve belie her fragile appearance. And it\u2019s a signal to the audience as well: Don\u2019t fret about dull facts or that Jolie doesn\u2019t really resemble Callas all that much. This is a biopic as opera \u2014 an emotional journey fitting of the great diva, full of flair, beauty, betrayal, revelations and sorrow.",
      "In \u201cMaria,\u201d we are the companion to a protagonist with an ever-loosening grip on reality, walking with her through Paris, and her life, for one week in September 1977.",
      "The images from cinematographer Ed Lachman, playfully shifting in form and style, take us on a scattershot journey through her triumphs on stage, her scandalous romance with Aristotle Onassis (Haluk Bilginer) and her traumatic youth. In the present, at age 53, she sleeps till midday, drinks the minimal calories she ingests, goes to restaurants where the waiters know her name looking for adulation and has visions of performances staged just for her all around the city.",
      "Callas is always immaculately dressed and assured, whether reflecting to the imagined news crew (led by Kodi Smit-McPhee) or attempting to find her voice again. Her instrument had famously diminished, leaving her wondering what\u2019s left to live for. The only consistent praise she gets is from her obedient housemaid Bruna (Alba Rohrwacher). It\u2019s no secret that the destination is death. And you suspect that she knows quite well that everything will be a big dimmer when her spotlight is turned off.",
      "Larra\u00edn has made a lasting mark on cinema with his unofficial trilogy about these famous women with tragic narratives. With \u201cJackie,\u201d\u201cSpencer\u201d and now \u201cMaria,\u201d his films are also an unintentional antidote to Ryan Murphy\u2019s stranglehold of the grand dames of recent history, which are all style and scandal and little substance. And yet Larra\u00edn's films are not for everyone. If \u201cJackie\u201d and \u201cSpencer\u201d did not speak to you, did not show those women as you hoped they would, \u201cMaria\u201d will not turn you into a believer. Three movies in, it seems that audiences are either very on board with his vision or not. There is little room for an in between.",
      "And yet it's hard to deny that his films are incredible showcases for actors. Jolie as a movie star is somehow both omnipresent and elusive, and lately she chooses to step in front of the camera all too infrequently. Sometimes you wish she could just follow in Nicole Kidman\u2019s footsteps, for whom quantity does not seem to ever jeopardize quality, and she seems to be having fun doing it all, all the time. Perhaps it\u2019s because performances like Jolie\u2019s in \u201cMaria\u201d look so all-consuming.",
      "In the film, Maria scolds a fan for daring to question that she faked sickness to miss a performance. He doesn\u2019t understand the total commitment of body and soul required to make it look effortless, which is probably true. Jolie is not so dramatic, at least publicly, about what it takes to create art. But here the lines blur: Character and actor blend so seamlessly, so ferociously, that you leave not just with heightened empathy for La Callas but Jolie as well.",
      "In one of the film\u2019s few regrettable scenes, she\u2019s put face to face with John F. Kennedy (no fault of Caspar Phillipson), whose wife has caught the greedy eye of Onassis. As a testament to the power of Jolie and the script, you almost forgive yet another JFK impersonation for giving her one of the great brushoffs to utter, romantic and withering all at once. Is it all a little much? Of course, but that\u2019s kind of the point of Maria.",
      "\u201cMaria,\u201d a Netflix release in select theaters now and streaming Dec. 11, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201ca sexual reference, some language.\u201d Running time: 122 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \u201cill intent\u201d to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \u201cpredatory behavior\u201d and \u201cblatant and repeated sexual harassment\u201d \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others\u2019 points of view.\"",
      "\u201cOn reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\u201d the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\u201d",
      "Rose\u2019s downfall was part of America\u2019s #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \u201cCharlie Rose Show.\u201d",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. They accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \u201csexually inappropriate\u201d while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \u201cvery subtle\u201d and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \u201calways professional and respectful.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES -- Rocker Marilyn Manson has agreed to drop a lawsuit against his former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, and to pay her attorneys' fees, lawyers for both sides said Tuesday.",
      "The move comes 18 months after a Los Angeles County judge threw out much of the 2022 suit in which Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, claimed Wood had fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to fabricate their own allegations.",
      "\u201cAfter four years of fighting a battle where he was able to tell the truth, Brian is pleased to dismiss his still-pending claims and appeal in order to close the door on this chapter of his life,\" Manson attorney Howard King said in a statement.",
      "Manson had been appealing the judge's decision but his attorneys reached out to Wood's seeking a settlement in the spring. Wood's attorneys said Tuesday that she rejected requests that the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Manson \u201cfiled a lawsuit against Ms. Wood as a publicity stunt to try to undermine the credibility of his many accusers and revive his faltering career,\u201d Wood\u2019s lawyer Michael J. Kump said in a statement. \u201cBut his attempt to silence and intimidate Ms. Wood failed.\u201d",
      "Manson agreed to pay nearly $327,000 in attorney fees for Wood.",
      "The settlement comes nearly four years into a criminal investigation of the 55-year-old Manson involving multiple women that remains unresolved. Outgoing LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in October that his office's sex crimes division had just discovered new evidence and that a decision on whether to file charges would be made when the picture was more complete.",
      "The women involved in the criminal case have not been identified, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esme Bianco has said she was among them, and criticized the district attorney for taking so long to investigate. Bianco settled her own lawsuit against Manson last year.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Wood and Bianco have.",
      "Manson has denied engaging in any non-consensual sexual acts.",
      "In 2017, with the #MeToo movement gaining momentum, Wood said publicly that she had been raped and abused, and gave testimony on the subject to a Congressional committee in 2018, but did not name anyone in either instance.",
      "Then in a 2020 Instagram post, Wood said it was Manson who had \u201chorrifically abused me for years.\u201d The two revealed they were a couple in 2007, and were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "Manson's original lawsuit alleged that Wood and another woman, Ashley Gore, also known as Illma Gore in court papers, defamed him, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film. It says they used false pretenses, including a phony letter from the FBI, to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say. The suit said Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet dismissed the part of the suit dealing with the disputed FBI letter, which Wood denied forging. Beaudet also tossed out a section that alleges Wood and Gore used a checklist found on an iPad for other women to use to make abuse claims about Manson.",
      "Other parts of the lawsuit had remained because they were not subject to Wood\u2019s motion, including allegations that Gore hacked Manson\u2019s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was sending illegal pornography, and \u201cswatted\u201d him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home.",
      "Gore's part of the lawsuit was dismissed and Manson paid $130,000 in her attorney fees."

      "Last week, TWICE expanded their brand beyond their usual K-pop fandom after the Cleveland Browns upset the Pittsburgh Steelers. The nine-member group made Amazon Music history.

      "The experience offers a variety of attractions including flat-screen TVs above a massive circular bar, a spacious VIP section, photo booth, themed locker room, digital bonfire, featured vehicle, jersey patch station and a towering football toss game. All of this is set to the music of the week's concert series performer blasted through loudspeakers.",
      "\u201cI wanted a space that was intentional and inclusive to everybody,\u201d said Jameka Pankey, the head of events and experiential for artists at Amazon Music. She and her team wanted to make a concerted effort to pay homage to performers and the fans who enjoy their work.",
      "\u201cWe thought about all aspects of football and tailgating from fellowship, food and even how we were naming the drinks,\u201d Pankey said. \u201cWhen we were giving away gifts to fans. ... We had to do jerseys. I wanted this to be a fan experience that was out of mind.\u201d",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "At Amazon Music, collaboration has fueled success with departments joining forces to lock in the hottest talent of the week.",
      "But predicting a year out? That's a tough play when album releases are anyone's guess. They use their label connections and instincts to keep them ahead of the game and ready to pivot and lockdown the artist with the next big release.",
      "\u201cWe try to really be as genre agnostic and diverse as possible,\u201d said Kirdis Postelle, global head of content and artist marketing at Amazon Music. She works with Andrew Sexton, who handles booking for \u201cAML.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur team, along with myself, are active in conversations about this program,\u201d said Sexton, who is considered a label relations guru. Some of the selling points to attract artists have been to capitalize off the NFL's huge viewership, promote their project and perform with top-notch production.",
      "\u201cWe're very active,\" he said. \"We're always in communications with artist's teams and people are reaching out to us too. ... We're in constant conversations with the industry.\"",
      "Following a high-stakes \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d matchup is plenty of pressure. But pulling off a live major concert after a big NFL showdown? That\u2019s next-level intensity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the challenge which is fungible start time,\u201d said Ed Walker, the head of video studios at Amazon Music.

      "After the game wraps, there\u2019s an hour preshow on Twitch and a top-of-show segment that takes audiences into the artist\u2019s world. The hope is to create a \u201ccloser connection\u201d before their performance, introducing more insight into the artist\u2019s project. There are sweepstakes and competitions to maintain intrigue.",
      "\u201cWe immerse them into what they are about to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a moving target. You have a very large audience watching football, and then we have direct communications to the control room broadcasting that and they are giving us real time updates.\u201d",
      "Walker admits it\u2019s a tough balancing act, keeping the football audience engaged while also entertaining \u201cAML\u201d viewers before the show kicks off.",
      "\u201cWe got to meet in the middle, entertain them all, give them context and start the show,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile all that\u2019s happening, we have to make sure the artist is on the stage and hits the cue on time.\u201d",
      "While artists are rehearsing, Postelle wants to make sure they\u2019re comfortable and don't leave. That led to the idea of an artist experience with food, games, drinks and privacy.",
      "\u201cWe do that to make artists feel good about spending so much time here,\u201d Postelle said. \u201cThe last thing you want is for somebody to be like \u2018I\u2019m going back to the hotel to take a shower\u2019 and they fall asleep. Then we\u2019ll have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Each week, select customers in the Los Angeles area are invited to purchase $15 tickets for that week's performance during an exclusive superfan presale or general onsale.

      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled in a five-page order following a bail hearing last week. At the hearing, lawyers for the hip-hop mogul argued that a $50 million bail package they proposed would be sufficient to ensure Combs doesn\u2019t flee and doesn\u2019t try to intimidate prospective trial witnesses.",
      "Two other judges previously had agreed with prosecutors that the Bad Boy Records founder was a danger to the community if he is not behind bars. Subramanian concurred.",
      "\u201cThere is compelling evidence of Combs's propensity for violence,\u201d Subramanian wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the decision. Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for prosecutors, declined comment.",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees. An indictment alleges that he silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",
      "A federal appeals court judge last month denied Combs\u2019 immediate release while a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan considers his bail request. That appeal was put on hold while Subramanian, newly appointed to the case after an earlier judge stepped aside, considered the bail request for the first time.",
      "Subramanian said he took a fresh look at all the bail arguments and the evidence supporting them to make his decision.",
      "Prosecutors have insisted that no bail conditions would be sufficient to protect the public and prevent the \u201cI'll Be Missing You\u201d singer from fleeing.",
      "They say that even in a federal lockup in Brooklyn, Combs has orchestrated social media campaigns designed to influence prospective jurors and tried to publicly leak materials he thinks can help his case. They say he also has contacted potential witnesses through third parties.",
      "Lawyers for Combs say any alleged sexual abuse described in the indictment occurred during consensual relations between adults and that new evidence refutes allegations that Combs used his \u201cpower and prestige\u201d to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers known as \u201cFreak Offs.\u201d",
      "Subramanian said evidence shows Combs to be a \u201cserious risk of witness tampering,\u201d particularly after he communicated over the summer with a grand jury witness and deleted some of his texts with the witness.",
      "The judge also cited evidence showing that Combs violated Bureau of Prisons regulations during pretrial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn when he paid other inmates to use their phone code numbers so he could make calls to individuals who were not on his approved contact list.",
      "He said there was also evidence that he told family members and defense counsel to add other people to three-way calls so their communications would be more difficult to trace and that he made efforts to influence his trial's jury pool or to reach potential witnesses.",
      "Subramanian said his \u201cwillingness to skirt\u201d jailhouse rules to conceal communications was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that any conditions of release would not prevent similar behavior.",
      "The judge said defense claims that Combs stopped using one particular phone technique criticized by prosecutors was belied by the fact that Combs apparently used it again on Sunday, two days after his bail hearing last week.",
      "Even a bail proposal that would include the strictest form of home confinement seemed insufficient, the judge said.",
      "\u201cGiven the nature of the allegations in this case and the information provided by the government, the Court doubts the sufficiency of any conditions that place trust in Combs and individuals in his employ \u2014 like a private security detail \u2014 to follow those conditions,\u201d Subramanian wrote."

      "NEW YORK -- The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade marched, soared and roared into its second century on Thursday despite a drenching rain and a brief disruption from pro-Palestinian demonstrators.",
      "New York City police said they arrested 21 people after protesters jumped barricades and sat down on the parade route with Palestinian flags and a \u201cDon't Celebrate Genocide\u201d banner.

      "People protesting Israel's war in Gaza also interrupted last year\u2019s parade.",
      "Thanks to the wet weather, ponchos and umbrellas were part of the festivities, along with the usual giant balloons, floats and star-studded performances.",
      "The latest edition of the annual holiday tradition featured new Spider-Man and Minnie Mouse balloons, zoo and pasta-themed floats, an ode to Big Apple coffee and bagels, performances from Jennifer Hudson, Idina Menzel and Kylie Minogue, and more.",
      "The lineup was a far cry from the parade\u2019s initial incarnation 100 years ago, which featured floats showing scenes from Mother Goose, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, Miss Muffet and the Spider, and other fairy tales.",
      "Some things remained the same, though. As in 1924, there were plenty of marching bands and lots of clowns, followed by the grand finale of Santa Claus ushering in the holiday season.",
      "This year's parade featured 17 giant, helium-filled character balloons, 22 floats, 15 novelty and heritage inflatables, 11 marching bands from as far away as Texas and South Dakota, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups, award-winning singers and actors, and the WNBA champion New York Liberty.",
      "Other highlights included reality TV star Ariana Madix, hip-hop\u2019s T-Pain, country duo Dan + Shay, The War and Treaty, The Temptations, Jimmy Fallon & The Roots, Broadway veteran Lea Salonga, and \u201cGlow\u201d actor and Macy's spokesperson Alison Brie.",

      "\u201cThe work that we do, the opportunity to impact millions of people and bring a bit of joy for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning, is what motivates us every day,\u201d said Will Coss, Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade executive producer.",
      "The parade route stretched 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side to Macy\u2019s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which served as a performance backdrop.",
      "NBC\u2019s Al Roker walked part of the route before joining co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb outside the store for the remainder of the live TV coverage. \"Wicked\" film star Cynthia Erivo presented the retiring Kotb with flowers to commemorate what could be her last parade broadcast.",
      "The rain didn't stop anything \u2014 the parade has only been canceled three times, from 1942 to 1944 during World War II \u2014 but organizers monitored wind speeds to make sure the big balloons were safe to fly.",
      "Temperatures hovered near 50 degrees F (10 degrees C), with rain throughout the morning and winds around 10 mph (16 kph), well within the acceptable range for letting Snoopy, Bluey and their friends soar. City law prohibits Macy\u2019s from flying full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 23 mph (37 kph) or wind gusts are over 35 mph (56 kph)."

      "The culture of the humble \u201cW\u00fcrstelstand\u201d became this week one of the latest additions to the national list of intangible cultural heritage, overseen by the Austrian UNESCO Commission. It joins the Austrian capital's distinctive wine taverns, or \u201cHeurigen,\u201d which have been listed since 2019, and the city's famous coffee house culture, which was honored in 2011.",

      "\u201cOriginally it was just a bucket with hot water in which the sausages used to swim,\" he said. They were sold from \"small carriages drawn by dogs and bigger ones drawn by horses, later by a VW bus or a tractor to their spot.\u201d",
      "The tradition goes back to the pre-World War I days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when former soldiers set up mobile cookshops to make a living. The city\u2019s longest-lived stall in a fixed location, W\u00fcrstelstand Leo, has been serving up sausages since 1928. The stands developed into a bigger institution after wider-ranging permission for fixed stalls was granted in 1969.",
      "It was then that the griddle was introduced and the cheesy K\u00e4sekrainer invented, Bitzinger said. \"Today that\u2019s already a classic.\u201d",
      "The UNESCO designation \u201chonors the tradition, the hospitality and the diversity of our city,\u201d Mayor Michael Ludwig said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis title is a recognition for all those Viennese who, with their warmth and their charm, make the sausage stands more than just a snack place \u2014 a meeting place where joie de vivre and culture come together.\u201d",
      "Bitzinger said that \u201cwe have been fighting a long time for this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe special thing about it is that it\u2019s a form of gastronomy everybody can afford,\" he said. \"Here the general director and, during the opera ball, a celebrity stands next to a worker and the street sweeper who just finished cleaning the street. That unites people.\u201d",

We hold it in our chest. We breathe from a different place when we\u2019re nervous or we\u2019re sad.",
      "\u201cThe first few weeks were the hardest because my body had to open and I had to breathe again,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd that was a discovery of how much I wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria,\u201d which Netflix released in theaters Wednesday before it begins streaming on Dec. 11, Jolie gives, if not the performance of her career, then certainly of her last decade. Beginning with 2010\u2019s \u201cIn the Land of Blood and Honey,\u201d Jolie has spent recent years directing films while prioritizing raising her six children.",
      "\u201cSo my choices for quite a few years were whatever was smart financially and short. I worked very little the last eight years,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cAnd I was kind of drained. I couldn\u2019t for a while.\u201d",
      "But her youngest kids are now 16. And for the first time in years, Jolie is back in the spotlight, in full movie-star mode. Her commanding performance in \u201cMaria\u201d seems assured of bringing Jolie her third Oscar nomination. (She won supporting actress in 2000 for \u201cGirl, Interrupted.\u201d) For an actress whose filmography might lack a signature movie, \u201cMaria\u201d may be Jolie's defining role.",
      "Jolie's oldest children, Maddox and Pax, worked on the set of the film. There, they saw a version of their mother they hadn't seen before.",
      "\u201cThey had certainly seen me sad in my life. But I don\u2019t cry in front of my children like that,\u201d Jolie says of the emotion Callas dredged up in her. \u201cThat was a moment in realizing they were going to be with me, side by side, in this process of really understanding the depth of some of the pain I carry.\u201d",
      "Jolie, who met a reporter earlier this fall at the Carlyle Hotel, didn't speak in any detail of that pain. But it was hard not to sense some it had to do with her lengthy and ongoing divorce from Brad Pitt, with whom she had six children.",
      "Just prior to meeting, a judge allowed Pitt\u2019s remaining claim against Jolie, over the French winery Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, to proceed. On Monday, a judge ruled that Pitt must disclose documents Jolie\u2019s legal team have sought that they allege include \u201ccommunications concerning abuse.\u201d Pitt has denied ever being abusive.",
      "The result of the U.S. presidential election was also just days old, though Jolie \u2014 special envoy for the United Nations Refugee Agency from 2012 to 2022 \u2013 wasn\u2019t inclined to talk politics. Asked about Donald Trump\u2019s win, she responded, \u201cGlobal storytelling is essential,\u201d before adding: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing on. Listening. Listening to the voices of people in my country and around the world.\u201d",
      "Balancing such things \u2014 reports concerning her private life, questions that accompany someone of her fame \u2014 is a big reason why Jolie is so suited to the part of Callas. The film takes place during the American-born soprano\u2019s final days. (She died of a heart attack at 53 in 1977.) Spending much of her time in her grand Paris apartment, Callas hasn\u2019t sung publicly in years; she\u2019s lost her voice. Imprisoned by the myth she\u2019s created, Callas is redefining herself and her voice. An instructor tells her he wants to hear \u201cCallas, not Maria.\" The movie, of course, is more concerned with Maria.",
      "It\u2019s Larrain\u2019s third portrait of 20th century female icon, following \u201cJackie\u201d (with Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy) and \u201cSpencer\u201d (with Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana). As Callas, Jolie is wonderfully regal \u2014 a self-possessed diva who deliciously, in lines penned by screenwriter Steven Knight, spouts lines like: \u201cI took liberties all my life and the world took liberties with me.\u201d",
      "Asked if she identified with that line, Jolie answered, \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Then she took a long pause.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure people will read a lot into this and there\u2019s probably a lot I could say but don\u2019t want to feed into,\u201d Jolie eventually continues. \u201cI know she was a public person because she loved her work. And I\u2019m a public person because I love my work, not because I like being public. I think some people are more comfortable with a public life, and I\u2019ve never been fully comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "When Larra\u00edn first approached Jolie about the role, he screened \u201cSpencer\u201d for her. That film, like \u201cJackie\u201d and \u201cMaria,\u201d eschews a biopic approach to instead intimately focus on a specific moment of crisis. Larra\u00edn was convinced Jolie was meant for the role.",
      "\u201cI felt she could have that magnetism,\u201d Larra\u00edn says. \u201cThe enigmatic diva that\u2019s come to a point in her life where she has to take control of her life again. But the weight of her experience, of her music, of her singing, everything, is on her back. And she carries that. It\u2019s someone who\u2019s already loaded with a life that\u2019s been intense.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a loneliness that we both share,\u201d Jolie says. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I think people can be alone and lonely sometimes, and that can be part of who they are.\u201d",
      "Larra\u00edn, the Chilean filmmaker, grew up in Santiago going to the opera, and he has long yearned to bring its full power and majesty to a movie. In Callas, he heard something that transfixed him.",
      "\u201cI hear something near perfection, but at the same time, it\u2019s something that\u2019s about to be destroyed,\u201d Larra\u00edn says. \u201cSo it\u2019s as fragile and as strong as possible. It lives in both extremes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so moving. I hear a voice that\u2019s about to be broken, but it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In Callas\u2019 less perfect moments singing in the film, Larra\u00edn fuses archival recordings of Callas with Jolie\u2019s own voice. Some mix of the two runs throughout \u201cMaria.\u201d \u201cEarly in the process,\u201d Jolie says, \u201cI discovered that you can\u2019t fake-sing opera.\u201d",
      "Jolie has said she never sang before, not even karaoke. But the experience has left her with a newfound appreciation of opera and its healing properties.",
      "\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s something you lean into as you get older,\u201d Jolie says. \u201cMaybe your depth of pain is bigger, your depth of loss is bigger, and that sound in opera meets that, the enormity of it.\u201d",
      "If Larra\u00edn\u2019s approach to \u201cMaria\u201d is predicated on an unknowingness, he's inclined to say something similar about his star.",
      "\u201cBecause of media and social media, some people might think that they know a lot about Angelina,\u201d he says. \u201cMaria, I read nine biographies of her. I saw everything. I read every interview. I made this movie. But I don\u2019t think I would be capable of telling you who she was us. So if there\u2019s an element in common, it\u2019s that. They carry an enormous amount of mystery. Even if you think that you know them, you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Whether \u201cMaria\u201d means more acting in the future for Jolie, she's not sure. \u201cThere's not a clear map,\u201d she says. Besides, Jolie isn't quite ready to shake Callas.",
      "\u201cWhen you play a real person, you feel at some point that they become your friend,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s still a little personal. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ll be at a premiere or I\u2019ll walk into a room and someone will start blaring her music for fun, but I have this crazy internal sense memory of dropping to my knees and crying.\u201d"

      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "BOSTON -- A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time.",
      "Other locations have weighed similar \u201cgenerational tobacco bans,\u201d which phase out the use of tobacco products based not just on a person's age but on birth year.",
      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",
      "Other Massachusetts cities and towns already have approved similar tobacco bans, including Malden, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Jason Lewis, one of the backers of the statewide proposal, said the bill would \"save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth,\" he said.",
      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",
      "In 2022, 10.4% of adults in Massachusetts reported smoking cigarettes, according to the state Department of Public Health.",
      "Some California lawmakers have pushed to ban all tobacco sales, filing legislation last year to make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other products to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2007.",
      "In 2022, New Zealand became the first nation to pass a law intended to impose a lifetime ban on young people buying cigarettes by mandating that tobacco can\u2019t ever be sold to anybody born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. The law was later axed.",
      "In the U.K., Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed raising the legal age that people in England can buy cigarettes by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The proposal failed to win approval earlier this year."

      "MILWAUKEE -- The Aurora Health Care Mobile Medical Clinic team waited patiently at a table in the main hallway of the Milwaukee Public Library\u2019s sprawling downtown branch, a blood pressure cuff and mental health questionnaire at the ready as they called out to patrons who paused: \u201cDo you have any questions about your health?\u201d",
      "On this Tuesday afternoon, one man did. His joints were bothering him, he told Carolyn McCarthy, the team\u2019s nurse practitioner. And he knew his bones need calcium to stay strong, so he stopped taking his blood pressure medication, a calcium channel blocker.",
      "McCarthy talked with him at length in simple and specific terms about how the medication worked on his cells, why it was important to take and how it doesn\u2019t affect calcium storage in his bones.",
      "\u201cHopefully, he walked away a little bit more informed,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "The mobile clinic is one of several health programs offered by libraries around across the U.S. \u2014 from tiny rural town libraries to large urban systems. They offer fitness classes, food pantries, cooking classes, conversations about loneliness and mental health, and even blood pressure monitors that can be checked out just like books.",
      "The public health programs leverage libraries' reputation as sources of reliable information and their ability to reach people beyond formal health care settings. No money, insurance, language skills or ID required, no limits on age. All are welcome.",
      "Libraries are \u201cthe last true public institution,\u201d said Jaime Placht, a health and well-being specialist at the Kansas City Public Library system in Kansas City, Missouri. The system has a full-time social work team. \u201cThe library is a public health space.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Public Library, along with Milwaukee and several others, is part of the American Heart Association's Libraries with Heart program. Several Kansas City branches have blood pressure stations \u2014 which Placht said have been used 13,000 times \u2014 as well as a take-home blood pressure kits that have been checked out nearly 100 times. The program started there about a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe have patrons that say, \u2018Because I used the blood pressure monitor at the library, I went and saw my physician for the first time in a long time,\u2019\u201d Placht said.",
      "There is no local public health office in Jarrell, Texas, a small town between Austin and Waco. But there is a nonprofit library that can connect patrons to mental health help. It's one of nine rural libraries in central Texas that receives funding from the St. David\u2019s Foundation, the philanthropic arm of one of the state\u2019s largest health systems.",
      "Jarrell Community Library and Resource Center is a place for brave conversations. When a senior card game group turned to a discussion of the best crematorium in town, the library brought in local experts to teach about end-of-life planning, library director Susan Gregurek said. Last year, seven women came to the library for information on how to file restraining orders against their husbands.",
      "\u201cThis is mental health, but it\u2019s obviously larger than mental health,\" Gregurek said.",
      "The public library in Smithville, Texas, which also gets money from the Libraries for Health program, stocks boxes of surplus food from area farmers and built out programs that help teens, older adults and parents address isolation. The library\u2019s peer support specialist has gone from working with four to five people a month to nearly 60 in the community southeast of Austin.",
      "St. David's Foundation has invested more than $3 million in the program over three years, which Smithville library director Judy Bergeron said is key when she hears comments like, \u201cWhy are we funding the library so much? Nobody reads anymore.\u201d",
      "A year and a half into being in Milwaukee's libraries, mobile health clinic reaches eight patrons on average per visit. They've had some people come back to say they went to the hospital and got a life-saving treatment, McCarthy said. They\u2019ve also had patients who did not seek help and later died.",
      "\u201cWhat we do is a Band-Aid on a broken (health care) system,\u201d McCarthy said of the clinic.",
      "Another library effort in Milwaukee teaches kids about healthy nutrition habits at the Mitchell Street branch \u2014 a weekly after-school program run by chef Sharrie Agee since 2022.",
      "\u201cCertain areas of Milwaukee don\u2019t have the same opportunities to (access) healthy ingredients, healthy sources of food, the knowledge behind how to use those ingredients,\u201d said Agee, whose class learns how to make snacks from different continents.",

      "Cucumbers shipped to the U.S. and Canada \u2014 and organic eggs sold in 25 Costco stores in five southern U.S. states \u2014 have been recalled because of potential salmonella contamination",
      "Cucumbers shipped to the U.S. and Canada, and organic eggs sold in 25 Costco stores in five southern U.S. states, were recalled this week for potential salmonella contamination.",
      "The cucumber outbreak sickened 68 people, including 18 who were hospitalized, in 19 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. No one has died. Produce grown in Sonora, Mexico, by Agrotato S.A. may be the culprit, the agency said.",
      "A recall announced Thursday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was tied to the outbreak. SunFed Produce, based in Arizona, recalled cucumbers sold between Oct. 12 and Nov. 26, the FDA said.",
      "The recall happened after SunFed was told by the FDA that there were associated illnesses reported between Oct. 12 and Nov. 15. People who bought cucumbers during the window should check with the store where they purchased them to see if the produce is part of the recall.",
      "The egg recall involved nearly 11,000 cartons of 24-count organic eggs sold under Costco's Kirkland Signature brand that landed on shelves in Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee starting Nov. 22, according to the company\u2019s announcement posted Wednesday on the FDA website.",
      "No illnesses were immediately reported. Handsome Brook Farms said the cartons included eggs that were \u201cnot intended for retail distribution.\" Shoppers should check to see whether their egg cartons have Julian code 327 printed on the side and have a use-by date of Jan. 5, 2025. If the eggs are included in the recall, throw them out or take them back to the store for a refund.",
      "Customers who had either of the recalled food products should wash items and surfaces that may have been in contact with the foods using hot, soapy water or a dishwasher.",
      "Salmonella can cause symptoms that begin six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria and include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover without treatment within a week, but young children, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill.",
      "Earlier this summer, a separate salmonella outbreak in cucumbers sickened 450 people in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Advocates for transgender rights are turning to a conservative-dominated Supreme Court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "The justices on Wednesday are taking up the issue of gender-affirming care for transgender minors, which has been banned by Tennessee and 25 other Republican-led states.",
      "The fight over whether transgender adolescents can access puberty blockers and hormonal treatments is part of a broader effort to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.",
      "Trump backed a national ban on such care as part of his 2024 campaign in which he demeaned and mocked transgender people.",
      "In its waning days, the Biden administration, along with families of transgender adolescents, will appeal to the justices to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high, of course, for transgender adolescents, but also for the parents who are watching their children suffer, who are just trying to do right by their kids,\u201d Chase Strangio, who represents the families at the Supreme Court, said in an interview. Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, will be the first openly transgender person to argue before the high court.",
      "A lawyer for Tennessee will argue that the \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures\u201d are risky and unproven and that it\u2019s the state\u2019s role to protect children.",
      "Trump nominated three justices in his first term who pushed the court in a more conservative direction that included the decision in 2022 overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which had protected abortion rights for nearly 50 years.",
      "Yet one of Trump's appointees, Justice Neil Gorsuch, also authored a ruling in 2020 that protected LGBTQ people from discrimination in the workplace under federal civil rights law.",
      "The administration and transgender families both rely on that decision to bolster their arguments.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, it's possible the new administration could weigh in on the case, which is not expected to be decided until the spring.",
      "There are about 300,000 people between age 13 and 17, and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The Williams Institute is a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics to inform laws and public policy decisions.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee, and those laws mostly are in effect, despite legal challenges. The Tennessee case is the first time the nation\u2019s top court will consider the constitutionality of the bans.",
      "Sivan Kotler-Berkowitz, a 20-year-old college student in Massachusetts who is transgender, said his life would have been very different if he were just a few years younger and living in one of the states.",
      "\u201cThese bans are denying people the opportunity to live and excel,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere are thousands of transgender youth across the country that are thriving just like me because we\u2019ve had the love and understanding of our families and because we\u2019ve had access to proper care.\u201d",
      "The bans in Tennessee and elsewhere have put families in the position of deciding whether to travel for ongoing health care, go without or wait until their children turn 18.",
      "Erin Friday, a leader of Our Duty, an international group that supports the bans on gender-affirming care for minors, said the case is going to be as important as Roe v. Wade. She said upholding the Tennessee law would bolster the cases for the laws restricting sports participation and bathroom use.",
      "Among the arguments advanced by defenders of the state laws is that many children who initially say they are transgender eventually change their mind. Friday said her daughter was 11 when she said she was transgender, which Friday attributed to the child having been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d at school. But after receiving psychiatric treatment, her daughter changed her mind, Friday said. If laws like Tennessee\u2019s are struck down, \u201cmore children would be irreversibly harmed and live a life of deep regret,\u201d Friday said in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Guidelines from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health that were revised in 2022 say evidence of regret about transitioning is scant but also that patients should be told about the possibility during psychological counseling.",
      "Some doctors who work with transgender minors said a state should not come between doctors, their patients and parents. \u201cFrom a medical standpoint, I think it\u2019s really frightening and dangerous to think that legislators could pass a law that basically judges or controls what people could do with a medication based on a diagnosis,\u201d Dr. Susan Lacy of Memphis, Tennessee, who joined with the families in suing the state, said in an interview.",
      "Michelle Quist Ryder, CEO of the American Psychological Foundation, said the laws, if left in place, are damaging for the physical and mental health of transgender people and their supporters. Gender dysphoria \u2014 the unease a person may have when their assigned sex and gender identity don\u2019t match \u2014 has been linked to depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "\u201cThe more we lessen the sense of safety in this community, trans youth will look out and say, \u2018Who else is going to come after me?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "There are prominent names in some of the 83 briefs, an unusually high number, filed on both sides of the case. Actors Elliot Page and Nicole Maines, and Sarah McBride of Delaware, who in November became the first openly transgender person to win election to Congress, have joined more than five dozen people in urging the court to strike down the Tennessee law.",
      "Tennis legend Martina Navratilova and Olympic swimming gold medalists Donna de Varona and Summer Sanders are among 135 athletes, coaches, officials and parents who want the justices to uphold the ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",

    "story": [
      "British lawmakers have given initial approval to a bill that would help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales",
      "LONDON -- British lawmakers gave initial approval on Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales, following an impassioned debate that saw people sharing personal stories of loss and suffering.",
      "Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote.",
      "Friday's vote came after hours of debate \u2014 emotional at times \u2014 that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,\u201d the bill\u2019s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber.",
      "Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable.",
      "Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative.",
      "The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards.",
      "They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland.",
      "Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance.",
      "Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a \u201cstate suicide service.\" He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives.",
      "Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future.",
      "\u201cI still think we can stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide.",
      "The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties.",
      "Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the \u201cwonderful\u201d outcome and said it will give people an \u201cequal choice.\u201d",
      "When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents.",
      "Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament on a cold but bright day as the debate continued for nearly five hours.",
      "Opponents held signs saying, \u201cKill the bill, not the ill,\u201d and, referring to the National Health Service, \u201cNHS It's cradle to grave. Not 'til old, inconvenient or expensive!\u201d",
      "The group Dignity in Dying, many wearing pink winter hats, led supporters as they clutched signs saying \u201cGiving me choice over my death,\u201d and \u201cYou can't cure death. Please make it fear free.\u201d",
      "Backers of the measure erupted in cheers when the result was announced and hugged each other.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relief, it\u2019s history, finally we are getting towards having a society that shows love and compassion above the need to just keep people alive,\" said Joshua Cook, 33, who has Huntington\u2019s disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Missouri's Republican attorney general says he still considers it illegal to provide abortions after fetal viability, despite a newly approved state abortion rights amendment",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Missouri's Republican attorney general has pledged to enforce some laws restricting abortion despite a new constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "In an opinion requested by incoming GOP governor Mike Kehoe, Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote that his office will continue enforcing a ban on abortion after fetal viability.",
      "There is an exception carved out in the amendment for cases in which a health care provider deems an abortion necessary to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder the express terms of the amendment, the government may still protect innocent life after viability,\u201d Bailey wrote. \u201cThe statutes thus remain generally enforceable after viability.\u201d",
      "Bailey said his office also will continue to honor a Missouri law requiring parental permission for minors to receive abortions.",
      "Bailey's opinion comes after voters approved a ballot measure this month that enshrines abortion rights in the state constitution while allowing lawmakers to restrict or ban it after fetal viability.",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "The measure\u2019s passage was one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates this past election, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri sued the day after the election to invalidate the state\u2019s abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care. That lawsuit is still pending.",
      "Allowing restrictions on abortions after viability was a sticking point for some abortion rights supporters in Missouri.",
      "Advocates had worried that failing to include such limits would sink their chances of passing abortion protections. But others cautioned against giving the Republican-controlled Legislature the power to enact regulations that could effectively end access."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a critic of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates, to lead the National Institutes of Health, the nation's leading medical research agency.",
      "Trump, in a statement Tuesday evening, said Bhattacharya, a 56-year-old physician and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation\u2019s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cTogether, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America\u2019s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,\" he wrote.",
      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and during the first Trump administration \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Jim O\u2019Neill, a former HHS official and Silicon Valley investor, will serve as deputy secretary of the sprawling agency. Trump said O\u2019Neill \u201cwill oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\u201d the president-elect announced.",
      "O\u2019Neill is a longtime associate of billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, one of Trump's leading backers from the tech industry. Thiel and O'Neill co-founded Mithril Capital Management, a venture fund that invests in medical technology and other startup companies. O\u2019Neill previously served in HHS under George W. Bush and was considered to head the Food and Drug Administration during Trump's first term. He has expressed disdain for federal regulation, including FDA's approach to regulating emerging drugs and other technologies.",
      "O\u2019Neill also worked on some of Thiel\u2019s signature projects, often reflecting his libertarian philosophy.",
      "He served on the board of a Thiel-funded nonprofit that aimed to develop man-made islands that would float outside U.S. territory, allowing them to experiment with new forms of government. He also helped form and run the Thiel Fellowship, which awards $100,000 to young entrepreneurs who want to leave school to pursue a business or scientific venture.",
      "O\u2019Neill is the only one of Trump\u2019s health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the HHS bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for FDA commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",
      "Bhattacharya, who faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was also a plaintiff in Murthy v. Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in that case.",
      "After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he invited Bhattacharya to the company's headquarters to learn more about how his views had been restricted on the platform, which Musk renamed X. More recently, Bhattacharya has posted on X about scientists leaving the site and joining the alternative site Bluesky, mocking Bluesky as \"their own little echo chamber.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya has argued that vaccine mandates that barred unvaccinated people from activities and workplaces undermined Americans' trust in the public health system.",
      "He is a former research fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economist at the RAND Corporation.",
      "The National Institutes of Health falls under HHS, which Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee. The NIH's $48 billion budget funds medical research on vaccines, cancer and other diseases through competitive grants to researchers at institutions across the nation. The agency also conducts its own research with thousands of scientists working at NIH labs in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Among advances that were supported by NIH money are a medication for opioid addiction, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, many new cancer drugs and the speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "But workplace morale and productivity can take a hit when ideological differences are left to fester, affecting teamwork and feelings of mutual respect. Finding a safe space to process emotions while remaining civil can be a delicate balancing act.",
      "While talking politics with colleagues can be fortifying, the opposite also can be true when we disagree. Being exposed to strongly held beliefs that run counter to one\u2019s own values can lead to people feeling mistreated or unsafe. This month's U.S. presidential election heightened those tensions.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of anxiety during this election, and in times of anxiety you need to create psychological safety in people,\u201d said Ron Gutman, an adjunct professor of leadership at Stanford University and the co-founder and co-CEO of health technology company Intrivo. \u201cYou need to create trust in people, to bring back the trust in each other.\u201d",
      "Here are some tips from business leaders, psychologists and communication experts on how to navigate political conflicts in the workplace.",
      "To cultivate a more peaceful working environment, executives, managers and employees can practice humility. That means seeing ourselves as equal and not superior to our colleagues and subordinates, and recognizing that no one has all the right answers.",
      "When we listen to others thoughtfully and relinquish a reflexive belief in our own infallibility, it allows us to remain open to new ideas and perspectives, said Inclusivv CEO Jenn Graham, whose organization creates structured dialogues around social and political issues for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWe can say something like, \u2018I haven\u2019t heard of that or thought of that before. Thank you for sharing,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd that simple act of \u2018thank you for sharing,\u2019 with gratitude and humility combined, creates a reciprocity for that brave space, for that psychological safety. And that\u2019s what we need to foster more than ever.\u201d",
      "To cultivate a humble mindset, think about why you might be wrong, and consider that the opposite of what you believe might be true, said Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor at Augusta University in Georgia. \u201cWe are really good at seeking out information that supports our beliefs, and then we scrutinize evidence that challenges our beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you\u2019re hearing and feeling.",
      "For example, when a comedian opened a campaign rally for President-elect Donald Trump last month by referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d many people were deeply upset, said psychologist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering youth and young adults of color and people who face sexism and homophobia.",
      "The same was true after Black teenagers and adults received text messages this month telling them they were \u201cselected to pick cotton,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sadness around, why isn\u2019t anybody publicly telling these people, 'You can\u2019t say these things about people who come from my community?\u2019\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "People feel like their lives are on the line, and are asking, \u201cWhere do I go with this struggle that I\u2019m having? Because people who look like me nationally, we all feel like we\u2019re under attack,\u201d she said.",
      "Breland-Noble encourages employees who feel marginalized by political discourse to identify colleagues to confide in, to check workplace policies for any rules on unacceptable speech and behavior, and to consider speaking with a trusted supervisor about what they\u2019re experiencing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot that we can learn from how people have over time managed having a marginalized identity and being in the workplace because you have a plethora of people around you who are dealing with this stuff literally every day,\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "Also check your employer\u2019s social media policy. In many states, workers can be fired for posting political beliefs online, said Brad Kelley, a shareholder who represents employers at the law firm Littler.",
      "When attempting to resolve discord, one way to foster a peaceful resolution is to seek common ground.",
      "In the structured conversations she leads, Graham encourages participants to begin by listening to and acknowledging what the other person is saying. Repeat it back. Honor their emotions. Then you can share your perspective, and in the process you may find similarities, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for common ground, you\u2019re ideally looking for a shared value,\" Graham said. It could be as simple as recognizing \u201cwe both have a need for and a desire for (fill in the) blank.\u201d",
      "Most people want a happier, healthier, more prosperous country, but the disagreement often lies in how to best get there, Telkamp said. Acknowledging shared goals can help de-escalate tension.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and the right are disliking, distrusting, and generally they think people on the other side are unintelligent and immoral,\u201d Telkamp said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we can kind of get off the ledge a little bit and come back to a better understanding of each other.\u201d",
      "One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what\u2019s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of trust within an organization.",
      "Every Friday at Intrivo, the staff gathers for an hour and one person presents on a topic they\u2019re passionate about. It could be a hobby, an idea, a family experience or a skill. Political topics are fine as long as no one is putting anyone down, he said.",
      "\u201cIt can be super technical or super silly,\u201d Gutman said. The conversations build trust, and a sense of safety and community, he said.",
      "In circumstances where a discussion is getting heated, sometimes the best way to handle it is to remove ourselves from the conflict or to keep our views to ourselves.",
      "Leaders may want to consider abstaining from sharing their political views, which may alienate some workers, Telkamp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not about silencing your beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping the workplace focused on the work.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- A doctor who was arrested in Berlin in August is now suspected of killing eight patients and in some cases trying to cover up the evidence by setting fires, investigators said Thursday.",
      "The unidentified doctor, who was part of a nursing service's palliative care team, was suspected at the time of his arrest of killing four elderly patients in June and July and then attempting with mixed success to set fires at their apartments.",
      "Police and prosecutors said Thursday that additional cases surfaced when they examined patients' files and carried out forensic examinations of suspected victims, two of whom were exhumed.",
      "In the earliest case, he is a suspected of administering a lethal mixture of medicines to a 70-year-old man in January. In a similar case in early April, the alleged victim was a 61-year-old woman. A few weeks later, he is alleged to have killed an 83-year-old man in his room at a Berlin hospice with a mixture of medicines.",
      "In the fourth new case, in June, he is alleged to have killed a 70-year-old woman at her apartment and then set a fire. Firefighters were able to prevent the blaze spreading to the rest of the building.",
      "The 40-year-old doctor was originally arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, arson and attempted arson. Prosecutors said they are now treating the cases as murder because the suspect appears to have had no motive other than killing the patients.",
      "The suspect's name hasn't been released, in keeping with German privacy rules. Prosecutors say he hasn't yet responded to the allegations."

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's attorney general will appeal a ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's laws restricting abortion.",
      "A county judge in October determined that last year\u2019s voter-approved amendment enshrining reproductive rights effectively made the so-called heartbeat law unconstitutional. The law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 had been paused pending the challenge.",
      "Republican Attorney General Dave Yost on Friday filed a notice of appeal with the court. His office said there are provisions in the law that aren't addressed in the constitutional amendment.",
      "\u201cIt is up to the courts to determine how conflicts between those two documents are resolved,\" said Bethany McCorkle, a spokesperson for Yost.",
      "Yost acknowledged in earlier court filings that the amendment rendered the Ohio ban unconstitutional, but sought to maintain other elements of the 2019 law, including certain notification and reporting provisions.",
      "Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins said in his ruling that retaining those provisions would have subjected doctors who perform abortions to felony criminal charges, fines, license suspensions or revocations, and civil claims of wrongful death \u2014 and required patients to make two in-person visits to their provider, wait 24 hours for the procedure and have their abortion recorded and reported."

      "The man\u2019s attorneys celebrated Monday\u2019s verdict, saying they are hopeful it will prevent other men from falling victim to a scheme that involved fraud and what they described as dangerous penile injections. They said the punitive and compensatory damages total the largest amount to ever be awarded by a jury in a medical malpractice case in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt's a national record setting case and it's righteous because I don't think there's any place for licensed professionals to be defrauding patients for money. That is a very egregious breach of their fiduciary duty,\" said Lori Bencoe, one of the lawyers who represented the plaintiff. \"That's breach of trust and anytime someone is wearing a white coat, they shouldn't be allowed to do that.\u201d",
      "The award follows a trial held in Albuquerque earlier this month that centered on allegations outlined in a lawsuit filed by the man's attorneys in 2020. NuMale Medical Center and company officials were named as defendants.",
      "According to the complaint, the man was 66 when he visited the clinic in 2017 in search of treatment for fatigue and weight loss. The clinic is accused of misdiagnosing him and unnecessarily treating him with \u201cinvasive erectile dysfunction shots\u201d that caused irreversible damage.",
      "Nick Rowley, another attorney who was part of the plaintiff's team, said the out-of-state medical corporation set up a \u201cfraudulent scheme to make millions off of conning old men.\u201d He provided some details in a social media post, saying clinic workers told patients they would have irreversible damage if they didn't agree to injections three times a week.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Vaping is coming before the Supreme Court next week as federal regulators ask the high court to uphold its block on sweet, flavored products following a spike in youth e-cigarette use.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has denied more than a million marketing applications for candy- or fruit-flavored products that appeal to kids, part of a wider crackdown that advocates say helped drive down teen vaping after an \u201cepidemic level\u201d surge in 2019.",

      "Donald Trump's health team picks includes outspoken critics of the medical establishment and COVID-19 health measures",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has assembled a team of medical contrarians and health care critics to fulfill an agenda aimed at remaking how the federal government oversees medicines, health programs and nutrition.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump nominated Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health, tapping an opponent of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates to lead the nation's top medical research agency. He is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who were critics of COVID-19 health measures.",
      "Bhattacharya and the other nominees are expected to play pivotal roles in implementing Robert F. Kennedy Jr's sprawling \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives from U.S. foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs. Trump nominated Kennedy to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH and other federal health agencies.",
      "The new health priorities bear little resemblance to those of Trump\u2019s first term, which focused on cutting regulations for food, drug and agriculture companies.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re hearing a very different tune as we head into this new Trump administration,\u201d said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University\u2019s school of public health. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we all proceed with caution and remember some of the public health losses we saw the first time.\u201d",
      "Trump's nominees don't have experience running large bureaucratic agencies, but they know how to talk about health on TV.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pick Dr. Mehmet Oz hosted a talk show for 13 years and is a well-known wellness and lifestyle influencer. The pick for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Marty Makary, and for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, had been frequent Fox News contributors.",
      "Some of them have ties to Florida like many of Trump's other Cabinet nominees: Dave Weldon, the pick for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, represented the state in Congress for 14 years.",
      "Here's a look at how the nominees may carry out Kennedy's plans to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies, which have an overall $1.7 trillion budget, employ 80,000 scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials:",
      "The National Institutes of Health, with a $48 billion budget, funds medical research through grants to scientists across the nation and conducts its own research.",
      "Bhattacharya, a health economist and physician at Stanford University, was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Kennedy has said he would pause NIH's drug development and infectious disease research and shift its focus to chronic diseases. He also would like to keep NIH funding from researchers with conflicts of interest. In 2017, he said the agency wasn't doing enough research into the role of vaccines in autism \u2014 an idea that has long been debunked.",
      "The Atlanta-based CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.",
      "Kennedy has long attacked vaccines and criticized the CDC, repeatedly alleging corruption at the agency. He said on a 2023 podcast that there is \"no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d and urged people to resist the CDC's guidelines about if and when kids should get vaccinated. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years, and that 100 million of them were infants.",
      "Decades ago, Kennedy found common ground with Weldon, who served in the Army and worked as an internal medicine doctor before he represented a central Florida congressional district from 1995 to 2009.",
      "Starting in the early 2000s, Weldon had a prominent part in a debate about whether there was a relationship between a vaccine preservative called thimerosal and autism. He was a founding member of the Congressional Autism Caucus and tried to ban thimerosal from all vaccines.",
      "Since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated flu vaccine. Meanwhile, study after study found no evidence that thimerosal caused autism.",
      "Weldon's congressional voting record suggests he may go along with Republican efforts to downsize the CDC, including to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses and shooting deaths.",
      "Kennedy has been extremely critical of the FDA, which has 18,000 employees and is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and other medical products, as well as overseeing cosmetics, electronic cigarettes and most foods.",
      "Makary, Trump\u2019s pick to run the FDA, is a professor at Johns Hopkins University, a trained surgeon and a cancer specialist. He is closely aligned with Kennedy on several topics.",
      "Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "Kennedy has suggested he'll clear out \u201centire\u201d FDA departments and also recently threatened to fire FDA employees for \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated products and therapies, including stem cells, raw milk, psychedelics and discredited COVID-era treatments like hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Makary's contrarian views during COVID-19 included questioning the need for COVID-19 vaccine boosters in young kids.",
      "The agency provides health care coverage for more than 160 million people through Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, and also sets Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors and other providers. With a $1.1 trillion budget and more than 6,000 employees, Oz has a massive agency to run if confirmed \u2014 and an agency that Kennedy hasn't talked about much.",
      "While Trump tried to scrap the Affordable Care Act in his first term, Kennedy has not taken aim at it yet.",
      "The Biden administration on Tuesday revealed a new plan to force Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for many Americans who are obese. Kennedy has opposed the idea, saying government-sponsored insurance programs should instead expand coverage of healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "Trump said during his campaign that he would protect Medicare, which provides insurance for older Americans. Oz has endorsed expanding Medicare Advantage \u2014 a privately run version of Medicare that is popular but also a source of widespread fraud.",
      "Kennedy doesn't appear to have said much publicly about what he'd like to see from the surgeon general.",
      "The nation's top doctor has little administrative power but can influence what counts as a public health danger and what to do about it \u2014 suggesting things like warning labels for products and issuing advisories. The current surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, declared gun violence as a public health crisis in June.",
      "Trump's pick, Nesheiwat, is employed as a New York City medical director with CityMD, a group of urgent care facilities. She also has appeared on Fox News and other TV shows, authored a book on the \u201ctransformative power of prayer\u201d in her medical career and endorses a brand of vitamin supplements.",

      "BEIRUT -- Carol Zeghayer gripped her IV as she hurried down the brightly lit hallway of Beirut\u2019s children\u2019s cancer center. The 9-year-old's face brightened when she spotted her playmates from the oncology ward.",
      "Diagnosed with cancer just months before the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel erupted in October 2023, Carol relies on weekly trips to the center in the Lebanese capital for treatment.",
      "But what used to be a 90-minute drive, now takes up to three hours on a mountainous road to skirt the heavy bombardment in south Lebanon, but still not without danger from Israeli airstrikes. The family is just one among many across Lebanon now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just a child. When they strike, she asks me, \u2018Mama, was that far?\u2019\u201d said her mother, Sindus Hamra.",
      "The family lives in Hasbaya, a province in southeastern Lebanon where the rumble of Israeli airstrikes has become part of daily life. Just 15 minutes away from their home, in the front-line town of Khiam, Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters clash amidst relentless bombardments.",
      "On the morning of a recent trip to Beirut for her treatment, the family heard a rocket roar and its deafening impact as they left their home. Israeli airstrikes have also hit vehicles along the Damascus-Beirut highway, which Carol and her mother have to cross.",
      "The bombardment hasn\u2019t let up even as hopes grew in recent days that a ceasefire might soon be agreed.",
      "More than war, Hamra fears that Carol will miss chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cHer situation is very tricky \u2014 her cancer can spread to her head,\u201d Hamra said, her eyes filling with tears. Her daughter, diagnosed first with cancer of the lymph nodes and later leukemia, has completed a third of her treatment, with many months still ahead.",
      "While Carol's family remains in their home, many in Lebanon have been displaced by an intensified Israeli bombardment that began in late September. Tens of thousands fled their homes in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2014 among them were families with children battling cancer.",
      "The Children\u2019s Cancer Center of Lebanon quickly identified each patient\u2019s location to ensure treatments remained uninterrupted, sometimes facilitating them at hospitals closer to the families' new locations, said Zeina El Chami, the center\u2019s fundraising and events executive.",
      "During the first days of the escalation, the center admitted some patients for emergency care and kept them there as it was unsafe to send them home, said Dolly Noun, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.",
      "\u201cThey had no place to go,\u201d she added. \"We\u2019ve had patients getting admitted for panic attacks. It has not been easy.\u201d",
      "The war has not only deepened the struggles of young patients.",
      "\u201cMany physicians have had to relocate,\u201d Noun said. \u201cI know physicians, who work here, who haven\u2019t seen their parents in like six weeks because the roads are very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by cascading crises \u2014 economic collapse, the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020, and now a relentless war \u2014 leaving institutions like the cancer center struggling to secure the funds needed to save lives.",
      "\u201cCancer waits for no one,\u201d Chami said. The crises have affected the center\u2019s ability to hold fundraising events in recent years, leaving it in urgent need of donations, she added.",
      "The facility is currently treating more than 400 patients aged from few days to 18 years old, Chami said. It treats around 60% of children with cancer in Lebanon.",
      "For Carol, the war is sometimes a topic of conversation with her friends at the cancer center. Her mother hears her recount hearing the booms and how the house shook.",
      "For others, the moments with their friends in the center's playroom provide a brief escape from the grim reality outside.",
      "Eight-year-old Mohammad Mousawi darts around the playroom, giggling as he hides objects and books for his playmate to find. Too absorbed by the game, he barely answers questions, before the nurse calls him for his weekly chemotherapy treatment.",
      "His family lived in Ghobeiry, a neighborhood in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Their house was marked for destruction in an Israeli evacuation warning weeks ago, his mother said.",
      "\u201cBut till now, they haven\u2019t struck it,\u201d said his mother, Suzan Mousawi. \u201cThey have hit (buildings) around it \u2014 two behind it and two in front of it.\u201d",
      "The family has relocated three times. They first moved to the mountains, but the bitter cold weakened Mohammad\u2019s already fragile immune system.",
      "Now they\u2019ve settled in Ain el-Rummaneh, not far from their home in the southern Beirut suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which has come under significant bombardment. As the Israeli military widened the radius of its bombardment, some buildings hit were less than 500 meters (yards) from their current home.",
      "The Mousawis have lived their entire lives in Dahiyeh, Suzan Mousawi said, until the war uprooted them. Her parents\u2019 home was bombed. \u201cAll our memories are gone,\u201d she said.",
      "Mohammad has 15 weeks of treatment left, and his family is praying it will be successful. But the war has stolen some of their dreams.",
      "\u201cWhen Mohammad fell ill, we bought a house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t big, but it was something. I bought him an electric scooter and set up a pool, telling myself we\u2019d take him there once he finishes treatment.\u201d",
      "She fears the house, bought with every penny she had saved, could be lost at any moment.",
      "For some families, this kind of conflict is not new. Asinat Al Lahham, a 9-year-old patient of the cancer center, is a refugee whose family fled Syria.",
      "\u201cWe escaped one war to another,\u201d Asinat\u2019s mother, Fatima, added.",
      "As her father, Aouni, drove home from her chemotherapy treatment weeks ago, an airstrike happened. He cranked up the music in the car, trying to drown out the deafening sound of the attack.",
      "Asinat sat in the back seat, clutching her favorite toy. \u201cI wanted to distract her, to make her hear less of it,\u201d he said.",
      "In the medical ward on a recent day, Asinat sat in a chair hooked to an IV drip, negotiating with her doctor. \u201cJust two or three small pinches,\u201d she pleaded, asking for flavoring for her instant noodles that she is not supposed to have.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe \u2026 nowhere is safe \u2026 not Lebanon, not Syria, not Palestine,\u201d Asinat said. \u201cThe sonic booms are scary, but the noodles make it better,\u201d she added with a mischievous grin.",
      "The family has no choice but to stay in Lebanon. Returning to Syria, where their home is gone, would mean giving up Asinat\u2019s treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t leave here,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThis war, her illness \u2026 it\u2019s like there\u2019s no escape.\u201d"

      "The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary argued that the First Amendment protects the right to advertise because Mississippi law permits the sale of cannabis products to people with debilitating medical conditions. The state enacted its law in 2022.",
      "A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana.",
      "The federal law applies in all states, and Mississippi \u201cfaces no constitutional obstacle to restricting commercial speech relating to unlawful transactions,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The Mississippi attorney general's office praised the court decision for upholding \"Mississippi\u2019s reasonable restrictions on advertising for medical marijuana dispensaries by print, broadcast, and other mass communications,\u201d said the office spokesperson, MaryAsa Lee.",
      "Clarence Cocroft II operates Tru Source Medical Cannabis in the northern Mississippi city of Olive Branch. He sued the state in 2023 to challenge its ban on medical marijuana advertising on billboards or in print, broadcast or social media or via mass email or text messaging.",
      "\u201cUpholding this ban makes it incredibly difficult for me to find potential customers and to educate people about Mississippi\u2019s medical marijuana program,\u201d Cocroft said in a statement Monday. \u201cI remain committed to continuing this fight so my business can be treated the same as any other legal business in Mississippi.\u201d",
      "The state allows medical marijuana businesses to have websites or social media accounts that provide information about their retail dispensing locations and a list of products available. It allows them to be listed in phone books or business directories and to display cannabis in company logos. The businesses can also sponsor not-for-profit charity or advocacy events.",
      "Cocroft is represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm. The firm said Monday that it is considering its next steps in the lawsuit, including possibly asking the entire appeals court to reconsider the case or an appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cMississippi cannot on the one hand create an entire marketplace for the sale of medical marijuana, and on the other hand rely on an unenforced federal law to prohibit buyers and sellers from talking about it,\u201d said Ari Bargil, an Institute for Justice attorney."

      "Millions of obese Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cIt's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\u201d",
      "The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.",
      "Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese \u2014 someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\u201cFor half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\u201d Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year. Ozempic is a diabetes drug that can stimulate weight loss."

      "The victory for reproductive rights groups sets the stage for their next battle: challenging other laws on the books in Arizona they say are too restrictive. The 15-week cutoff, for example, allows exceptions only when the mother's life is at risk.",

Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they'll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Abortion has long been an important political issue in the U.S., but it\u2019s become a defining one since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v.

Earlier this year, Arizonans faced the possibility of living under a near-total abortion ban.",

The election loss was blamed on voter anger over his party\u2019s financial misconduct, and he is trying to quickly tackle reforms.",

      "DABROWKA, Poland -- Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk traveled Saturday to his country's border with the Russian region of Kaliningrad to inspect progress in the construction of military fortifications along the eastern frontier, calling it \"an investment in peace.\"",
      "Tusk\u2019s visit comes a month before Poland is to take over the rotating presidency of the 27-member European Union. Polish officials say their priority is to urge Europeans to beef up defenses at a time of Russian aggression and with change coming soon in Washington. Some European leaders are concerned that the incoming administration of Donald Trump might be less committed to Europe\u2019s defense.",
      "Tusk also proposed this week that Poland and the Nordic and Baltic countries carry out joint navy patrols in the strategically important Baltic Sea, following the suspected sabotage of undersea data cables.",
      "Poland's government and army began building the system dubbed East Shield this year. It will eventually include approximately 800 kilometers (500 miles) along the Polish borders with Russia and Belarus, at a time when Western officials accuse Russia of waging hybrid attacks against the West that include sabotage, the weaponization of migration, disinformation and other hostile measures.",
      "\u201cThe better the Polish border is guarded, the more difficult it is to access for those with bad intentions,\u201d Tusk said at a news conference near the village of Dabrowka as he stood in front of concrete anti-tank barriers.",
      "Poland has been at the mercy of aggressive neighbors over the past centuries and has become a leading European voice for security at a time when France and Germany are weakened by internal political problems. Poland aims to spend 4.7% of its gross domestic product on defense next year, making it one of NATO's leaders in defense spending.",
      "Tusk's government estimates that the strategic military project will cost at least 10 billion zlotys ($2.5 billion). Poland\u2019s borders with Russia, Belarus \u2014 as well as Ukraine \u2014 are the easternmost external borders of both the European Union and NATO.",

      "\u201cEverything we are doing here \u2014 and we will also be doing this on the border with Belarus and Ukraine \u2014 is to deter and discourage a potential aggressor, which is why it is truly an investment in peace,\" Tusk said. \u201cWe will spend billions of zlotys on this, but right now the whole of Europe is observing these investments and our actions with great satisfaction and will support them if necessary.\u201d",
      "Tusk did not elaborate on his plans for reinforcing the border with Ukraine, a close ally.",
      "Along the frontier, anti-tank barriers known as \u201chedgehogs\u201d will be integrated with natural barriers like ditches. Tusk said parts of the project are not visible to the naked eye, but it is nonetheless the largest project of its nature in Europe since the end of World War II.",
      "The plans also include the construction of threat reconnaissance and detection systems, forward bases, logistics hubs, warehouses and the deployment of anti-drone systems, the state news agency PAP reported.",

      "The push into Aleppo followed weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, which has backed Syrian opposition groups, failed in its diplomatic efforts to prevent the Syrian government attacks, which were seen as a violation of a 2019 agreement sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran to freeze the line of the conflict.",
      "The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, primarily Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, which has backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battles at home. A ceasefire in Hezbollah\u2019s two-month war with Israel took effect Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days.",
      "A witness in Aleppo said government troops remained in the city's airport and at a military academy but most of the forces have already filed out of the city from the south. Syrian Kurdish forces remained in two neighborhoods.",
      "The redeployment \u201cis a temporary measure and (the military central command and armed forces) will work to guarantee the security and peace of all our people in Aleppo,\u201d the military statement said.",
      "Abdulkafi Alhamdo, an teacher who fled Aleppo in 2016 and returned Friday night after hearing the insurgents were inside, described \u201cmixed feelings of pain, sadness and old memories.\"",
      "\u201cAs I entered Aleppo, I kept telling myself this is impossible! How did this happen?\u201d He said he strolled through the city at night, visiting the citadel, where the insurgents raised their flags, a major square and the university of Aleppo, as well as the last spot he was in before he was forced to leave for the countryside.",
      "\u201cI walked in (the empty) streets of Aleppo, shouting, \u2018People, people of Aleppo. We are your sons,\u2019\u201d Alhamdo told The Associated Press in a series of messages.",
      "The insurgents launched their shock offensive in the Aleppo and Idlib countryside on Wednesday and wrestled control of dozens of villages and towns before entering Aleppo on Friday.",
      "The pro-government Al-Watan newspaper reported airstrikes on the edge of Aleppo city targeting rebel supply lines. It posted a video of a missile landing on a gathering of fighters and vehicles, in a street lined with trees and buildings.",
      "Twenty fighters were killed in the airstrikes, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Aleppo residents reported clashes and gunfire. Some fled the fighting.",
      "Schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station. Bakeries were open. Witnesses said the insurgents deployed security forces around the city to prevent any acts of violence or looting.",
      "In social media post, the insurgents were pictured outside of Aleppo Citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. In cellphone videos, they recorded themselves having conversations with residents they visited at home, seeking to reassure them they will cause no harm.",
      "State media reported that a number of \u201cterrorists,\" including sleeper cells, infiltrated parts of the city. Government troops chased them and arrested a number who posed for pictures near city landmarks, state media said.",
      "On a state TV morning show Saturday, commentators said army reinforcements and Russia\u2019s assistance will repel the \u201cterrorist groups,\u201d blaming Turkey for supporting the insurgents\u2019 push into Aleppo and Idlib provinces.",

      "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos says impeaching the vice president, who is facing a legal storm after publicly threatening to have him killed, would be a waste of time for Congress",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Friday that filing impeachment complaints against the vice president, who is facing a legal storm after publicly threatening to have him killed, would be a waste of time for Congress.",
      "It was unclear whether Marcos\u2019 remark would stop plans by several groups to file impeachment complaints against Duterte over a number of criminal allegations, including her alleged misuse of confidential government funds and her recent public threat to have the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives killed if she herself were killed in a plot she has not detailed.",
      "The legal troubles facing the vice president and her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, are unfolding in the backdrop of their worsening feud with Marcos. It's the latest battle between the country's most powerful families in a long-unwieldy democracy that has been dominated for decades by political dynasties.",
      "But Marcos played down the political showdown.",
      "\"It\u2019s a storm in a teacup,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "\"This is not important. This will not make any difference to even one single Filipino life, so, why waste time on it?\u201d he said of an impeachment. Impeachment complaints are being prepared for filing before the House, which is led by Marcos\u2019 cousin and political ally, Martin Romualdez.",
      "Duterte regards Romualdez as a bitter opponent. Both are seen as potential presidential candidates in 2028.",
      "Duterte has ruled out a political reconciliation with Marcos. They were running mates in 2022 and won by landslides in a campaign of national unity but later had a falling out on several issues, including over their support for China or the Unites States.",
      "Marcos has strengthened a defense alliance with the U.S. as the Philippines faces an increasingly aggressive China in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The vice president has refused to condemn China\u2019s assertive actions and her father nurtured close ties as president with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while criticizing U.S. and Western security policies.",
      "Marcos has also opposed the former president\u2019s anti-drug crackdown that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead and sparked an ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "When asked about the vice president\u2019s remark that their estranged political alliance \u201chas reached a point of return,\u201d the president said, \u201cNever say never.\"",
      "Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, failed to appear on Friday before investigators at the National Bureau of Investigation, which issued a subpoena for her to explain her threats against the president, his wife and Romualdez, which were made in an online news conference over the weekend.",
      "She said she needed to see the questions she would face, and her appearance before the investigators was reset to Dec. 11. The vice president has said her remarks were not actual threats and were made to highlight an unspecified danger she was facing.",
      "Marcos has said her remarks were a criminal plot and added he would fight back.",
      "Under Philippine law, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or their family and are punishable by a prison term and fine.",
      "Separately, the Department of Justice has said investigators are looking into potentially seditious remarks by the vice president\u2019s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who said in a news conference on Monday that the government would only seriously listen to allegations of government corruption if the military speaks up.",
      "\u201cThere is a fractured governance,\u201d the former president said. \u201cIt is only the military who can correct it.\u201d",
      "He clarified that he was not calling on the military to stage an uprising. He also asked how long the military could still serve under a commander in chief \u201cwho is a drug addict\u201d \u2014 an accusation he has made often and Marcos has repeatedly denied.",

      "Mexican authorities have raided a massive complex of stores selling counterfeit Chinese goods in downtown Mexico City, and vowed the crackdown will be carried out nationwide",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican authorities raided a massive complex of stores selling counterfeit Chinese and other Asian goods in downtown Mexico City, and vowed Friday to take the crackdown nationwide.",
      "Over 200 police, marines and inspectors raided a building known as \u201cMexico Mart\u201d in the city\u2019s colonial center Thursday and seized around 90,000 counterfeit products that masqueraded as name-brand goods. They seized a total of over 262,000 products that had no receipts, import documents or, in some cases, even labels.",
      "It is not clear if the counterfeits \u2014 which included imitations of Marvel, Sanr\u00edo, Disney and Nintendo products \u2014 were part of the 262,000 product count, or were counted separately. Officials said it took seven hours to seize all the merchandise.",
      "The entire facade of the building is labelled in Chinese characters, as are most of the stores inside. Authorities said the goods were from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam.",
      "The timing of the raid was noteworthy, given that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican products, and some U.S. politicians have worried that Mexico was serving as a conduit for Chinese goods to flood the American market.",
      "There was no evidence that any of the goods were intended for re-export to the United States; they appeared destined for Mexican street vendors who flood the downtown area around Christmas.",
      "But it was also clear that authorities had known for a long time what went on in the complex, which resembles a shopping center for wholesalers or bulk buyers. Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said three raids had been carried out previously at the same address.",
      "\u201cThey didn't have any labels,\u201d Ebrard said of the products. \u201cThey were in violation of all the norms,\u201d he said, adding that the haul included \u201ca whole mountain of Disney products, all pirated.\u201d",
      "Mexican officials have said they will try to substitute Chinese imports, by encouraging companies to manufacture locally.",
      "Ebrard said prosecutors would seize the building from its owners and destroy the contraband goods. He also said that, if import documents are found, the shipping and customs agents who signed off on them would also be investigated.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be working throughout the country ... in the seaports and airports,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cThis has to be a permanent operation.\u201d",
      "Chinese products, often ordered over retail websites, have flooded Mexico in recent years, particularly toys, houseware and inexpensive electric bicycles and scooters.",

    "story": [
      "Vote counting is underway in Ireland\u2019s national election",
      "DUBLIN -- Vote counting was underway Saturday in Ireland\u2019s national election after an exit poll suggested the contest is a close-fought race among the country\u2019s three largest political parties.",
      "Ballot boxes were opened at 9 a.m. at count centers across the country, kicking off long hours, or even days, of tallying the results. If the exit poll is borne out, that could be followed by days or weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government.",
      "The exit poll suggested voters\u2019 support is split widely among the three big parties \u2014 Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein \u2014 as well as several smaller parties and an assortment of independents ranging from the left to the far right.",
      "The poll said center-right party Fine Gael was the first choice of 21% of voters, and another center-right party, Fianna Fail, of 19.5%. The two parties governed in coalition before the election. Left-of-center opposition party Sinn Fein was at 21.1% in the poll.",
      "Pollster Ipsos B&A asked 5,018 voters across the country how they had cast their ballots. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.",
      "The figures only give an indication and don\u2019t reveal which parties will form the next government. Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country\u2019s 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take some time for full results to be known.",
      "Fianna Fail politician Michael McGrath, a former finance minister and now a European Union official, said \u201ca number of different parties and groups will have to be involved\u201d in forming a government.",
      "\u201cI hope it is a stable government that has the prospect of lasting the five years because of the challenges we are facing in Ireland and throughout the European Union,\" he told the PA news agency at a count in Cork, southwest Ireland. \u201cLet\u2019s allow the picture to emerge over the days ahead.\u201d",
      "The result will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The cost of living \u2014 especially Ireland\u2019s acute housing crisis \u2014 was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration.",
      "The outgoing government was led by the two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition.",
      "Before polling day, analysts said the most likely outcome was another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition. That remains a likely option, but the parties would need the support of smaller groups or independents to achieve a majority in the 174-seat Dail, the lower house of Parliament.",
      "Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "Though Sinn Fein, which aims to reunite Northern Ireland with the independent Republic of Ireland, could become the largest party in the Dail, it may struggle to get enough coalition partners to form a government. During the election campaign, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail maintained they would not go into government with it.",
      "The party, which had urged people to vote for change, hailed the result after the exit poll was released.",
      "\u201cThere is every chance that Sinn Fein will emerge from these elections as the largest political party,\u201d Sinn Fein director of elections Matt Carthy told broadcaster RTE on Friday night.",

      "The Israeli military says its aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria\u2019s border with Lebanon",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that halted months of fighting between the sides but has seen continued sporadic fire.",
      "The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or activists monitoring the conflict in that country. Hezbollah also did not immediately comment. Israeli aircraft have struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, citing ceasefire violations, several times since the ceasefire began on Wednesday.",
      "The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah does not address the war in Gaza, where fighting rages on. On Saturday, an Israeli strike on a car killed five people, according to Muneer Alboursh, a senior Palestinian health official, who said the toll included three employees of the charity World Central Kitchen. The charity could not immediately be reached for comment and made no mention of the incident on its social media.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a vehicle carrying a militant involved in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. It said it was looking into the reported ties to WCK, but said the car was unmarked and had not coordinated aid delivery with the military as charities have done during the war.",
      "An Israeli strike in April on a WCK convoy killed seven of its workers, most of them foreigners. The Israeli military said it was a mistake.",
      "The Israeli strike in Syria came as insurgents there breached the country's largest city, Aleppo, in a shock offensive that added fresh uncertainty to a region reeling from multiple wars.",
      "The truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah, brokered by the United States and France, calls for an initial two-month ceasefire in which the militants are to withdraw north of Lebanon's Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border.",
      "The repeated bursts of violence \u2014 with no reports of serious casualties \u2014 reflected the uneasy nature of the ceasefire that otherwise appeared to hold. While Israel has accused Hezbollah of violating the ceasefire, Lebanon has also accused Israel of the same in the days since it took effect.",
      "Many Lebanese, some of the 1.2 million displaced in the conflict, were streaming south to their homes, despite warnings by the Israeli and Lebanese militaries to stay away from certain areas.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli drone attacked a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun. The agency said there had been casualties but gave no further details. Majdal Zoun, near the Mediterranean Sea, is close to where Israeli troops still have a presence.",
      "The military said earlier Saturday that its forces, who remain in southern Lebanon until they withdraw gradually over the 60-day period, had been operating to distance \u201csuspects\u201d in the region, without elaborating, and said troops had located and seized weapons found hidden in a mosque.",
      "Israel says it reserves the right under the ceasefire to strike against any perceived violations. Israel has made returning the tens of thousands of displaced Israelis home the goal of the war with Hezbollah but Israelis, concerned Hezbollah was not deterred and could still attack northern communities, have been apprehensive about returning home.",
      "Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas and its assault on southern Israel the day before. Israel and Hezbollah kept up a low-level conflict of cross-border fire for nearly a year, until Israel escalated its fight with a sophisticated attack that detonated hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah fighters. It followed that up with an intense aerial bombardment campaign against Hezbollah assets, killing many of its top leaders including longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah, and it launched a ground invasion in early October.",
      "More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel \u2014 over half of them civilians \u2014 as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon.",
      "The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas' October 2023 attack, when militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians and took some 250 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count but say more than half the dead were women and children.",

    "story": [
      "It was an alarming, even sickening, suggestion: Farmers in Zimbabwe hit hard by drought should farm maggots to feed their animals and boost their household incomes",
      "NYANGAMBE, Zimbabwe -- At first, the suggestion to try farming maggots spooked Mari Choumumba and other farmers in Nyangambe, a region in southeastern Zimbabwe where drought wiped out the staple crop of corn.",
      "After multiple cholera outbreaks in the southern African nation resulting from extreme weather and poor sanitation, flies were largely seen as something to exterminate, not breed.",
      "\u201cWe were alarmed,\u201d Choumumba said, recalling a community meeting where experts from the government and the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, broached the idea.",
      "People had flocked to the gathering in hope of news about food aid. But many stepped back when told it was about training on farming maggots for animal feed and garden manure.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018What? These are flies, flies bring cholera\u2019,\u201d Choumumba said.",
      "A year later, the 54-year-old walks with a smile to a smelly cement pit covered by wire mesh where she feeds rotting waste to maggots \u2014 her new meal ticket.",
      "After harvesting the insects about once a month, Choumumba turns them into protein-rich feed for her free-range chickens that she eats and sells.",
      "Up to 80% of chicken production costs were gobbled up by feed for rural farmers before they took up maggot farming. Many couldn\u2019t afford the $35 charged by stores for a 50-kilogram (about 110-pound) bag of poultry feed, said Francis Makura, a specialist with a USAID program aimed at broadening revenue streams for farmers affected by climate change.",
      "But maggot farming reduces production costs by about 40%, he said.",
      "The maggots are offspring of the black soldier fly, which originates in tropical South America. Unlike the house fly, it is not known to spread disease.",
      "Their life cycle lasts just weeks, and they lay between 500 and 900 eggs. The larvae devour decaying organic items \u2014 from rotting fruit and vegetables to kitchen scraps and animal manure \u2014 and turn them into a rich protein source for livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is even better than the crude protein we get from soya,\u201d said Robert Musundire, a professor specializing in agricultural science and entomology at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Zimbabwe, which breeds the insects and helps farmers with breeding skills.",
      "Donors and governments have pushed for more black soldier fly maggot farming in Africa because of its low labor and production costs and huge benefits to agriculture, the continent\u2019s mainstay that is under pressure from climate change and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "In Uganda, the maggots helped plug a fertilizer crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In Nigeria and Kenya, they are becoming a commercial success.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the government and partners piloted it among farmers struggling with securing soya meal for their animals. A World Bank-led project later used it as a recovery effort for communities affected by a devastating 2019 cyclone.",
      "Now it is becoming a lifesaver for some communities in the country of 15 million people where repeated droughts make it difficult to grow corn. It's not clear how many people across the country are involved in maggot-farming projects.",
      "At first, \u201ca mere 5%\u201d of farmers that Musundire, the professor, approached agreed to venture into maggot farming. Now that\u2019s up to \u201cabout 50%,\u201d he said, after people understood the protein benefits and the lack of disease transmission.",
      "The \u201cyuck factor\u201d was an issue. But necessity triumphed, he said.",
      "With the drought decimating crops and big livestock such as cattle \u2014 a traditional symbol of wealth and status and a source of labor \u2014 small livestock like chickens are helping communities recover more quickly.",
      "\u201cThey can fairly raise a decent livelihood out of the resources they have within a short period of time,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "It also helps the environment. Zimbabwe produces about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, 90% of which can be recycled or composted, according to the country\u2019s Environmental Management Agency. Experts say feeding it to maggots can help reduce greenhouse emissions in a country where garbage collection is erratic.",
      "At a plot near the university, Musundire and his students run a maggot breeding center in the city of 100,000 people. The project collects over 35 metric tons a month in food waste from the university\u2019s canteens as well as vegetable markets, supermarkets, abattoirs, food processing companies and beer brewers.",
      "\u201cFood waste is living, it respires and it contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, food loss \u2014 which occurs in the stages before reaching the consumer \u2014 and food waste after sale account for 8% to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, or about five times that of the aviation sector.",
      "The university project converts about 20-30 metric tons of the waste into livestock protein or garden manure in about two weeks.",
      "Choumambo said people often sneer as she goes around her own community collecting banana peels and other waste that people toss out at the market and bus station.",
      "\u201cI tell them we have good use for it, it is food for our maggots,\u201d she said. She still has to contend with \u201cignorant\u201d people who accuse maggot farmers of \u201cbreeding cholera.\u201d",
      "But she cares little about that as her farm begins to thrive.",
      "From bare survival, it is becoming a profitable venture. She can harvest up to 15 kilograms (about 33 pounds) of maggots in 21 days, turning out 375 kilograms (826.7 pounds) of chicken feed after mixing it with drought-tolerant crops such as millets, cowpeas and sunflower and a bit of salt.",
      "Choumambo sells some of the feed to fellow villagers at a fraction of the cost charged by stores for traditional animal feed. She also sells eggs and free-range chickens, a delicacy in Zimbabwe, to restaurants. She's one of 14 women in her village taking up the project.",
      "\u201cI never imagined keeping and surviving on maggots,\u201d she said, taking turns with a neighbor to mix rotting vegetables, corn meal and other waste in a tank using a shovel.",
      "\u201cMany people would puke at the sight and the stench. But this is the sweet smell of food for the maggots, and for us, the farmers.\u201d",

      "The head of Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence service says Russia is conducting a \u201cstaggeringly reckless\u201d sabotage campaign against Ukraine's allies that risks dangerously escalating the conflict",
      "PARIS -- The head of Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence service said Friday that Russia is conducting a \u201cstaggeringly reckless\u201d sabotage campaign against Ukraine's Western allies, and that his spies are working to stop the consequences from spiraling out of control.",
      "And in a message aimed in part at U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump, MI6 chief Richard Moore said that Russian victory in Ukraine would threaten American, as well as European, security.",
      "Moore said his agency and its French counterpart were working together to a dangerous escalation by \u201ccalibrating the risk and informing the decisions of our respective governments\u201d in response to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cmix of bluster and aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have recently uncovered a staggeringly reckless campaign of Russian sabotage in Europe, even as Putin and his acolytes resort to nuclear saber-rattling, to sow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine,\u201d Moore said during a speech to diplomats and intelligence officials in France.",
      "\u201cSuch activity and rhetoric is dangerous and beyond irresponsible,\u201d he said.",
      "Moore spoke alongside Nicolas Lerner, head of France\u2019s external intelligence agency, the DGSE at an event marking 120 years of the Entente Cordiale, a pact between Britain and France that bound the age-old rivals together as military and diplomatic allies.",
      "Western security officials suspect that Russian intelligence is trying to destabilize Ukraine\u2019s allies through disinformation, sabotage and arson.",
      "Moscow has been linked by Western officials to several planned attacks in Europe, including an alleged plot to burn down Ukrainian-owned businesses in London, and to incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes. In July one caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another ignited in a warehouse in England.",
      "Lerner agreed that \u201cthe collective security of the whole of Europe is at stake\u201d in Ukraine. He said Britain\u2019s experience tackling Russia in the wake of recent attacks like the 2018 Salisbury Novichok poisoning of a former Russian spy, was invaluable to French intelligence seeking to defuse Russian actions.",
      "Britain and France have been among Ukrainian allies most willing to allow Kyiv to use weapons they supply \u2013 especially missiles known as Scalp in France and Storm Shadow in Britain \u2013 to hit targets inside Russia. The Biden administration recently eased its long-held opposition to U.S.-made missiles being used to strike Russia. Ukraine said last week it had used the American ATACM missiles to target Russia for the first time in the war.",
      "Since then, Putin has lowered the official threshold for Russia\u2019s use of its nuclear weapons, and Russia has pounded Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure with hundreds of missiles and drones, in what Putin said was a response to the firing of the American missiles against Russian soil. Russia also fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, called Oreshnik, and Putin threatened to use it against \u201cdecision-making centers\u201d in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.",
      "In a warning to allies wavering in support for Ukraine, Moore said that \u201cthe cost of supporting Ukraine is well-known, but the cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher.\u201d",
      "Trump has criticized the billions the Biden administration has spent in supporting Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours \u2014 comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.",
      "\u201cIf Putin is allowed to succeed in reducing Ukraine to a vassal state, he will not stop there,\" Moore said. \"Our security \u2014 British, French, European and trans-Atlantic \u2014 will be jeopardized.\u201d",
      "He said that if Russia wins, Iran and China \u2014 which so far support Moscow as \u201ca transaction\" \u2014 would draw closer to Russia.",
      "\u201cIf Putin succeeds, China would weigh the implications, North Korea would be emboldened and Iran would become yet more dangerous,\u201d Moore said.",
      "Some European officials worry about what Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda means for trans-Atlantic relations, but Moore \u2014 whose name has been mentioned as a possible choice for U.K. ambassador to Washington \u2014 said he was confident the bond was strong.",
      "\u201cFor decades the U.S.-U.K. intelligence alliance has made our societies safer,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked successfully with the first Trump administration to advance our shared security and look forward to doing so again.\u201d",

      "Authorities have not confirmed what caused the sinking but local media suggested the boat may have been overloaded. Overcrowding on boats is common in remote parts of Nigeria where the lack of good roads leaves many with no alternative routes.",
      "According to Justin Uwazuruonye, who is in charge of Nigeria\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency operations in the state, rescuers had trouble finding the location of the capsizing for hours after Friday's tragedy struck.",
      "Such deadly incidents are increasingly becoming a source of concern in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, as authorities struggle to enforce safety measures and regulations for water transportation.",
      "Most of the accidents have been attributed to overcrowding and the lack of maintenance of the boats, often built locally to accommodate as many passengers as possible in defiance of safety measures.",
      "Also, authorities have not been able to enforce the use of life jackets on such trips, often because of lack of availability or cost."

      "Cucumbers shipped to the U.S. and Canada, and organic eggs sold in 25 Costco stores in five southern U.S. states, were recalled this week for potential salmonella contamination.",
      "The cucumber outbreak sickened 68 people, including 18 who were hospitalized, in 19 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. No one has died. Produce grown in Sonora, Mexico, by Agrotato S.A. may be the culprit, the agency said.",
      "A recall announced Thursday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was tied to the outbreak. SunFed Produce, based in Arizona, recalled cucumbers sold between Oct. 12 and Nov. 26, the FDA said.",
      "The recall happened after SunFed was told by the FDA that there were associated illnesses reported between Oct. 12 and Nov. 15. People who bought cucumbers during the window should check with the store where they purchased them to see if the produce is part of the recall.",
      "The egg recall involved nearly 11,000 cartons of 24-count organic eggs sold under Costco's Kirkland Signature brand that landed on shelves in Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee starting Nov. 22, according to the company\u2019s announcement posted Wednesday on the FDA website.",
      "No illnesses were immediately reported. Handsome Brook Farms said the cartons included eggs that were \u201cnot intended for retail distribution.\" Shoppers should check to see whether their egg cartons have Julian code 327 printed on the side and have a use-by date of Jan. 5, 2025. If the eggs are included in the recall, throw them out or take them back to the store for a refund.",
      "Customers who had either of the recalled food products should wash items and surfaces that may have been in contact with the foods using hot, soapy water or a dishwasher.",
      "Salmonella can cause symptoms that begin six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria and include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover without treatment within a week, but young children, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill.",

    "story": [
      "It was an alarming, even sickening, suggestion: Farmers in Zimbabwe hit hard by drought should farm maggots to feed their animals and boost their household incomes",
      "NYANGAMBE, Zimbabwe -- At first, the suggestion to try farming maggots spooked Mari Choumumba and other farmers in Nyangambe, a region in southeastern Zimbabwe where drought wiped out the staple crop of corn.",
      "After multiple cholera outbreaks in the southern African nation resulting from extreme weather and poor sanitation, flies were largely seen as something to exterminate, not breed.",
      "\u201cWe were alarmed,\u201d Choumumba said, recalling a community meeting where experts from the government and the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, broached the idea.",
      "People had flocked to the gathering in hope of news about food aid. But many stepped back when told it was about training on farming maggots for animal feed and garden manure.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018What? These are flies, flies bring cholera\u2019,\u201d Choumumba said.",
      "A year later, the 54-year-old walks with a smile to a smelly cement pit covered by wire mesh where she feeds rotting waste to maggots \u2014 her new meal ticket.",
      "After harvesting the insects about once a month, Choumumba turns them into protein-rich feed for her free-range chickens that she eats and sells.",
      "Up to 80% of chicken production costs were gobbled up by feed for rural farmers before they took up maggot farming. Many couldn\u2019t afford the $35 charged by stores for a 50-kilogram (about 110-pound) bag of poultry feed, said Francis Makura, a specialist with a USAID program aimed at broadening revenue streams for farmers affected by climate change.",
      "But maggot farming reduces production costs by about 40%, he said.",
      "The maggots are offspring of the black soldier fly, which originates in tropical South America. Unlike the house fly, it is not known to spread disease.",
      "Their life cycle lasts just weeks, and they lay between 500 and 900 eggs. The larvae devour decaying organic items \u2014 from rotting fruit and vegetables to kitchen scraps and animal manure \u2014 and turn them into a rich protein source for livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is even better than the crude protein we get from soya,\u201d said Robert Musundire, a professor specializing in agricultural science and entomology at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Zimbabwe, which breeds the insects and helps farmers with breeding skills.",
      "Donors and governments have pushed for more black soldier fly maggot farming in Africa because of its low labor and production costs and huge benefits to agriculture, the continent\u2019s mainstay that is under pressure from climate change and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "In Uganda, the maggots helped plug a fertilizer crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In Nigeria and Kenya, they are becoming a commercial success.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the government and partners piloted it among farmers struggling with securing soya meal for their animals. A World Bank-led project later used it as a recovery effort for communities affected by a devastating 2019 cyclone.",
      "Now it is becoming a lifesaver for some communities in the country of 15 million people where repeated droughts make it difficult to grow corn. It's not clear how many people across the country are involved in maggot-farming projects.",
      "At first, \u201ca mere 5%\u201d of farmers that Musundire, the professor, approached agreed to venture into maggot farming. Now that\u2019s up to \u201cabout 50%,\u201d he said, after people understood the protein benefits and the lack of disease transmission.",
      "The \u201cyuck factor\u201d was an issue. But necessity triumphed, he said.",
      "With the drought decimating crops and big livestock such as cattle \u2014 a traditional symbol of wealth and status and a source of labor \u2014 small livestock like chickens are helping communities recover more quickly.",
      "\u201cThey can fairly raise a decent livelihood out of the resources they have within a short period of time,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "It also helps the environment. Zimbabwe produces about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, 90% of which can be recycled or composted, according to the country\u2019s Environmental Management Agency. Experts say feeding it to maggots can help reduce greenhouse emissions in a country where garbage collection is erratic.",
      "At a plot near the university, Musundire and his students run a maggot breeding center in the city of 100,000 people. The project collects over 35 metric tons a month in food waste from the university\u2019s canteens as well as vegetable markets, supermarkets, abattoirs, food processing companies and beer brewers.",
      "\u201cFood waste is living, it respires and it contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, food loss \u2014 which occurs in the stages before reaching the consumer \u2014 and food waste after sale account for 8% to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, or about five times that of the aviation sector.",
      "The university project converts about 20-30 metric tons of the waste into livestock protein or garden manure in about two weeks.",
      "Choumambo said people often sneer as she goes around her own community collecting banana peels and other waste that people toss out at the market and bus station.",
      "\u201cI tell them we have good use for it, it is food for our maggots,\u201d she said. She still has to contend with \u201cignorant\u201d people who accuse maggot farmers of \u201cbreeding cholera.\u201d",
      "But she cares little about that as her farm begins to thrive.",
      "From bare survival, it is becoming a profitable venture. She can harvest up to 15 kilograms (about 33 pounds) of maggots in 21 days, turning out 375 kilograms (826.7 pounds) of chicken feed after mixing it with drought-tolerant crops such as millets, cowpeas and sunflower and a bit of salt.",
      "Choumambo sells some of the feed to fellow villagers at a fraction of the cost charged by stores for traditional animal feed. She also sells eggs and free-range chickens, a delicacy in Zimbabwe, to restaurants. She's one of 14 women in her village taking up the project.",
      "\u201cI never imagined keeping and surviving on maggots,\u201d she said, taking turns with a neighbor to mix rotting vegetables, corn meal and other waste in a tank using a shovel.",
      "\u201cMany people would puke at the sight and the stench. But this is the sweet smell of food for the maggots, and for us, the farmers.\u201d",

      "Over 200 police, marines and inspectors raided a building known as \u201cMexico Mart\u201d in the city\u2019s colonial center Thursday and seized around 90,000 counterfeit products that masqueraded as name-brand goods. They seized a total of over 262,000 products that had no receipts, import documents or, in some cases, even labels.",
      "It is not clear if the counterfeits \u2014 which included imitations of Marvel, Sanr\u00edo, Disney and Nintendo products \u2014 were part of the 262,000 product count, or were counted separately. Officials said it took seven hours to seize all the merchandise.",
      "The entire facade of the building is labelled in Chinese characters, as are most of the stores inside. Authorities said the goods were from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam.",
      "The timing of the raid was noteworthy, given that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican products, and some U.S. politicians have worried that Mexico was serving as a conduit for Chinese goods to flood the American market.",
      "There was no evidence that any of the goods were intended for re-export to the United States; they appeared destined for Mexican street vendors who flood the downtown area around Christmas.",
      "But it was also clear that authorities had known for a long time what went on in the complex, which resembles a shopping center for wholesalers or bulk buyers. Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said three raids had been carried out previously at the same address.",
      "\u201cThey didn't have any labels,\u201d Ebrard said of the products. \u201cThey were in violation of all the norms,\u201d he said, adding that the haul included \u201ca whole mountain of Disney products, all pirated.\u201d",
      "Mexican officials have said they will try to substitute Chinese imports, by encouraging companies to manufacture locally.",
      "Ebrard said prosecutors would seize the building from its owners and destroy the contraband goods. He also said that, if import documents are found, the shipping and customs agents who signed off on them would also be investigated.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be working throughout the country ... in the seaports and airports,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cThis has to be a permanent operation.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am actually shocked to see so many Black Friday deals because so many things are online,\u201d Morghan Clark said.",
      "Karessa Clark, who works as a nurse practitioner, said President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pending return to the White House made her feel better about the economy. She plans to spend $2,000 this holiday season, about $500 more than a year ago.",
      "Julie Rambo, a retired school teacher, shoved aside her worries about the incoming Trump administration as she shopped with her grandchildren at the Target in Southfield, Michigan.",
      "Rambo, 74, said she was \u201ctotally, completely scared of tariffs because I\u2019m still going to need an automobile,\u201d but it was a problem to confront later. As she does each year, she was primarily looking for Christmas gifts through a prison ministry for children with parents who are incarcerated.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019re shopping, we find things for ourselves too,\u201d Rambo said.",
      "Online sales figures from Thanksgiving Day gave retailers a reason to remain hopeful for a lucrative end to the year.",
      "Vivek Pandya, the lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said consumers\u202fspent a record $6.1 billion online Thursday, 8.8% more than on Thanksgiving last year. Bigger-than-expected discounts helped spur spending on electronics, apparel and other categories, Pandya said.",
      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then retreat to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research.",
      "Analysts forecast a solid holiday shopping season overall in the U.S., though perhaps not as robust as last year. Retailers were even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.",
      "Shoppers at Lakeside Shopping Center in Metairie, Louisiana, were treated to a glass of champagne and a $50 gift receipt.",
      "\u201cThis is a nice touch. I was just talking to my best friend and rehashing over Thanksgiving so this was a nice little treat after that conversation. Everyone needs a little drink,\u201d said Faren Kennedy, a Houston resident who was in town visiting family and wanted to stop at the mall for the nostalgia of Black Friday shopping.",
      "At Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, some 13,000 people showed up the first hour of its 7 a.m. opening, roughly 1,000 more than a year ago, according to Jill Renslow, the mall\u2019s chief business development and marketing officer.",
      "The mall was on target to exceed the 200,000 Black Friday customer visits it received in 2023, Renslow said. Stores with deep discounts and promotions were the most packed, she said, citing Lego\u2019s giveaway of a free retro record player with a $250 purchase.",
      "Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties, which operates 85 shopping properties, and Bill Taubman, president and chief operating officer of upscale mall landlord Taubman Realty Group, also said customer visits were up.",
      "Black Friday no longer is an American-only sales event. Retailers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. also appealed to holiday shoppers looking to save money.",
      "In India, about 200 Amazon warehouse workers and delivery drivers, rallied Friday in New Delhi, some wearing masks of Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, to demand better wages and working conditions. Similar protests were planned in other countries.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The owner of an oil field in Los Angeles County is suing the state of California over a law that will require it to stop production and plug its wells or face costly fines.",
      "Inglewood Oil Field owner Sentinel Peak argues in the lawsuit, filed this week, that the law, which was signed in September by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is unconstitutional, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.",
      "It is was one of several laws aiming to reduce pollution by giving local governments more authority to restrict oil and gas operations by shutting down so-called idle wells, which are not in use but have not been properly sealed and closed, and fining companies for operating low-producing oil wells in the Inglewood field.",
      "The 1,000-acre area southwest of downtown Los Angeles has approximately 820 unplugged wells, including 420 that are actively pumping. Roughly 80% of the operating wells are considered low-producing, meaning they yield less than 15 barrels of oil or 60,000 cubic feet of gas per day, the newspaper reported.",
      "Attorneys for Sentinel Peak argue that the law \u201crepresents an illegal attempt to coerce an individual company to stop operation of its legal business,\u201d according to court documents. They allege that mandatory fines, in particular, violate federal and state laws forbidding excessive fines.",
      "The suit calls the penalties \u201cgrossly\u201d disproportionate, with \u201cno apparent upper limit\u201d or \u201crelationship to any actual harm.\u201d",
      "The California Department of Conservation\u2019s Geological Energy Management Division, the state oil and gas regulator, declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "But Assemblyman Isaac Bryan, a Democrat who represents the area where the oil field is located and who authored the law, vowed to defend it.",
      "\u201cOur community has stood strong for decades to close this dangerous low-producing oil field, and we will stand strong in court to protect those frontline communities who have long deserved the right to live a full and healthy life,\u201d Bryan told the Times. \u201cThe people of California spoke through their legislature that dangerous oil wells have no business right next to the community.\u201d"

      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "Italy\u2019s most powerful trade unions called the eight-hour strike and mobilized marches in cities across the country to target Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s latest budget that they say penalizes schools, health care and other services. They also are pressing for a more equitable distribution of profits from private companies to workers.",
      "\u201cThese protests don\u2019t just speak to the government,\u2019\u2019 Maurizio Landini, head of the powerful CGIL conglomerate, told reporters in Bologna. \u201cThey speak also to entrepreneurs, managers and businesses, who in these years have made profits like never before.\u201d",
      "The strike forced ITA airlines to cancel dozens of domestic and international flights, and hit schools, hospitals and local transport. Unions called for an eight-hour strike but Transport Minister Matteo Salvini imposed an injunction limiting the strike in the transport sector to four hours.",
      "It was the first general strike since last November. Unions faced possible sanctions for involving the health care and justice sectors, which have staged strikes recently. The Italian railway, which also has been the target of recent labor actions, was exempted.",
      "Italy\u2019s health care sector has been suffering staffing shortages that has forced the hiring of nurses from abroad, with care in the poorer south particularly lagging that in the more prosperous north.",
      "\u201cThere are many people who go abroad because the salaries are too low,\u2019\u2019 said Anna Salsa, a member of the UIL health care union, at the demonstration in Rome. \u201cWe are forced to do double shifts to give the minimal levels of essential care.\u201d",
      "Protesters also cited persistent increases in the cost of basic necessities. Despite indications that inflation is cooling, the Codacons consumer protection lobby said that grocery costs for a family of four have risen by 238 euro ($251) a year in 2024 compared with last year, forcing many families to reduce their consumption.",
      "While starting salaries in Italy are aligned with the rest of Europe, pay increases do not keep pace, said Maurizio Del Conte, a labor law expert at Milan\u2019s Bocconi University. As a result, Italy\u2019s gross median salary of 35,000 euros (nearly $37,000) a year is at the low end of European averages, well behind its G7 partners in France and Germany.",
      "He noted that such protests are historically more influential when engaging center-left governments, which are friendly to unions, rather than conservative governments, such as Meloni's far-right-led government.",

      "The one-day-only pop-up from distributor Neon followed the success of a similar event in New York, hosted at the strip club at which the winner of the top prize at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival was filmed.",

      "\u201cExclusive is a buzzword, but it really is. It\u2019s an exclusive event because we all waited in line,\u201d said Nathan Zakim, who arrived at 10 a.m. for the 3 p.m. pop-up. \u201cWe all saw the movie. I think the movie merch mania should go on for as long as it can.\u201d",
      "Movie-themed merchandise is nothing new. Who can forget the iconic \u201cVote for Pedro\u201d T-shirt from \u201cNapoleon Dynamite\u201d that was seemingly everywhere in the early aughts?",
      "But in recent years, movie-inspired streetwear has exploded in popularity among film lovers, thanks in part to viral marketing campaigns put on by independent film studios. The result is clothing, often made in collaboration with popular brands, promoted as trendy and in limited supply.",
      "\u201cBeing this film buff type of person, I buy Blu-rays, I buy 4Ks. And that\u2019s not something that you can just pop out to someone and be like, \u2018I have this Criterion,\u2019\u201d said Natanael Avilez, who drove more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) for the \u201cAnora\u201d pop up. \u201cMerch is the second-best option of saying like, \u2018I do love movies and this is the way to express that.\u2019\u201d",

      "One catalyst in the trend\u2019s rise can be traced to 2018, when the clothing brand Online Ceramics and A24 joined forces. The brand, founded by artists Elijah Funk and Alix Ross, began with the idea of making bootleg T-shirts inspired by the Grateful Dead. Ross recounted two serendipitous moments in the company\u2019s history: One was watching Pete Davidson wearing a \u201cGood Time\u201d T-shirt on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\u201d in 2018.",
      "\u201cI was really jealous that we didn\u2019t make that,\u201d Ross recalled of Davidson\u2019s shirt, adorned with a poster image of Robert Pattinson and co-director Benny Safdie.",
      "The other was knowing, after just seeing the trailer, that Online Ceramics had to make \u201cHereditary\u201d T-shirts \u2014 with or without A24\u2019s permission. Thanks to a mutual friend, they managed to get in touch with the studio just before the film\u2019s release and got A24's stamp of approval.",
      "Hopeful online shoppers today will be disappointed as they scroll through dozens of Online Ceramics x A24 items, inspired by films like \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d \u201cMidsommar\u201d and \u201cLove Lies Bleeding,\u201d only to find each one sold out.",
      "Watching movies \u2014 following a pandemic and the rise of streaming \u2014 has become less of a collective experience in recent years. For many fans, repping their favorite films in public is a way to combat that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so fun knowing that everyone loves the movie so much to go stand in line for multiple hours. I got here three hours before it even opened and there\u2019s probably, like, 30 people in front of me,\u201d said Sabrina Bratt. \u201cPhysical keepsakes are just so cute and fun.\u201d",
      "For studios, the benefit is multifaceted. Not only is it an additional revenue source in a time of slowed production in Hollywood, it also is a way to engage with the fans that help keep their films in the zeitgeist long after they leave the theater.",
      "\u201cPeople, and particularly younger people, they want to be a part of something. And wearing a shirt for a movie is no different to wearing a shirt for the band that you just went to see. There\u2019s a cachet to it. There\u2019s a value to it. It\u2019s a sign of who I am,\u201d said Neon Chief Marketing Officer Christian Parkes.",
      "Alex Ng is the co-founder and creative director of the Los Angeles-based brand Brain Dead, which also owns a movie theater on Fairfax Avenue. As the film industry continues to evolve out of necessity, Ng contends this intersection of fashion and film will play an increasingly important role in Hollywood.",

So, if you go to an arthouse cinema, there\u2019s not a lot of things or souvenirs you could take away from a film that you love,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to connect those pieces. And I think that\u2019s the new era that we\u2019re seeing as a movie-going experience.\u201d",

      "The Santa Train marks its 82nd running this year, bringing presents and joy to small towns along a 110-mile portion of the CSX rail line tucked into remote coal-country river valleys. Many of the children who line the tracks and wait for Santa on the Saturday before Thanksgiving are the third, fourth or fifth generation to do so.",

      "Owens moved to Kentucky from Delaware 55 years ago when she got married and experienced her first Santa Train a few years later, when her son turned 3. He is 46 now, and these days she brings her grandchildren. In a few more years, she hopes to bring great-grandchildren.",
      "\u201cThe faces of the kids, that\u2019s what makes me happy,\u201d she said. \"You can\u2019t see anything better.\u201d",
      "The train starts out in Shelbiana, Kentucky, where families wait in the pre-dawn. At each stop there are dozens to hundreds of people. Many crowd around the back of the train, where Santa and his helpers toss stuffed animals. Meanwhile, groups of volunteer \u201celves\u201d carrying bags full of gifts fan out, making sure every child goes home with something. Each year they hand out more than 15 tons of gifts that include hats, mittens and fuzzy blankets along with board games, skate boards and teddy bears.",

      "Even though it is easier for people in these isolated, rural communities to buy Christmas presents these days, Dougherty made the short trek to Fort Blackmore with her niece on Saturday, carrying on the family tradition that she is glad she can still share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice that they do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows the true Christmas spirit.\u201d",
      "CSX employees consider it an honor to be chosen to staff the Santa Train as volunteers. Jesse Hensley had been trying to get a spot for 35 years, ever since he met his wife, Angie, who grew up with the Santa Train in St. Paul, Virginia.",
      "\u201cIt was such a thrill when we heard that whistle blow,\u201d she remembered. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, you know, you have dreams. My dream was to ride that train. Never in my life did I ever think that I would get to.\u201d",
      "The pair was selected to ride the train this year because they volunteered countless hours after the flooding caused by Hurricane Helene devastated their community of Erwin, Tennessee, where Jesse Hensley works as a machinist mechanic for CSX.",
      "The Santa Train doesn't run to Erwin, but CSX added a special event this year to bring cheer to the community. Residents were invited to a holiday party with food, music, and gifts in the Erwin rail yard. Santa paid a visit on train with cars decked out in lights forming the shapes of ornaments, moving jingle bells, marching toy soldiers, and the words \u201cHoliday Express\u201d in giant red letters.",
      "Two days later, Angie Hensley was all smiles on the Santa Train and nearly as excited as the children she helped distribute toys to, including grandnieces and grandnephews in St. Paul. The joy of helping on the Santa Train was even better than she had imagined, she said.",
      "Her fellow volunteers included CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs, who got off at every stop, handing out toys and talking to those who had come to see the train. Hinrichs' best memory so far was at a stop a couple of years ago when a family brought a disabled child but were hanging back from the train to avoid the tussle of the crowd. Helpers cleared a path to bring the boy forward and gave him a giant teddy bear they had saved for a special occasion.",
      "\u201cWe brought it out there, and everybody got around it, and we gave it to him. And there wasn\u2019t a dry eye anywhere,\u201d Hinrichs said. \"It was a magical moment.\u201d"

      "BOSTON -- A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time.",
      "Other locations have weighed similar \u201cgenerational tobacco bans,\u201d which phase out the use of tobacco products based not just on a person's age but on birth year.",
      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",
      "Other Massachusetts cities and towns already have approved similar tobacco bans, including Malden, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Jason Lewis, one of the backers of the statewide proposal, said the bill would \"save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth,\" he said.",
      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",
      "In 2022, 10.4% of adults in Massachusetts reported smoking cigarettes, according to the state Department of Public Health.",
      "Some California lawmakers have pushed to ban all tobacco sales, filing legislation last year to make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other products to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2007.",
      "In 2022, New Zealand became the first nation to pass a law intended to impose a lifetime ban on young people buying cigarettes by mandating that tobacco can\u2019t ever be sold to anybody born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. The law was later axed.",
      "In the U.K., Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed raising the legal age that people in England can buy cigarettes by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The proposal failed to win approval earlier this year."

      "Workers at one of Ukraine's thermal power plants struggle to repair damage and keep electricity flowing as Russia continues its campaign of attacks targeting the country's power grid",
      "On a bright winter day, workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant repair its heavily damaged equipment as drops of water from melted snow leak through gaping holes in its battered roof.",
      "Several weeks earlier, the facility was targeted by a Russian air attack that left scorch marks, shrapnel scars on the walls, and missile fragments scattered across the production floor.",
      "\u201cThis is our life now. Workers at a thermal power plant that\u2019s supposed to produce electricity are walking on frozen floors and using firewood to keep warm,\u201d Oleksandr, 52, head of the Production Management Department, told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used citing security concerns.",
      "Repeated Russian strikes on infrastructure have seriously impacted Ukraine's energy sector often resulting in rolling blackouts across the country. On Thursday, Moscow launched another large-scale air attack. Ukrainian authorities said nearly 200 drones and missiles targeted infrastructure, d isrupting power supply to more than a million people.",
      "The scale of the ongoing work to fix the sector is huge. Since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, th e G7 and other allied countries have allocated more than $4 billion in energy assistance to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in September.",
      "Oleksandr, who works at the power plant operated by Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy company, DTEK, says since the station was first attacked in November 2022, it has been unable to return to full capacity due to continuous strikes that have left critical equipment in ruins. The exact location of the plant visited by the AP, details on the damage and even workers\u2019 last names cannot be disclosed for fear this information could help Russia coordinate future attacks.",
      "DTEK operated around 20% of Ukraine\u2019s electricity production before the full-scale invasion, but this figure dropped to 12% since the war broke out. The company says its facilities have been attacked by Russia almost 200 times since 2022. They also say nearly 90% of the company\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed or suffered damage and that was before Russia launched its large-scale attack on Nov 17.",
      "Oleksandr says he expects repairs at the station to continue through the winter into next year, and potentially far beyond. Repair efforts at the plant are further complicated by the fact that some critical equipment was manufactured in the Soviet Union and finding parts is now difficult. To mitigate this, some former Soviet countries who are now Ukraine\u2019s allies have helped supply equipment.",
      "\u201cPotentially, Western countries could also help us with equipment, but their power grids have different characteristics,\u201d Oleksandr said.",
      "Only half of DTEK\u2019s generating capacities have been restored since the first attacks on its plants in November 2022 until the latest large-scale strike. Earlier this week, the European Commission and the U.S. government a nnounced a donation of $112 million in equipment and construction materials to help DTEK prepare for the winter.",
      "With the war in its third year, staff at DTEK\u2019s plant have adapted to the grim reality of their day-to-day existence. They know the protocols by heart. Not everyone can take shelter during an air alert. A minimal crew must remain in the control room to oversee operations, putting themselves at risk of a direct strike.",
      "\u201cYou have to sit and wait while monitoring the trajectories of whatever was fired, but the power units keep working so we cannot just leave, we stay in the control room,\u201d said Dmytro, 41, a power unit operator at the plant.",
      "Despite the challenges, Dmytro and his colleagues press on, driven by a mission to keep the lights on in their town and region over the winter months.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019ll do it, if not us? I also have family waiting for me at home, but if we all leave and the equipment breaks down, the responsibility will be on our shoulders, the entire city will lose electricity and heating,\u201d he said.",

      "The energy council \u2014 to be led by North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s choice to head the Interior Department \u2014 will be key in Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\" and sell more oil and other energy sources to allies in Europe and around the globe.",
      "The new council will be granted sweeping authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a mandate to cut bureaucratic red tape, enhance private sector investments and focus on innovation instead of \u201ctotally unnecessary regulation,\u201d Trump said.",
      "But Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits. For one, U.S. oil production under Biden is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",
      "A call for energy dominance \u2014 a term Trump also used in his first term as president \u2014 \"is an opportunity, not a requirement,'' for the oil industry to move forward on drilling projects under terms that are likely to be more favorable to industry than those offered by Biden, said energy analyst Kevin Book.",
      "Whether Trump achieves energy dominance \u2014 however he defines it \u2014 \"comes down to decisions by private companies, based on how they see supply-demand balances in the global marketplace,'' said Book, managing partner at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm. Don't expect an immediate influx of new oil rigs dotting the national landscape, he said.",
      "Trump's bid to boost oil supplies \u2014 and lower U.S. prices \u2014 is complicated by his threat this week to impose 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest sources of U.S. oil imports. The U.S. oil industry warned the tariffs could raise prices and even harm national security.",
      "\u201cCanada and Mexico are our top energy trading partners, and maintaining the free flow of energy products across our borders is critical for North American energy security and U.S. consumers,\u201d said Scott Lauermann, speaking for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry\u2019s top lobbying group.",
      "American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents U.S. refineries, also opposes potential tariffs, saying in a statement that \u201cAmerican refiners depend on crude oil from Canada and Mexico to produce the affordable, reliable fuels consumers count on every day.\"",
      "Energy lobbyist Scott Segal said the idea of centering energy decisions at the White House follows an example set by Biden, who named a trio of White House advisers to lead on climate policy. Segal, a partner at the law and policy law firm Bracewell, called Burgum \u201ca steady hand on the tiller\u201d with experience in fossil fuels and renewables.",
      "And unlike Biden\u2019s climate advisers \u2014 Gina McCarthy, John Podesta and Ali Zaidi \u2014 Burgum will probably take his White House post as a Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, Segal said.",
      "Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, called the new energy council \u201ca good thing\u201d for the U.S. economy and trade. \u201cConceptually it makes a lot of sense to have as much coordination as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, \u201cmarket dynamics will always be the key'' for any potential increase in energy production, Meyer said.",
      "Jonathan Elkind, a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, called energy dominance a \u201cdeliberately vague concept,\u201d but said, \u201cIt's hard to see how (Trump) can push more oil into an already saturated market.\"",
      "Trump has promised to bring gasoline prices below $2 a gallon, but experts call that highly unlikely, since crude oil prices would need to drop dramatically to achieve that goal. Gas prices averaged $3.06 nationally as of Friday, down from $3.25 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Elkind and other experts said they hope the new energy council will move beyond oil to focus on renewable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power, as well as nuclear. None of those energy resources produces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.",
      "\"Failure to focus on climate change as an existential threat to our planet is a huge concern and translates to a very significant loss of American property and American lives,'' said Elkind, a former assistant energy secretary in the Obama administration. He cited federal statistics showing two dozen weather disasters this year that caused more than $1 billion in damage each. A total of 418 people were killed.",
      "Trump has played down risks from climate change and pledged to rescind unspent money in the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden\u2019s landmark climate and health care bill. He also said he will stop offshore wind development when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "Even so, his Nov. 15 announcement of the energy council says he will \u201cexpand ALL forms of energy production to grow our Economy and create good-paying jobs.\u201d",
      "That includes renewables, said Safak Yucel, associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business.",
      "\"The mandate for the energy council is U.S. dominance globally, but what's more American than American solar and American wind?'' he asked. A report from Ernst & Young last year showed that solar was the cheapest source of new-build electricity in many markets.",
      "Trump, in his statement, said he wants to dramatically increase baseload power to lower electricity costs, avoid brownouts and \u201cWIN the battle for AI superiority.\"",
      "In comments to reporters before he was named to the energy post, Burgum cited a similar goal, noting increased demand for electricity from artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, and fast-growing data centers. \u201cThe AI battle affects everything from defense to health care to education to productivity as a country,\u2033 Burgum said.",
      "While Trump mocks the climate law as the \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d he is unlikely to repeal it, Yucel and other experts said. One reason: Most of its investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts. GOP members of Congress have urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to retain the law, which passed with only Democratic votes.",
      "\u201cA lot of Southern states are telling Trump, \u2018We actually like renewables,'\" Yucel said, noting that Republican-led states have added thousands of jobs in recent years in wind, solar and battery power.",
      "If renewables make economic economic sense, he added, \"they'll continue.''"

      "Russia's ruble is sagging against other currencies, complicating the Kremlin's efforts to keep consumer inflation under control with one hand even as it overheats the economy with spending on the war against Ukraine with the other.",
      "The official central bank rate for Friday was set at 109 to the U.S. dollar, meaning the ruble is worth less than a penny in dollar terms. At that rate, the ruble was bouncing back from lows around 114 to the dollar touched earlier in the week.",
      "There have been similar declines against the Chinese yuan, which has largely replaced dollars and euros for foreign trade after sanctions imposed by Ukraine's Western allies cut Russia off from most dealings with Western companies and banks.",
      "Russians interviewed on the street Friday in Moscow - where incautious remarks can lead to jail time - took the decline in stride.",
      "Muscovite Yekaterina, who declined to offer her last name, said she had just made a prepayment for a vacation in Egypt, adding \"I'm afraid to know what the rest of payment will be.\u201d But she added: \u201cMaybe it only concerns us individually, people who love travelling. But for Russian economy it\u2019s not that bad. Internal tourism, domestic industry are developing.\u201d",
      "Semyon, again no last name, was even less concerned. \u201cMy salary is in rubles, I pay taxes in rubles, I buy a car in rubles and buy groceries in rubles. What do I need the dollar for, explain that to me, please.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin is engaged in a tricky juggle. Government spending on the war has factories running at top speed and the economy growing more strongly than many expected given sanctions. The resulting inflation - an annual 8.5% in October - has led the central bank to crank up its interest rate benchmark to a painful 21% to slow borrowing and spending. That has led to complaints from business leaders hit with high credit costs and fostered predictions from economists that tight credit will eventually slow the economy.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the recent decline was \u201cconnected not only with inflation processes, it is also connected with payments to the budget, it is connected with oil prices, there are many factors of a seasonal nature.\u201d",
      "\u201cTherefore, in general, in my opinion, the situation is under control and there are certainly no grounds for panic.\u201d",
      "The ruble and inflation nonetheless remain key concerns for the Kremlin, said Janis Kluge, an expert on the Russian economy at the German Institute for Security and International Affairs in Berlin.",
      "\u201cThe inflation rate and the exchange rate, those two are very visible and you can feel it in your pocket,\u201d he said. \"And there is no propaganda in the world that will convince you prices are not rising when prices are rising. So this is why the Kremlin is so sensitive and really prioritizes fighting inflation so much.\u201d",
      "A lower ruble means Russians will over time pay more for imports, especially for autos, household appliances and electronics made in China, now Russia\u2019s chief trade partner, said Kluge.",
      "There are multiple reasons behind the ruble's recent decline from levels as high as 85 to the dollar in August. The price of oil - Russia's most important export - has weakened; foreign investors are no longer available to purchase ruble investments, and Russia's inflation rate means its currency tends to lose value against those of trade partners.",
      "A key factor recently may have been U.S. Treasury Department sanctions against Russia's Gazprombank, announced Nov. 21. Since the bank was the conduit for customers for what was left of Russia's oil and natural gas trade in Europe, the sanctions blocked one source of foreign earnings and increased pressure on the ruble. A big question is when, and whether, Russia might find a workaround for that.",
      "The weaker ruble isn't all bad for the Kremlin, since it increases oil and gas export earnings in ruble terms. For now the central bank is managing the rate as best it can after the shock of Gazprombank sanctions, said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Since there is no open market trading of the ruble on the Moscow or any other exchange due to sanctions, the rate is set by the central bank based on its estimate of trade requirements.",
      "\u201cThe market now is entirely under the control of the central bank, and they set the rates every evening based on what they see, the inflow of money coming from from Russians exporters and the demand for FX from companies who want to buy goods,\" said Weafer, using the abbreviation for foreign exchange.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, there there was this shock element of when Gazprombank was added to sanctions,\u201d he said. \"They have decided that the best course of action over the short term is to allow the ruble to weaken. And that is because it significantly helps the finance ministry.\u201d",
      "The central bank will have to juggle inflation and budget concerns and come up with the rate best suited to circumstances, said Weafer. One way of doing that would be to require exporters to change more of their foreign currency earnings to rubles: \u201cThey will have to put all of those factors together and come up with what they believe is the optimal rate.\""

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew to Florida on Friday to have dinner with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club after Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.",
      "Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don\u2019t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "A person familiar with the details called it a \"positive wide-ranging dinner that lasted three hours.\u201d The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said topics included trade, border security, fentanyl, defense, Ukraine, NATO, China and pipelines, as well as the the Group of Seven meeting in Canada next year.",
      "Although Trump once called Trudeau \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the G7 countries to visit Trump since the Nov. 4 election.",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives.",
      "Also at the dinner were David McCormick, just elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, and Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.",
      "McCormick posted a photo on X of the group seated at a round table on the patio of Mar-a-Lago. At the table behind the president-elect a boy can be seen mugging for the camera.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition did not respond to questions about what they had discussed or whether the conversation alleviated Trump\u2019s concerns about the border.",
      "A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday.",
      "Trudeau said earlier Friday that he would resolve the tariffs issue by talking to Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday after speaking with Trump that she is confident a tariff war with the United States will be averted.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to work together to meet some of the concerns,\u201d Trudeau told reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. \u201cBut ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.\u201d",
      "Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.",
      "\u201cIt is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "\u201cOur responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,\u201d he added.",
      "Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump\u2019s team negotiated during his initial term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a \u201cwin win\u201d for both countries.",
      "\u201cWe can work together as we did previously,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security.",
      "Trudeau called Trump after he made his social media posts on the border.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official told The Associated Press this week.",
      "A government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

      "Several states in Brazil are trying to rid themselves of rainforest protections, bowing to pressures from cattle ranchers and soybean growers to cut forest and expand agriculture as much as possible",
      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Several states in Brazil are trying to rid themselves of rainforest protections, bowing to pressure from cattle ranchers and soybean growers to cut down trees and expand agriculture.",
      "Their efforts run counter to those of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who returned to power last year and has made significant strides in curbing Amazon deforestation. They also threaten Brazil\u2019s commitment to halt deforestation by 2030. Loss of forest is the country\u2019s largest source of carbon emissions.",
      "\u201cWe are detecting a well-coordinated wave of setbacks. The efforts to reduce deforestation remain highly fragile in some regions,\u201d said Alice Thuault, executive director of Instituto Centro de Vida, an environmental nonprofit based in Mato Grosso state. A coalition of organizations that keeps watch on supply chains, the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi), also referred to the trend as \u201ca major setback.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s nine Amazonian states are crucial for preserving forest. Together, they manage almost 220,000 square miles (564,000 square kilometers) of conservation lands and 12,600 square miles (32,600 square kilometers) of public forests that have no protective designation, a total area roughly the size of Ukraine.",
      "In Acre state, a law approved unanimously in August allows the privatization of almost 347 square miles (900 square kilometers) of protected forest, an area approximately the size of New York City. The stated goal is to legalize the status of people who have illegally moved into five forested conservation units.",
      "The state and its leading farmers\u00b4 organizations are finding common cause with Brazil\u00b4s communist party and state lawmaker Edvaldo Magalh\u00e3es. In a speech in August, he said the new environmental legislation, which also lowers penalties for illegal deforestation, will benefit 40,000 small farmers. He said it will increase protected forest area, although he has not said how. Magalh\u00e3es didn't return requests for an interview.",
      "Acre\u2019s new legislation has garnered strong support from agribusiness organizations, which have long advocated for loosening rainforest protections. \u201cThe more forest, the more poverty,\u201d said Assuero Veronez, president of the Federation of Agriculture and Livestock of Acre, during a speech in the state parliament in April 2023.",
      "Veronez, a cattle rancher who migrated from Brazil\u2019s Southeast to Acre, argues that forests don't generate income and they occupy land that could be used for agriculture. \u201cThat hectare of forest \u2014 there is soil underneath it. If we cannot remove the forest, we cannot produce,\u201d he said.",
      "Veronez did not respond to requests for comment from the Associated Press.",
      "Passage of the legislation prompted Acre Environment Secretary Julie Messias to resign. \u201cThe new legislation poses serious risks and may not be constitutional,\" Messias said. It's crucial for people to get legal status, but that has to be done consistent with Brazil's laws on forest conservation, she said. Acre Governor Gladson Cameli signed the law, but delayed its implementation until January 1 to evaluate whether it is legally binding.",
      "The prospect that the protected areas in Acre could be privatized led to a surge in deforestation, according to a satellite image analysis requested by the AP from the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment. From August to October, illegal deforestation in four protected areas surged more than threefold over the year before, to roughly the area of six Central Parks.",
      "The damage was much worse in neighboring Rondonia state, where the Assembly and local government are in court seeking to annul 11 conservation units and reduce two others. In two of them alone, Guajara-Mirim and Soldado da Borracha, fires that were deliberately set destroyed a combined area of 668 square miles (1,730 square kilometers), an area slightly larger than Greater London, according to MapBiomas, a network of non-governmental organizations that monitors land use.",
      "Rondonia state prosecutor Pablo Viscardi said the fires are the work of people who want to gain legal title to the land. They \u201cuse forest fires to \u2018consolidate\u2019 the land-grabbing and/or prevent the regeneration of areas they were expelled from,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "In Rondonia and also in neighboring Mato Grosso, authorities have also ended an important piece of environmental legislation. In the historic Soy Moratorium of 2006, traders and oil producers agreed not to buy soy beans grown on recently deforested land. Environmental groups including Greenpeace and U.S. commodity giant companies Cargill, Bunge and ADM were parties. Now the laws in Mato Grosso, Brazil\u2019s largest soybean and beef-producing state, and Rondonia, force traders and oil producers to exit the agreement.",
      "Another Amazonian state, Para, is pushing a similar initiative. According to Directa, a law consulting company, the bill closely resembles the ones in Mato Grosso and Rondonia, suggesting a coordinated effort to undermine the soy moratorium.",
      "Critics of the moratorium, which include Brazil\u00b4s top soy producer associations, argue that the agreement is illegal because it goes beyond Brazil\u00b4s anti-deforestation laws. In a statement, the government of Mato Grosso said it ceased incentives under the soy moratorium because the state already enforces \u201cthe world\u2019s strictest environmental regulations\u201d and companies that violate national laws will face penalties, just as they would in other countries.",
      "Brazil is the world\u2019s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with almost 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by World Resources Institute. Almost half of Brazil\u2019s carbon emissions come from deforestation. The Amazon is a vital climate regulator, contains the most biodiverse forest in the world plus one-fifth of the world\u00b4s freshwater.",

      "Tommy Edman and the Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to a $74 million, five-year contract",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tommy Edman and the Los Angeles Dodgers agreed Friday to a $74 million, five-year contract.",
      "His new deal contains a team option for 2030 and includes $25 million deferred over 10 years. The agreement supersedes a $16.5 million, two-year contract he agreed to with St. Louis in February that had called for a $9.5 million salary in 2025.",
      "Edman was acquired from the Cardinals on July 29 as part of a three-team trade that included the Chicago White Sox. He hit .237 with six homers and 20 RBIs in 37 games and was MVP of the NL Championship Series, hitting .407 with 11 RBIs. He batted .320 with two homers and 13 RBIs during the postseason as the Dodgers won the World Series.",
      "The 29-year-old plays second base, shortstop and the outfield. He has a .263 average with 59 homers, 242 RBIs and 112 steals in six seasons with the Cardinals and Dodgers. He would have been eligible for free agency after the 2025 World Series.",

      "The Kansas City Chiefs recovered a botched snap while the Las Vegas Raiders were within range of a go-ahead field goal with 15 seconds remaining, preserving a 19-17 victory for Kansas City",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Kansas City Chiefs have made a habit of winning games in the most improbable of ways.",
      "The way they beat the Raiders on Friday still had Patrick Mahomes and Co. shaking their heads in disbelief.",
      "The two-time MVP watched from the sideline as Las Vegas drove within range of a winning field goal with 15 seconds left, only to botch the snap on its final offensive play, allowing the Chiefs to escape with a 19-17 victory that also secured their 10th consecutive playoff berth \u2014 the second-longest streak in NFL history.",
      "\u201cObviously a big stop in a big moment that got us the win,\u201d Mahomes said.",
      "The Raiders (2-10) had taken over at their own 8-yard line with just under two minutes to go, and quarterback Aidan O'Connell quickly moved them across midfield, eventually spiking the ball at the Kansas City 32 to stop the clock.",
      "Rather than try for the winning field goal \u2014 Daniel Carlson had missed three from 50-plus \u2014 the Raiders lined up to run a play, hoping to gain a few yards with a throw to the sideline before time expired. But amid the roar of Arrowhead Stadium, rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson snapped the ball when O'Connell wasn't expecting it, and it bounced off the QB's shoulder. Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton pounced on it, and the recovery stood when a flag on the play turned out to be an illegal shift by the Raiders.",
      "\u201cI actually didn't watch,\u201d Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said of the fateful play. \u201cThat last play there was a lot going on, from the officiating to the flags to the ball being snapped.\u201d",
      "Mahomes finished with 306 yards passing and a touchdown, and fill-in kicker Matt Wright made four field goals for the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs (11-1), who won their NFL record-extending 14th consecutive one-possession game.",
      "Like many of them, including last week's last-second win over Carolina, the Chiefs seemed to be in no mood to celebrate.",
      "\u201cI mean, we just hold ourselves to such a high standard. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re playing our best football,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cWe have to find a way to build up to play great (as) a full, entire team. It\u2019s awesome that we\u2019re finding ways to get wins. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going for. But our goal is to get to the Super Bowl.\u201d",
      "The Raiders had a chance to take the lead earlier in the fourth quarter, too, when O'Connell drove them across midfield. But the Chiefs forced three incompletions \u2014 George Karlaftis and Justin Reid batted down two \u2014 to bring up fourth down.",
      "Carlson headed onto the field, but his 58-yard try with 2:21 remaining never got near the uprights.",
      "O\u2019Connell finished with 340 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Raiders, who have lost eight of nine to their bitter AFC West rivals. Brock Bowers had 10 catches for 140 yards and one of the scores.",
      "\u201cThese guys battled until the very end, until the clock hit zero,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThey believed we were going to win and fought their (butts) off to the very end. All phases contributed to help us get in that position, but Aiden did hell of a job. He stayed in the pocket, made big-time throws for us, pushed the ball down the field. The numbers say what they\u2019re going to say. I\u2019m proud of my team, our team. I'm proud of the fight. We came up short yet again against the world champs. Twice now.\u201d",
      "The hapless Raiders were able to hang around thanks to the same problems that have plagued the Chiefs much of the season: Their offensive tackles were unable to give Mahomes time to throw, their secondary kept breaking down and they committed too many penalties \u2014 three on one offensive possession alone.",
      "In fact, Mahomes was under extreme duress when he found Justin Watson from 6 yards out late in the first half. The pass not only gave the Chiefs a 10-3 lead but sent the two-time MVP past Len Dawson with his franchise-record 328th TD throw.",
      "O'Connell, thrust back onto the field when Gardner Minshew broke his collarbone last weekend, got off to a slow start after missing a month with a broken thumb. But as the Chiefs continued to kick field goals, O'Connell found his rhythm, eventually slinging a pair of touchdown passes to give Las Vegas the lead.",
      "The first was to Bowers, already one of the most productive rookies in NFL history, with 1:40 left in the third quarter. Then, after the Chiefs went three-and-out, O'Connell hit Tre Tucker with 58-yard strike on the first play of the fourth quarter.",
      "The Chiefs answered with Wright's fourth field goal to take a 19-17 lead with about 10 minutes to go.",
      "A whole lot was still to transpire before that was the final score.",
      "\u201cThe win was a positive here. These things are hard to get, especially against this crew,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cThey do a nice job against us it seems every time we play them. It comes right down to the end.\u201d",
      "Chris Jones had two sacks for Kansas City. He had not had one the previous seven games. ... Las Vegas has trailed by double digits in every game this season. ... Mahomes had gone 113 straight starts without being sacked five-plus times. Carolina and Las Vegas have done it in consecutive weeks. ... The Raiders were officially eliminated from playoff contention.",
      "Raiders: WR DJ Turner left in the second half with a knee injury.",
      "The Raiders visit Tampa Bay on Dec. 8.",
      "The Chiefs welcome the Los Angeles Chargers the same night.",

      "One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character",
      "LONDON -- One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character.",
      "In Miami, observers say the Dwyane Wade sculpture looks more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the former basketball star. Of course, the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo bust in 2017 gave the chiseled soccer star a chubby face and goofy smile.",
      "A statue of Mohamed Salah in 2018 depicted the Liverpool star with a disproportionately large head. In 2011, a terracotta warrior statue of Andy Murray at a Shanghai tennis tournament drew chuckles, including from the star himself: \u201cI thought I was better looking than that.\"",
      "It wasn't always this way. In classical times, sculptors \u201chad absolutely no interest in depicting people accurately,\u201d explained Lucy Branch, a London-based sculptural conservator.",
      "\u201cWhat they ended up doing quite often, they recycled sculptures so when another athlete became more prominent, they just changed the name on the plaque,\u201d said Branch, host of the \u201cSculpture Vulture\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea now, in this era, that commemorative sculpture should be like portraiture \u2014 it should look exactly like the person they are commemorating. But actually that's a really new idea in sculpture.\"",
      "To avoid pitfalls, here are some tips from sculptors:",
      "London-based sculptor Hywel Pratley studied countless images of Queen Elizabeth II to create a memorial statue in the East Midlands town of Oakham.",
      "\u201cA good portrait sculpture is evidence of 1,000 decisions after 10,000 observations,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "In addition, Yorkshire county sculptor Steve Winterburn recommends getting close with a subject's family and friends to help find characteristics.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want it looking like a Madame Tussauds,\u201d said Winterburn, who created a statue of five Rugby League greats at Wembley Stadium. \u201cIt still needs a bit of art in it, a bit of soul. That\u2019s what makes art really sing.\u201d",
      "The Ronaldo bust depicted the Portugal star smiling crookedly. Likewise, the Salah sculpture features the Egyptian smiling while celebrating a goal. In Miami, Wade's mouth is open in the statue representing the moment the player famously jumped onto a courtside table and yelled \u201cThis is my house.\u201d",
      "It's probably best avoided.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to do teeth looking good in sculpture,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "Start \"by understanding the profile\" before moving on to determine widths from the front view, Pratley said.",
      "\u201cGet the profile right and you will have won half the battle, because then you can have something at least that you can trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re lost, you can say, \u2018well I knew where I was then,\u2019 \u2014 and you will get lost as a sculptor in the forms.",
      "\"There\u2019s so many to understand. It\u2019s not two dimensions, it\u2019s three. There\u2019s an exponential opportunity for everything to go wrong. If you\u2019ve got the profile, then you can go forward with more confidence.\u201d",
      "Winterburn tries to make the eyes \u201ccome alive\u201d in his work.",
      "\"The eye is the soul of the person that carries it,\" he said. \u201cIf you look at a lot of public work, I\u2019m not being funny, they\u2019re dead. There\u2019s nothing in them, they\u2019re just featureless, soulless. With a painting, if in doubt, fade it out. With sculpture, there is nowhere to hide.\"",
      "For Pratley, especially when he is working with a live model, \u201cI\u2019m often struck by how the absolute essence of somebody is somewhere between the nostrils and the mouth. The flicker of muscles and the subtle movement of muscles around the mouth is so much you \u2014 it\u2019s so much that person.\u201d",
      "Commemorative sculpture historically has been on plinths, Branch notes.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason for that is because we put our heroes on a pedestal,\" she said. \"The problem is, the lower to the ground the sculpture is, the more scrutiny it\u2019s going to get and the less it can get away with not looking quite right.\u201d",
      "The Kane sculpture features the England captain seated.",
      "\u201cBeing so low, people get to look at it incredibly closely,\u201d Branch said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get sculpture to be more with the people, but then that comes with its own problems.\u201d",
      "In the UK, local councils \u2014 like a city council in the US \u2014 might propose a project, fund it and select the sculptor, sometimes with little input from the public and limited vetting of artists.",
      "Branch says there's a better way: Vote on it.",
      "That's what happened for the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Manchester. A selection committee used an online platform to get public input and Hazel Reeves' proposal to honor the suffragette won.",
      "\u201cIt is a really good balance and check for whether people on the committees have chosen the right sculptor or the right composition for that person who is being commemorated,\u201d Branch said. \u201c(The public) may not necessarily be highly educated about sculpture, but they always tend to know whether the artist has hit the nail on the head.\u201d",

      "The lucrative constructors' championship is still wide open with McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull battling for the title. The contest for teams is worth around $140 million to the winner, though the precise payout depends on variables.",
      "This weekend in Qatar, a sprint race Saturday means extra points are on offer \u2014 a maximum of 59 for a team over the whole weekend.",
      "McLaren leads by 24 points from Ferrari, with Verstappen's Red Bull 29 further back. McLaren could seal its first constructors' crown since 1998 this Sunday, wrapping up the title ahead of the final round in Abu Dhabi next week, but would likely need either a perfect weekend or for Ferrari to encounter problems.",
      "McLaren's Lando Norris beat Mercedes' George Russell by just .063 of a second to take pole position Friday for the Saturday sprint race. Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri is third, .159 off the pace, ahead of the two Ferraris of Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc. Verstappen is sixth.",
      "\u201cGreat qualifying today, especially to bounce back from where we were last time out in Vegas,\u201d said Norris, whose title chances ended with a sixth-place finish behind Verstappen in Las Vegas. \u201cWe're coming here to get pole and we did that, so job done for today.\"",

      "The contributions of Piastri, who won the Qatar sprint race as a rookie last year, have been key to McLaren's hopes. Ferrari's Leclerc and Sainz have been close on the track \u2014 and sometimes too close for comfort \u2014 all year.",
      "Red Bull's Sergio Perez is the only driver at the top three teams without a race win this year and he's eighth in the standings with less than half of Verstappen\u2019s points total. Perez was 18th fastest in practice Friday and qualified 16th for the sprint, his latest dismal results.",
      "Perez, who has faced speculation over his future almost all year, says he's struggled to make the title-winning Red Bull car fit his driving style.",

      "Last year's race in Qatar pushed drivers to the limit. Esteban Ocon reported being sick as he battled the heat and humidity, while Lance Stroll said he was on the verge of losing consciousness.",
      "The FIA expressed concern that drivers \u201cshould not be expected to compete under conditions that could jeopardise their health or safety,\u201d and this month approved new driver cooling kits for hot races.",
      "Those kits aren't available until next year, but don't expect drivers to be clamouring for them in Qatar this week. With the action taking place in November and December instead of early October, much milder weather is forecast than last year, and Stroll said \u201cfor sure\u201d that's a relief.",

      "Georgia Tech (7-5) was powered by Haynes King, who ran for for three touchdowns and threw for two more. But the Yellow Jackets took their seventh straight loss to the Bulldogs on a frigid, excruciating night between the hedges.",
      "King passed for 303 yards and ran for 110 in a brilliant performance that wasn't quite enough.",
      "Frazier, a freshman, took a handoff from Beck and burst up the middle, sending fireworks into the sky above Sanford Stadium.",
      "It was the longest game in SEC history and just one overtime shy of the record for any FBS game \u2014 Illinois' 20-18 victory over Penn State in 2021 that went to nine extra periods.",
      "\u201cWe are a beat-up football team,\u201d Smart said. \u201cWe've got to get well.\u201d",
      "King scored on an 11-yard run to give Georgia Tech a seemingly comfortable 27-13 lead with 5:37 remaining, but the Bulldogs drove 75 yards in eight plays to give themselves a chance. Beck connected with Dominic Lovett on a 17-yard touchdown pass with 3:39 to go.",
      "Then, the Bulldogs\u2019 defense forced a huge turnover by King after struggling to contain the slithery quarterback most of the game. He kept it himself on third-and-1 \u2014 only to cough up the ball on a big hit by Dan Jackson.",
      "Chaz Chambliss recovered the fumble at the Yellow Jackets 32, and Beck quickly guided the Bulldogs to a tying touchdown on a 3-yard pass to Lovett with 1:01 left in regulation.",
      "Then, it was on to overtime -- and a game that just kept going and going.",
      "Beck and King threw matching touchdown passes followed by conventional extra points. Then it was King scoring on a 1-yard run, only to have Beck respond with a 25-yard scoring pass to Cash Jones. Both teams failed to convert their 2-point tries, so it came down to nothing but 2-point tries.",
      "Both teams converted in the fifth OT, but it was Frazier who finally ended it.",
      "\u201cThere's no moral victories,\u201d Georgia Tech coach Brent Key said, fighting back tears. \u201cBut I'm proud of those guys.\u201d",
      "The first half was an absolute stunner for the Bulldogs, who have long dominated the state rivalry known as \u201cClean, Old-Fashioned Hate.\u201d",
      "Georgia Tech raced to a lead that could have been even bigger, outgaining the Bulldogs 307-137 in total yards and nearly doubling up in time of possession in the opening half.",
      "King, who has battled shoulder issues, looked to be fully recovered as he guided the Yellow Jackets up and down the field. He scored on a 2-yard run and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jamal Haynes, who made a soaring leap to the pylon. The Yellow Jackets also got a 31-yard field goal from Aidan Birr.",
      "But Birr also clanked a 25-yard attempt off the left upright, and Georgia Tech squandered another scoring chance when Haynes was stuffed for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-1 at the Bulldogs 25.",
      "Even with those setbacks, Georgia Tech built its biggest lead over the Bulldogs since a 20-0 edge in the 2013 game -- when Georgia rallied for a 41-34 victory in double overtime.",
      "These Bulldogs did it again, extending their school-record home winning streak to 31 in a row.",
      "Georgia Tech: When Key took over this downtrodden program, he insisted the Yellow Jackets could compete with anyone \u2014 including their mighty state rival. This one will hurt for a while, but Georgia Tech showed it's on the verge of backing up his bold words after just two full seasons in charge. \u201cHe's done a tremendous job turning that program around,\u201d Smart said.",
      "Georgia: The Bulldogs aren't nearly as dominant as the team that won back-to-back national titles during the 2021 and 2022 seasons. They surrendered 563 yards to the Yellow Jackets, including 260 on the ground. But, amazingly, Smart's squad still has a shot at winning it all for the third time in four years.",
      "Georgia Tech: Awaits a second straight bowl invitation and another shot at its first eight-win season since 2016, which also was the last year they beat the Bulldogs.",
      "Georgia: Heads to the SEC championship game for the fourth straight season and seventh time in Smart\u2019s nine years as coach. The opponent will be the winner of Saturday night\u2019s game between Texas and Texas A&M.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- When three deep passes by Darian Mensah resulted in turnovers, Tulane's long-shot hopes of sneaking into the College Football Playoff slipped away.",
      "Greg Desrosiers Jr. caught two scoring passes and ran for a touchdown, and Memphis defeated No. 18 Tulane 34-24 on Thursday night to end the Green Wave's eight-game winning streak.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have the critical mistakes we had,\" said Tulane coach Jon Sumrall, whose team needed to win its regular-season finale and the American Athletic Conference title game to have any realistic chance at making the new 12-team CFP.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff we didn\u2019t execute to our standard that we have for several games in a row now,\" he added. \"It\u2019s very frustrating. We\u2019re all hurting, and it should hurt when you play a game like that.\u201d",
      "Two turnovers by Tulane (9-3, 7-1 AAC, No. 17 CFP) came on fumbles after long receptions at or inside the Memphis 10-yard line. Another came on a long pass by Mensah that was intercepted at the 2-yard line by Davion Ross, and the Tigers responded with a game-sealing drive capped by Mario Anderson Jr.\u2019s 47-yard touchdown run.",
      "\u201cWe could have easily held our heads down,\u201d Desrosiers said, referring to a pair of conference losses that dropped Memphis (10-2, 6-2) out of the AAC title picture. \u201cObviously, the season didn't go as planned ... but we know what we deserve. We know what we're capable of. So, we came out here and we wanted to dominate.\u201d",
      "Tigers defensive back Kourtlan Marsh caused both momentum-turning fumbles, the first when he leveled Yulkeith Brown after the receiver's 40-yard catch. AJ Watts recovered at the 10 and returned it 37 yards, initiating a drive that ended with Desrosiers' 29-yard touchdown run on third-and-4 to give Memphis a 27-10 lead.",
      "In the fourth quarter, with Tulane trailing 27-17, Mario Williams fumbled at the Tigers 9 after hauling in a 55-yard pass. Marsh recovered.",
      "\u201cIf those three turnovers don\u2019t happen, we\u2019re probably talking about a final play to figure out who the winner is,\" Sumrall said.",
      "Seth Henigan completed 22 of 29 passes for 218 yards and two TDs without a turnover for Memphis, which totaled 454 yards against a Tulane defense that had allowed just nine points in its previous three games combined. Anderson rushed for 177 yards on 24 carries.",
      "\u201cWhen you can't win the conference championship, all you can do is win the play that you're in and the game that you're in,\u201d Henigan said. \u201cOur guys came together and played for each other.\u201d",
      "Mensah passed for 317 yards and two TDs, and Arnold Barnes ran for a 2-yard score \u2014 not enough for Tulane to prolong its 17-game streak of regular-season conference wins.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see that performance coming,\u201d Sumrall said. \u201cI thought we\u2019d play better than we did. Memphis played good, but we didn\u2019t play to our standard. We didn\u2019t help ourselves a whole lot.\u201d",
      "Tulane gave up a touchdown on Memphis' opening drive when Henigan hit Desrosiers for the first of his two touchdown catches \u2014 a leaping 17-yard grab in tight coverage.",
      "\u201cTo come out on the opening possession and score, that was big for our offense and maybe our confidence as well, just to know we could execute on these guys,\u201d Henigan said. \u201cPlaying against a great opponent, that's an opportunity. So we had to make sure that opportunity wasn't wasted.\u201d",
      "Tulane's only lead came when Williams' 7-yard TD catch made it 10-7 late in the first quarter. Desrosier's 25-yard catch and run put the Tigers back in front for good in the second.",
      "Memphis: The Tigers played like a team that felt disrespected as two-touchdown underdogs. They converted 10 of 16 third downs to help them surpass 20 points for a 39th straight game. Their defense was disruptive and opportunistic. Now they have consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time in program history. Henigan also became the AAC's all-time leading passer, now with 13,972 career yards.",
      "Tulane: The Green Wave looked tight early. Receivers dropped several passes and Tulane's normally productive run scheme did not match up well with a Memphis run defense that ranked 18th nationally. Missed tackles on defense and trouble getting third-down stops made for a rough night.",
      "Tulane might drop out of the AP Top 25, lessening the magnitude of next week's AAC championship game.",
      "Memphis: Awaits a bowl bid.",
      "Tulane: Will play Army on Dec. 6 in the American Athletic Conference championship game at a site to be determined.",

      "The quarterback revitalization program the Minnesota Vikings have unofficially launched under coach Kevin O\u2019Connell has a new participant in Daniel Jones",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- The quarterback revitalization program the Minnesota Vikings have unofficially launched under coach Kevin O'Connell has a new participant: Daniel Jones.",
      "The sixth overall pick in the 2019 draft who requested his release by the New York Giants last week was signed to Minnesota's practice squad on Friday, after deciding to join a 9-2 team with an NFL -wide reputation for a player-friendly environment and a coach with a knack for quarterback development.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy last couple of weeks, for sure. Certainly a lot going on. At the end of the day, I\u2019m excited to be here. This is an awesome opportunity,\u201d Jones said after his first practice with the Vikings. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to learning the system and building relationships with these guys and helping the team.\u201d",
      "After going 24-44-1 as a starter, Jones was benched by the Giants, who are now 2-10. They had a clear eye on the $23 million guarantee for injury on his contract for 2025.",
      "After receiving an extension prior to the 2023 season that carried a $40 million annual average value, Jones won only three more games for New York. His performance in 2022, leading the Giants to the playoffs with a league-best interception rate and 708 rushing yards, precipitated their financial commitment. The game that sealed the deal, as it turned out, was a wild-card round playoff win at Minnesota in which he passed for 301 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 78 yards without a turnover.",
      "\u201cI may or may not have said to him this morning, \u2018Our team is really looking forward to getting back to U.S. Bank Stadium. I\u2019m sure you are too,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Connell said, reflecting on the sour end to his 13-4 rookie year. \u201cI remember that afternoon like it was yesterday.\u201d",
      "Two seasons later, Jones has landed back in quarterback school. Sam Darnold, another failed former New York quarterback who was drafted third overall by the Jets the year before Jones went to the Giants, has enjoyed a remarkable comeback in O'Connell's offense after rookie J.J. McCarthy, perceived to be the eventual franchise quarterback in Minnesota, went down with a preseason knee injury. Nick Mullens appears entrenched as the primary backup, with Brett Rypien behind him on the depth chart.",
      "If Jones were to get in a game yet this year, the Vikings would likely be in trouble. But with Darnold, Mullens and Rypien all on expiring contracts, they'll need a proven veteran in 2025 to pair with McCarthy as he returns from his rehab. Unlikely to get any starter-level contract offers next spring, Jones could fit that role well, even if he wasn't ready to address his future in an interview with reporters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re really doing two things at once: You\u2019re building a longer-term kind of foundation, but at the same time keeping a mindset on \u2014 if Daniel\u2019s called upon to play, we want to make sure we\u2019re not wasting time \u2014 on the present,\u201d O'Connell said.",
      "The onboarding process for Jones comes with plenty of homework.",
      "\u201cThese guys are game-planning, focusing on winning, so I don\u2019t want to slow anything down with that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s on me to catch up, to take the time outside of meetings, outside of practice, to learn it.\u201d",

      "The desire to prevail in this series is so strong that losing can sting for years \u2014 or in the case of Williams \u2014 decades. He ran for 750 yards and six touchdowns in four games against the Aggies, but instead of thinking about that success he dwells on the game he lost.",
      "Playing with a high ankle sprain for most of the second half, Williams finished with 183 yards and two touchdowns in a 27-16 A&M win in 1997.",

      "Texas leads the annual rivalry 76-37-5 and got it started by whipping the Aggies 38-0 in 1894. According to a newspaper account of the first game, A&M was thoroughly outclassed in defeat.",

      "The Aggies didn\u2019t beat Texas until 1902. The rivalry inspired Texas A&M\u2019s first pregame bonfire in 1909, which became an annual tradition until the log stack collapsed in 1999, killing 12 people and injuring dozens.",
      "Williams was the last Heisman winner to play in this series that has featured three.",
      "The first was Texas A&M\u2019s John David Crow, a running back who won the trophy in 1957. A year earlier he scored a touchdown as coach Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant led A&M to its first win at Texas\u2019 Memorial Stadium in 1956.",
      "The next year, first-year Texas coach Darrell Royal led the Longhorns to a win in College Station. The Longhorns\u2019 home stadium now bears his name.",
      "Crow is the only Texas A&M Heisman winner to play in the series. Johnny Manziel missed out on the rivalry with the Aggies saying, \u201cgoodbye to Texas University,\u201d as the Aggie War Hymn says, to move to the SEC in 2012 and halt the rivalry.",
      "Earl Campbell, who became the first Heisman winner at Texas in 1977, had the best game of his career by rushing for 222 yards and three touchdowns, and catching the only touchdown pass of his career, in a 57-28 win in 1977.",
      "Texas owned the rivalry from 1940-1974, going 31-3-1. It\u2019s been much more competitive since then, with A&M holding a 19-18 edge in the last 37 years of the rivalry. The Aggies\u2019 longest run of dominance came when they won 10 of 11 from 1984-94.",

      "Texas A&M\u2019s \u201cWrecking Crew\u201d defense was ranked first in the nation and tall tales told on campus made Williams, a native of San Diego, think the Aggies were all \u201c6-foot-5 and they all ran 4.2s. (40-yard dashes.)\u201d",
      "\u201cI was afraid,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI thought it was going to be a bloodbath and we were going be on the losing end of it.\u201d",

      "\u201cI grew up watching this game as a youngster in Texas and then coached in it 30 times,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a great rivalry. We\u2019re \u2026 two big schools in a big state that loves football. And so, it\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d",
      "The 1990s saw two of the most thrilling and emotionally wrenching games in the rivalry\u2019s history.",
      "In 1998, Williams broke the NCAA major college career rushing record in Texas\u2019 26-24 upset of the No. 6 Aggies.",
      "Williams surpassed Pittsburgh\u2019s Tony Dorsett with a 60-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, plowing over an Aggies defender at the goal line. But he fumbled twice after that run and the Longhorns needed a field goal in the final seconds to get the win.",
      "\u201cIt was wonderful that I broke the record and I got all the fame,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut I almost lost the game \u2026 so, what I remember most about my last collegiate regular season game against the Aggies was, it was the epitome of a team victory. And I think when you go into these big rivalry games, that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d",
      "Even in the loss, the Aggies helped celebrate Williams\u2019 Heisman-clinching game with Crow joining Dorsett and Campbell to present him with a game ball.",
      "Tragedy struck College Station in 1999 when the 40-foot tower of timber being assembled for the annual bonfire collapsed eight days before the game. Dozens of Aggies players rushed to the scene to help rescuers remove the heavy logs and Longhorns players held blood drives for the injured.",
      "Some questioned whether the game should be canceled, but in the end, it was played as scheduled. Slocum said that game, which the Aggies won 20-16, was his most meaningful.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d gone through so much here with that horrible tragedy and that game was one I felt more pressure than any game I ever coached that we really needed to win that game,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell the players that, but I felt it myself.\u201d",
      "Slocum said Texas was very sensitive to the situation and that then-Texas coach Mack Brown called him several time that week to discuss it. The Texas band played \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at halftime.",
      "\u201cIt was a good ball game, but it turned out like it needed to for our sake,\u201d Slocum said.",
      "Though the teams and their fans united after that tragedy, the fabric of this rivalry is in the disdain Texas and Texas A&M have had for each other for more than a century.",
      "The Aggie fight song calls to \u201csaw Varsity\u2019s horns off\u201d and the Longhorns for decades held a pregame candlelight \u201cHex Rally\u201d as one of the more unique ways of gaining an upper hand.",
      "Texas has had bragging rights for the last 13 years after knocking off the Aggies 27-25 on a last-second field goal at Kyle Field in the last meeting.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got to A&M you obviously grow more hate or hatred against Texas, especially on that day or leading up to that week,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cAnd I have tons of friends that went to Texas and I don\u2019t hate anybody, it\u2019s just about that one game.\u201d",
      "Neil believes nothing matters more to Texas A&M than this game.",
      "\u201cThey live to beat Texas. For an Aggie, that game is everything,\u201d Neil said.",
      "And if Texas wins Saturday?",
      "\u201cThat will drive Aggies insane. They may implode. They are about as hot as you can imagine for this one.\u201d",

      "Travis Hunter strengthened his Heisman hopes with three touchdown catches and an interception as No. 23 Colorado routed Oklahoma State 52-0 to keep its outside Big 12 title game hopes afloat",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- The final play on Travis Hunter\u2019s Heisman highlight reel was a falling touchdown catch with a defender draped all over him.",
      "If that, along with his other two touchdowns and an interception, wasn't enough to wrap up college football's biggest prize, then his coach has no idea what else the two-way standout can do.",
      "\u201cTravis clinched the Heisman today with his performance,\u201d Deion Sanders said after No. 23 Colorado routed Oklahoma State 52-0 on Friday to keep its outside Big 12 title game hopes afloat.",
      "Hunter finished with 10 receptions and 116 yards for the bowl-bound Buffaloes (9-3, 7-2, No. 25 CFP). His three touchdown catches gives him 14 on the year and moves him past Nelson Spruce (12 TDs, 2014) for the most by a Colorado receiver in a single season. After his third touchdown catch, Hunter got up and struck the Heisman pose.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the best player in college football. You can find ways to hate, criticize and condemn him and you won't come out of that looking professional,\" his coach said. \"Travis Hunter proved today, and he's proved every week, that he is the best player in college football.\u201d",
      "The same sentiment was held by his quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who at one point ran down the field counting out the star receiver's number of touchdowns for the day on his fingers.",
      "\u201cThere's no argument at this point,\u201d the QB said of Hunter's Heisman chances. \u201cThe consistency he has, I feel like that is what the award is about.\u201d",
      "Sanders had his own big day, throwing for 438 yards to break the school\u2019s single-season passing record. He closes the regular season with 3,926 yards passing to top the single-season mark turned in by Koy Detmer (3,527) in 1996. Sanders also added five TD passes to increase his total to a school-best 35 for the season.",
      "Their work done, the Buffaloes need chaos to unfold across the conference Saturday to earn a place in the league's championship contest on Dec. 7 in Arlington, Texas.",
      "One scenario to get in requires two losses out of either No. 14 Arizona State (at Arizona), No. 19 BYU (hosting Houston) or No. 17 Iowa State (hosting Kansas State). Another other scenario would be a loss by BYU and a win from Texas Tech (hosting West Virginia).",
      "\u201cLook at how we rebounded,\" said Deion Sanders, whose team lost control of their conference title-game fate with a 37-21 loss at Kansas last weekend. \u201cLook at how we wiped our tears and got back up, got on the horse and yell, \u2018Giddy-up.\u2019\"",
      "The Buffaloes jumped out to a 21-0 in the first quarter and kept rolling in the second half. The defense forced four turnovers, including a pick-6 by DJ McKinney. This was the Buffaloes first shutout since a 34-0 win over Arizona on Oct. 16, 2021.",
      "LaJohntay Wester finished with 11 catches for 175 yards and two scores. His 322 career catches with Colorado and Florida Atlantic ties him for sixth on the NCAA\u2019s career receptions list.",
      "Before the game, Sanders was named the winner of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation's top QB. It may be the first of numerous awards that Sanders and Hunter might collect.",
      "Hunter, though, wasn\u2019t named a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award as one of the top defensive backs, drawing the wrath of coach Deion Sanders. Hunter had one of his easiest picks when Maealiuaki Smith tossed up a pass in the first quarter. He dropped another and stared at his hands.",
      "Oklahoma State ended the year on a nine-game skid after being picked to finish third in the preseason media poll. This marked the Cowboys\u2019 first winless conference season since 1994 when they were in the Big 8.",
      "\u201cThat one didn\u2019t turn out the way we wanted it to,\u201d Cowboys coach Mike Gundy said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to look at the stat sheet, but we didn\u2019t really give ourselves a chance on offense. It was so bad it would be hard to point something out.\u201d",
      "Shedeur and Shilo Sanders were among the 21 players honored on senior day. The brothers were escorted to midfield by their coach/father.",
      "Oklahoma State: On Friday, receiver Brennan Presley became the only player in program history to notch four seasons with 1,000 all-purpose yards.",
      "Colorado: After allowing 331 yards rushing last weekend to Kansas, the Buffaloes held the Cowboys to 70 \u2014 and most after the game was decided.",
      "Colorado can climb back into the \u201cteens\u201d depending on what happens Saturday.",
      "Oklahoma State: Get ready for next season.",
      "Colorado: Awaits a bowl bid, possible a spot in the Big 12 title game.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Navy is making progress in deploying its first shipborne hypersonic weapon",
      "The U.S. Navy is transforming a costly flub into a potent weapon with the first shipborne hypersonic weapon, which is being retrofitted aboard the first of its three stealthy destroyers.",
      "The USS Zumwalt is at a Mississippi shipyard where workers have installed missile tubes that replace twin turrets from a gun system that was never activated because it was too expensive. Once the system is complete, the Zumwalt will provide a platform for conducting fast, precision strikes from greater distances, adding to the usefulness of the warship.",
      "\u201cIt was a costly blunder but the Navy could take victory from the jaws of defeat here, and get some utility out of them by making them into a hypersonic platform,\u201d said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute.",
      "The U.S. has had several types of hypersonic weapons in development for the past two decades, but recent tests by both Russia and China have added pressure to the U.S. military to hasten their production.",
      "Hypersonic weapons travel beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, with added maneuverability making them harder to shoot down.",
      "Last year, The Washington Post reported that among the documents leaked by former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was a defense department briefing that confirmed China had recently tested an intermediate-range hypersonic weapon called the DF-27. While the Pentagon had previously acknowledged the weapon's development, it had not recognized its testing.",
      "One of the U.S. programs in development and planned for the Zumwalt is \u201cConventional Prompt Strike.\" It would launch like a ballistic missile and then release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would travel at speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. The weapon system is being developed jointly by the Navy and Army. Each of the Zumwalt-class destroyers would be equipped with four missile tubes, each with three of the missiles for a total of 12 hypersonic weapons per ship.",
      "In choosing the Zumwalt, the Navy is attempting to add to the usefulness of a $7.5 billion warship that is considered by critics to be an expensive mistake despite serving as a test platform for multiple innovations.",
      "The Zumwalt was envisioned as providing land-attack capability with an Advanced Gun System with rocket-assisted projectiles to open the way for Marines to charge ashore. But the system featuring 155 mm guns hidden in stealthy turrets was canceled because each of the rocket-assisted projectiles cost between $800,000 and $1 million.",
      "Despite the stain on its reputation, the three Zumwalt-class destroyers remain the Navy\u2019s most advanced surface warship in terms of new technologies. Those innovations include electric propulsion, an angular shape to minimize radar signature, an unconventional wave-piercing hull, automated fire and damage control and a composite deckhouse that hides radar and other sensors.",
      "The Zumwalt arrived at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in August 2023 and was removed from the water for the complex work of integrating the new weapon system. It is due to be undocked this week in preparation for the next round of tests and its return to the fleet, shipyard spokeswoman Kimberly Aguillard said.",
      "A U.S. hypersonic weapon was successfully tested over the summer and development of the missiles is continuing. The Navy wants to begin testing the system aboard the Zumwalt in 2027 or 2028, according to the Navy.",
      "The U.S. weapon system will come at a steep price. It would cost nearly $18 billion to buy 300 of the weapons and maintain them over 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Critics say there is too little bang for the buck.",
      "\u201cThis particular missile costs more than a dozen tanks. All it gets you is a precise non-nuclear explosion, some place far far away. Is it really worth the money? The answer is most of the time the missile costs much more than any target you can destroy with it,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a longtime military analyst in Washington, D.C.",
      "But they provide the capability for Navy vessels to strike an enemy from a distance of thousands of kilometers \u2014 outside the range of most enemy weapons \u2014 and there is no effective defense against them, said retired Navy Rear Adm. Ray Spicer, CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute, a think tank, and former commander of an aircraft carrier strike force.",
      "Conventional missiles that cost less aren\u2019t much of a bargain if they are unable to reach their targets, Spicer said, adding the U.S. military really has no choice but to pursue them.",
      "\u201cThe adversary has them. We never want to be outdone,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. is accelerating development because hypersonics have been identified as vital to U.S. national security with \u201csurvivable and lethal capabilities,\u201d said James Weber, principal director for hypersonics in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Critical Technologies.",
      "\u201cFielding new capabilities that are based on hypersonic technologies is a priority for the defense department to sustain and strengthen our integrated deterrence, and to build enduring advantages,\u201d he said."

      "British lawmakers have given initial approval to a bill that would help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales",
      "LONDON -- British lawmakers gave initial approval on Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales, following an impassioned debate that saw people sharing personal stories of loss and suffering.",
      "Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote.",
      "Friday's vote came after hours of debate \u2014 emotional at times \u2014 that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,\u201d the bill\u2019s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber.",
      "Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable.",
      "Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative.",
      "The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards.",
      "They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland.",
      "Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance.",
      "Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a \u201cstate suicide service.\" He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives.",
      "Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future.",
      "\u201cI still think we can stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide.",
      "The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties.",
      "Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the \u201cwonderful\u201d outcome and said it will give people an \u201cequal choice.\u201d",
      "When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents.",

      "Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam.",
      "Mac Holdsworth died last year at his Melbourne family home at the age of 17 after a 47-year-old Sydney man who purported to be an 18-year-old woman demanded money for an intimate image the boy had shared.",
      "Since then, the grieving father has taken his tragic story to around 20 schools to warn students of the risks of social media.",
      "\u201cI saw firsthand the damage that social media could do. I saw Mac, my son, get sexually extorted on social media,\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cHis mental health deteriorated at a rapid rate.\u201d",
      "Online predators began approaching the teenager before his 16th birthday and his father believes such a ban could have saved his life.",
      "Australia's House of Representatives on Wednesday voted for such a ban and the Senate is expected to make it law soon.",
      "Holdsworth said most of the 3,000 students he\u2019s spoken to, from age 12 to 17, agree with a ban on children under the age of 16.",
      "\u201cThey come up to me and they say, \u2018I\u2019m so glad that this is going to be implemented,\u2019\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cEven the kids see it now that they\u2019re going to be protected from those predators outside that are preying on them.\u201d",
      "He said three girls approached him after a school address on Monday to tell him that they were being subjected to sextortion. One had already handed over 2,500 Australian dollars ($1,600) of her parents\u2019 money to a blackmailer.",
      "Holdsworth said he was the first adult they had confided in.",
      "\u201cThe parent won\u2019t know until the credit card statement comes out,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s prevalent. It happened last night and it\u2019ll happen tonight,\u201d he added.",
      "Holdsworth described the government plan to ban children younger than 16 from social media as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "But not all parents are convinced that banning young children from social media is the answer.",
      "Critics say the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "They also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encounter, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent Sydney lawmaker Kylea Tink on Tuesday became the first member of the House of Representatives to speak publicly against the bill, which would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cAs a mom of three young adults ... I\u2019m very aware of the negative impacts of social media and the challenges of parenting in this digital world,\u201d Tink told Parliament. \u201cI also recognize, however, that my children are digital natives and are very literate about how these platforms work. For this reason, I encourage everyone involved in this debate to ensure they are listening to the voices of young Australians when it comes to this decision-making process rather than assuming that the grownups in the room know best.\u201d",
      "Tink was among 13 lawmakers who voted against the bill in the House on Wednesday. They were overwhelmed by 102 legislators who voted for it.",
      "The platforms have urged a Senate committee that examined the legislation on Monday to delay a vote until after a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed next June.",
      "The four-hour committee meeting on Monday attracted 15,000 written submissions.",
      "X Corp. told the committee that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's platform had \u201cserious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,\" including its compatibility with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,\u201d X said.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation was \u201cinconsistent with what Australian parents have told us that they want, which is a simple and effective way for them to set controls and manage their teens\u2019 online experience.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, parental consent for children to use social media does not override the ban.",
      "Lizzie O\u2019Shea, chair of the Digital Rights Watch charity, which aims to uphold the digital rights of Australians, said she was appalled by the process and limited timeframe the government used to pass such significant and contentious legislation.",
      "She said she was very aware of the serious risks posed by social media platforms, \"but I do not support a ban personally because I understand both the limits of that particular policy and the expert evidence that is coming out from people who work in this space about the problems for young people being excluded from those spaces,\u201d O'Shea said.",
      "Her concerns centered on privacy, negative mental health impacts on excluded children and the possibility that young children would find ways to access social media spaces that would become even less child friendly as a result of the ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m profoundly aware of the dangers of large social media platforms running a certain kind of business model that prioritizes data extraction and exploitation of vulnerability over the public interest or the building of community and the protection of democracy,\" she said.",
      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet, who supports the ban, feels she is part of a minority among professionals in the digital field.",
      "\u201cI like it mainly because I think many of the social media platforms as they exist right now are not suitable environments for young children,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- Using fossilized feces and vomit samples from Poland, scientists have reconstructed how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth millions of years ago.",
      "Researchers aren't sure whether dinosaurs' rise over the course of 30 million years happened because of luck, skill, climate or some combination. But they came away knowing this: \u201cIt was not a sudden thing,\u201d said study co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m from Uppsala University.",
      "The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, analyzed hundreds of dino droppings to reconstruct who was eating whom 200 million years ago.",
      "The first dinosaurs were go-getters, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said, eating whatever they could \u2014 including insects, fish and plants.",
      "When climate conditions changed, they were quick to adapt. Plant-eating dinosaurs, for example, ate a greater variety of greens than other vegetarians of the time, so it was easier to expand their palates when wetter conditions gave rise to new plant species.",
      "Since the study\u2019s findings were limited to Polish fossils, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said he\u2019d like to see if their ideas hold steady against fossil records from around the world.",
      "It's not uncommon for scientists to study ancient fecal matter to understand creatures of the past, said Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. But fossilized feces can resemble blobs or chunks of rock, and they are not always found near fossils of the animal that made them \u2014 which makes it hard for scientists to know where they came from.",

      "The federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized safeguards for artificial intelligence to one more focused on eliminating red tape",
      "WASHINGTON -- With artificial intelligence at a pivotal moment of development, the federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized AI safeguards to one more focused on eliminating red tape.",
      "That\u2019s a promising prospect for some investors but creates uncertainty about the future of any guardrails on the technology, especially around the use of AI deepfakes in elections and political campaigns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but the platform of the Republican National Committee, which he recently reshaped, said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an open question whether Congress, soon to be fully controlled by Republicans, will be interested in passing any AI-related legislation. Interviews with a dozen lawmakers and industry experts reveal there is still interest in boosting the technology\u2019s use in national security and cracking down on non-consensual explicit images.",
      "Yet the use of AI in elections and in spreading misinformation is likely to take a backseat as GOP lawmakers turn away from anything they view as potentially suppressing innovation or free speech.",
      "\u201cAI has incredible potential to enhance human productivity and positively benefit our economy,\u201d said Rep. Jay Obernolte, a California Republican widely seen as a leader in the evolving technology. \u201cWe need to strike an appropriate balance between putting in place the framework to prevent the harmful things from happening while at the same time enabling innovation.\u201d",
      "Artificial intelligence interests have been expecting sweeping federal legislation for years. But Congress, gridlocked on nearly every issue, failed to pass any artificial intelligence bill, instead producing only a series of proposals and reports.",
      "Some lawmakers believe there is enough bipartisan interest around some AI-related issues to get a bill passed.",
      "\u201cI find there are Republicans that are very interested in this topic,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, singling out national security as one area of potential agreement. \"I am confident I will be able to work with them as I have in the past.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how much Republicans want the federal government to intervene in AI development. Few showed interest before this year's election in regulating how the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission handled AI-generated content, worrying that it would raise First Amendment issues at the same time that Trump\u2019s campaign and other Republicans were using the technology to create political memes.",
      "The FCC was in the middle of a lengthy process for developing AI-related regulations when Trump won the presidency. That work has since been halted under long-established rules covering a change in administrations.",
      "Trump has expressed both interest and skepticism in artificial intelligence.",
      "During a Fox Business interview earlier this year, he called the technology \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201cso scary\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no real solution.\u201d But his campaign and supporters also embraced AI-generated images more than their Democratic opponents. They often used them in social media posts that weren\u2019t meant to mislead, but rather to further entrench Republican political views.",
      "Elon Musk, Trump's close adviser and a founder of several companies that rely on AI, also has shown a mix of concern and excitement about the technology, depending on how it is applied.",
      "Musk used X, the social media platform he owns, to promote AI-generated images and videos throughout the election. Operatives from Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on artificial intelligence, have publicly been pushing Trump to tap Musk as his top adviser on the technology.",
      "\u201cWe think that Elon has a pretty sophisticated understating of both the opportunities and risks of advanced AI systems,\u201d said Doug Calidas, a top operative from the group.",
      "But Musk advising Trump on artificial intelligence worries others. Peters argued it could undercut the president.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d said the Michigan Democrat. \u201cWhenever you have anybody that has a strong financial interest in a particular technology, you should take their advice and counsel with a grain of salt.\u201d",
      "In the run-up to the election, many AI experts expressed concern about an eleventh-hour deepfake \u2014 a lifelike AI image, video or audio clip \u2014 that would sway or confuse voters as they headed to the polls. While those fears were never realized, AI still played a role in the election, said Vivian Schiller, executive director of Aspen Digital, part of the nonpartisan Aspen Institute think tank.",
      "\u201cI would not use the term that I hear a lot of people using, which is it was the dog that didn\u2019t bark,\u201d she said of AI in the 2024 election. \u201cIt was there, just not in the way that we expected.\u201d",
      "Campaigns used AI in algorithms to target messages to voters. AI-generated memes, though not lifelike enough to be mistaken as real, felt true enough to deepen partisan divisions.",
      "A political consultant mimicked Joe Biden\u2019s voice in robocalls that could have dissuaded voters from coming to the polls during New Hampshire's primary if they hadn\u2019t been caught quickly. And foreign actors used AI tools to create and automate fake online profiles and websites that spread disinformation to a U.S. audience.",
      "Even if AI didn\u2019t ultimately influence the election outcome, the technology made political inroads and contributed to an environment where U.S. voters don\u2019t feel confident that what they are seeing is true. That dynamic is part of the reason some in the AI industry want to see regulations that establish guidelines.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and people on his team have said they don\u2019t want to stifle the technology and they do want to support its development, so that is welcome news,\u201d said Craig Albright, the top lobbyist and senior vice president at The Software Alliance, a trade group whose members include OpenAI, Oracle and IBM. \u201cIt is our view that passing national laws to set the rules of the road will be good for developing markets for the technology.\"",
      "AI safety advocates during a recent meeting in San Francisco made similar arguments, according to Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Tech Responsibility at Brown University.",
      "\u201cBy putting literal guardrails, lanes, road rules, we were able to get cars that could roll a lot faster,\u201d said Venkatasubramanian, a former Biden administration official who helped craft White House principles for approaching AI.",
      "Rob Weissman, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said he's not hopeful about the prospects for federal legislation and is concerned about Trump\u2019s pledge to rescind Biden\u2019s executive order, which created an initial set of national standards for the industry. His group has advocated for federal regulation of generative AI in elections.",
      "\u201cThe safeguards are themselves ways to promote innovation so that we have AI that\u2019s useful and safe and doesn\u2019t exclude people and promotes the technology in ways that serve the public interest,\u201d he said.",

      "Most operating systems, especially those for mobile devices and their app stores, typically have auto-updates turned on by default. Be sure to double-check the device to make sure it has enough storage space to carry out the update. (More on this below.)",

      "\u2014 Use the cloud to back up media: iPhone users can free up space occupied by songs and pictures by storing them on iCloud. Android users can use the Google Photos app to back up and store their photos on their user space.",

Over time, these bits take up a significant amount of storage space on mobile devices and home computers. So cleaning caches out periodically helps free up space and, in some cases, improves system performance.",

So as you help your relatives reset some of theirs, you may be tempted to recycle some to keep things simple for them. But that's one of the bad password habits that cybersecurity experts warn against.",
      "Instead, try introducing your forgetful family member to a password manager. They're useful tools for simplifying and keeping track of logins. And if you want to impress a more tech-savvy cousin or auntie, you could suggest switching to a more secure digital authentication method: passkeys.",
      "As scammers find new ways to steal money and personal information, you and your family should be more vigilant about who to trust. Artificial intelligence and other technologies are giving bad actors craftier tools to work with online.",

So-called romance scams target lonely and isolated individuals. Quiz scams target those who spend a lot of time on social media.",

      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms have one year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation had been \u201crushed.\u201d",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the platforms in Australia, said questions remain about the law\u2019s impact on children, its technical foundations and scope.",
      "\u201cThe social media ban legislation has been released and passed within a week and, as a result, no one can confidently explain how it will work in practice \u2013 the community and platforms are in the dark about what exactly is required of them,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said.",
      "The amendments passed on Friday bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.",
      "\u201cThis policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate.",
      "Exemptions will apply for health and education services including YouTube, Messenger Kids, WhatsApp, Kids Helpline and Google Classroom.",
      "Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. \u201cThe core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,\u201d Kovacic told the Senate.",
      "\u201cThis is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,\u201d she added.",
      "Online safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, whose 15-year-old daughter Carly was murdered by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online, described the Senate vote as a \u201cmonumental moment in protecting our children from horrendous harms online.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late for my daughter, Carly, and the many other children who have suffered terribly and those who have lost their lives in Australia, but let us stand together on their behalf and embrace this together,\u201d she said.",
      "Wayne Holdsworth, whose teenage son Mac took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, had advocated for the age restriction and took pride in its passage.",
      "\u201cI have always been a proud Australian, but for me subsequent to today\u2019s Senate decision, I am bursting with pride,\u201d Holdsworth said.",
      "Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, the governing body for the suicide prevention sector, said the legislation failed to consider positive aspects of social media in supporting young people\u2019s mental health and sense of connection.",
      "\u201cThe government is running blindfolded into a brick wall by rushing this legislation. Young Australians deserve evidence-based policies, not decisions made in haste,\u201d Stone said.",
      "The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.",
      "\u201cNaturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,\" Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said. \u201cHowever, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.\u201d",
      "Snapchat said it was also concerned by the law and would cooperate with the government regulator, the eSafety Commissioner.",
      "\"While there are many unanswered questions about how this law will be implemented in practice, we will engage closely with the Government and the eSafety Commissioner during the 12-month implementation period to help develop an approach that balances privacy, safety and practicality. As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia,\u201d Snapchat said in a statement.",
      "Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents\u2019 concerns about their children\u2019s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children.",
      "Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.",

      "Much of the following states are best positioned for potential auroras: Washington, Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Maine. Northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire may also see auroras.",
      "Space weather experts say auroras could be visible from 10 p.m. EST Thursday to 1 a.m. Friday EST, though it's difficult to pin down an exact window. Updated forecasts may be available as the event draws closer on NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Muddy footprints left on a Kenyan lakeside suggest two of our early human ancestors were nearby neighbors some 1.5 million years ago.",
      "The footprints were left in the mud by two different species \u201cwithin a matter of hours, or at most days,\u201d said paleontologist Louise Leakey, co-author of the research published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Scientists previously knew from fossil remains that these two extinct branches of the human evolutionary tree \u2013 called Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei \u2013 lived about the same time in the Turkana Basin.",
      "But dating fossils is not exact. \u201cIt\u2019s plus or minus a few thousand years,\u201d said paleontologist William Harcourt-Smith of Lehman College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Yet with fossil footprints, \u201cthere\u2019s an actual moment in time preserved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing discovery.\u201d",
      "The tracks of fossil footprints were uncovered in 2021 in what is today Koobi Fora, Kenya, said Leaky, who is based at New York's Stony Brook University.",
      "Whether the two individuals passed by the eastern side of Lake Turkana at the same time \u2013 or a day or two apart \u2013 they likely knew of each other\u2019s existence, said study co-author Kevin Hatala, a paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.",
      "\u201cThey probably saw each other, probably knew each other was there and probably influenced each other in some way,\u201d he said.",
      "Scientists were able to distinguish between the two species because of the shape of the footprints, which holds clues to the anatomy of the foot and how it\u2019s being used.",
      "H. erectus appeared to be walking similar to how modern humans walk \u2013 striking the ground heel first, then rolling weight over the ball of the foot and toes and pushing off again.",
      "The other species, which was also walking upright, was moving \u201cin a different way from anything else we\u2019ve seen before, anywhere else,\u201d said co-author Erin Marie Williams-Hatala, a human evolutionary anatomist at Chatham.",
      "Among other details, the footprints suggest more mobility in their big toe, compared to H. erectus or modern humans, said Hatala.",
      "Our common primate ancestors probably had hands and feet adapted for grasping branches, but over time the feet of human ancestors evolved to enable walking upright, researchers say.",
      "The new study adds to a growing body of research that implies this transformation to bipedalism \u2013 walking on two feet \u2014 didn\u2019t happen at a single moment, in a single way.",
      "Rather, there may have been a variety of ways that early humans learned to walk, run, stumble and slide on prehistoric muddy slopes.",
      "\u201cIt turns out, there are different gait mechanics \u2013 different ways of being bipedal,\u201d said Harcourt-Smith.",

      "LONDON -- British lawmakers are expected to vote Friday on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives.",
      "The contentious bill would allow adults expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided with help to end their life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",
      "A vote in favor of the bill would send it to another round of hearings. A vote against it would kill it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "The House of Commons hasn't debated an assisted dying bill since 2015 when a similar measure failed.",
      "Debate is scheduled for five hours and more than 150 members have reportedly signed up to speak. It is expected to be followed by a close vote.",
      "Although the current bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it is an open vote with no pressure from the government on supporting it.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet have said they will support the bill, while others are against it.",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament.",
      "If ultimately approved, any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years, supporters say.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, only those over 18 years old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Someone who helps a person end their life can be prosecuted and face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",
      "\u201cThis is such a vital life and death issue, one that we the public care desperately about,\u201d Rantzen said in a public letter. \u201cIt is only right that as many MPs as possible listen to the arguments for and against, and make up your own minds, according to your own conscience, your personal thoughts and feelings.\u201d",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances."

      "The Justice Department and Google have made their closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google made closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off parts of its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "During three hours of arguments Monday, Brinkema, who sometimes tips her hand during legal arguments, did little to indicate how she might rule. She did, though, question the applicability of a key antitrust case Google cites in its defense.",

      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls as little as 10% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",

      "\u201cRequiring a company to do further engineering work to make its technology and customers accessible by all of its competitors on their preferred terms has never been compelled by U.S. antitrust law,\u201d the company wrote.",
      "Brinkema, during Monday's arguments, also sought clarity on Google\u2019s market share, a number the two sides dispute, depending on how broadly the market is defined.",
      "Historically, courts have been unwilling to declare an illegal monopoly in markets in which a company holds less than a 70% market share. Google says that when online display advertising is viewed as a whole, it holds only a 10% market share, and dwindling.",
      "The Justice Department contends, though, that when focusing on open-web display advertising, Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertiser ad networks.",
      "Google says that the \u201copen web display advertising\u201d market is gerrymandered by the Justice Department to make Google look bad, and that nobody in the industry looks at that category of ads without considering the ability of advertisers to switch to other forms of advertising, like in mobile apps.",
      "The Justice Department also contends that the public is harmed by the excessive rates Google charges to facilitate ad purchases, saying the company takes 36 cents on the dollar when it facilitates the transaction end to end.",
      "Google says its \u201ctake rate\u201d has dropped to 31% and continues to decrease, and it says that rate is lower than that of its competitors.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an integrated system, one of the benefits is lower prices,\" Google lawyer Karen Dunn said Monday.",

      "For the second straight day, Drake has taken legal action against Universal Music Group, this time in Texas, over Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "It follows a similar filing in New York on Monday, in which Drake alleges UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on Spotify and other streaming services.",
      "The two court moves have taken the bitter beef between the two hip-hop superstars to a whole new level, with the parent company of the labels for both men now pulled directly into the fight.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing in Bexar County alleges UMG engaged in \u201cirregular and inappropriate business practices\" to get radio airplay for \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d including making illegal payments to San Antonio-based iHeartMedia. The petition, a precursor to a potential lawsuit, seeks depositions from corporate representatives of both companies.",
      "The filing takes aim at UMG for allegedly knowing that \u201cthe song itself, as well as its accompanying album art and music video, attacked the character of another one of UMG\u2019s most prominent artists, Drake, by falsely accusing him of being a sex offender, engaging in pedophilic acts, harboring sex offenders, and committing other criminal sexual acts.\u201d",
      "The filing points out that \"the song calls Drake a \u2018certified pedophile,\u2019 a \u2018predator,\u2019 and someone whose name should \u2018be registered and placed on neighborhood watch.\u2019\"",
      "The petition says Drake could sue UMG for defamation, among other claims.",
      "A UMG representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the new filing. In a Monday statement in response to the New York filing, the company said the \u201csuggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns.\"",
      "An email to an iHeartMedia representative seeking comment was also not immediately answered.",
      "The New York petition is also a precursor to a potential lawsuit, and alleges UMG fired employees seen as loyal to Drake \u201cin an apparent effort to conceal its schemes.\u201d",
      "The back-to-back legal maneuvers represent a major and possibly unprecedented escalation of a hip-hop feud, especially with the label representing two of the biggest stars in music sitting at the center of it.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who is set to headline the next Super Bowl halftime, were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago.",
      "That changed when Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year.",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the wildly popular Lamar single released in May, was an especially vicious moment in a flurry of dueling tracks from the two artists."

      "An advocate for major social media platforms has told Australia's Parliament that a plan to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed rather than being rushed to approval this week",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An advocate for major social media platforms told an Australian Senate committee Monday that laws to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed until next year at least instead of being rushed through the Parliament this week.",
      "Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, was answering questions at a single-day Senate committee hearing into world-first legislation that was introduced into the Parliament last week.",
      "Bose said the Parliament should wait until the government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed in June.",
      "\u201cParliament is asked to pass a bill this week without knowing how it will work,\u201d Bose said.",
      "The legislation would impose fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) on platforms for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "It seems likely to be passed by Parliament by Thursday with the support of the major parties.",
      "It would take effect a year after the bill becomes law, allowing the platforms time to work out technological solutions that would also protect users\u2019 privacy.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said she looked forward to reading the Senate committee's assessment of the proposed law, which \u201csupports parents to say \u2018no\u2019\u201d to children wanting to use social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media in its current form is not a safe product for them,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cAccess to social media does not have to be the defining feature of growing up. There is more to life than constant notifications, endless scrolling and pressure to conform to the false and unrealistic perfectionism that can be served up by influencers,\u201d she added.",
      "Bose received heated questions from several senators and challenges to the accuracy of her answers.",
      "Opposition Sen. Ross Cadell asked how his 10-year-old stepson was able to hold Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube accounts from the age of 8, despite the platforms setting a nominal age limit of 13.",
      "Bose replied that \u201cthis is an area where the industry needs to improve.\u201d",
      "She said the proposed social media ban risked isolating some children and driving children to \u201cdarker, less safe online spaces\u201d than mainstream platforms.",
      "Bose said her concern with the proposed law was that \u201cthis could compromise the safety of young people,\u201d prompting a hostile response from opposition Sen. Sarah Henderson.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an outrageous statement. You\u2019re trying to protect the big tech giants,\u201d Henderson said.",
      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn\u2019t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.",
      "\u201cYour platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that\u2019s stopping them is themselves and their greed,\u201d Lambie said.",
      "Bose said algorithms were already in place to protect young people online through functions including filtering out nudity.",
      "\u201cWe need to see continued investment in algorithms and ensuring that they do a better job at addressing harmful content,\u201d Bose said.",
      "Questioned by opposition Sen. Dave Sharma, Bose said she didn\u2019t know how much advertising revenue the platforms she represented made from Australian children.",
      "She said she was not familiar with research by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health that found X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat made $11 billion in advertising from U.S. users under 18 in 2022.",
      "Communications department official Sarah Vandenbroek told the committee the evaluation of age assurance technologies that will report in June would assess not only their accuracy but also their security and privacy settings.",
      "Department Deputy Secretary James Chisholm said officials had consulted widely before proposing the age limit.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s a good idea and it can be done,\u201d Chisholm told the committee."

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Biden administration plans on reducing part of Intel's $8.5 billion in federal funding for computer chip plants around the country, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The reduction is largely a byproduct of the $3 billion that Intel is also receiving to provide computer chips to the military. President Joe Biden announced the agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans in March.",
      "The changes to Intel\u2019s funding are not related to the company\u2019s financial record or milestones, the people familiar with the grant told The Associated Press. In August, the chipmaker announced that it would cut 15% of its workforce \u2014 about 15,000 jobs \u2014 in an attempt to turn its business around to compete with more successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD.",
      "Unlike some of its rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them.",
      "Two years ago, President Biden hailed Intel as a job creator with its plans to open a new plant near Columbus, Ohio. The president praised the company for plans to \u201cbuild a workforce of the future\u201d for the $20 billion project, which he said would generate 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs set to pay an average of $135,000 a year.",
      "The California-based tech giant's funding is tied to a sweeping 2022 law that President Biden has celebrated and which is designed to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Known as the CHIPS and Science Act, the $280 billion package is aimed at sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and manufacturing while minimizing the kinds of supply disruptions that occurred in 2021, after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when a shortage of chips stalled factory assembly lines and fueled inflation.",
      "The Biden administration helped shepherd the legislation following pandemic-era concerns that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into recession. When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production.",
      "In August, the administration pledged to provide up to $6.6 billion so that a Taiwanese semiconductor giant could expand the facilities it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the most advanced microchips are produced domestically for the first time. The Commerce Department said the funding for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. meant the company could expand on its existing plans for two facilities in Phoenix and add a third, newly announced production hub.",
      "The administration has promised tens of billions of dollars to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",

      "\u201cI have the best health professionals helping me to make a recovery. I will be back as soon as I can. Please be patient and pray for my family and I,\u201d the post said.",
      "Dotcom\u2019s U.S.-based lawyer, Ira Rothken, confirmed to The Associated Press that the contents of the statement were accurate. Rothken would not say whether Dotcom or someone else wrote the post and did not provide further details.",
      "Usually a prolific X user, the 50-year-old internet mogul last posted to the site on Nov. 6. His New Zealand-based lawyer, Ron Mansfield, told the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday that Dotcom suffered the stroke on Nov. 7 and is expected to remain hospitalized for some time. His prognosis is uncertain, Mansfield said.",
      "News of his ill health comes during a protracted battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire to the United States from New Zealand to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.",
      "In August, New Zealand \u2019s justice minister announced that Dotcom should be surrendered to the United States to face trial, a ruling intended to cap a 12-year legal battle. A date for the extradition was not set, and Paul Goldsmith, the minister, said Dotcom would be allowed \u201ca short period of time to consider and take advice\u201d on the decision.",
      "Rothken at the time wrote on X that Dotcom intended to challenge the order in court through a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official\u2019s decision was reached correctly.",
      "The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers. Prosecutors said the once wildly popular Megaupload raked in at least $175 million \u2014 mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies \u2014 before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested had argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors argued the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "The men fought the order for years \u2014 lambasting the investigation and arrests \u2014 but in 2021 New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be extradited. It remained up to the country\u2019s Justice Minister to decide if the extradition should proceed.",
      "\u201cI love New Zealand. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d German-born Dotcom wrote on X in August. He did not respond to an AP request for comment at the time, or on Monday.",
      "Two of Dotcom\u2019s former business partners pleaded guilty to the charges they faced and served time in a New Zealand jail, avoiding extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors abandoned an extradition bid against another, who has since died of cancer."

      "Australia\u2019s House of Representatives has passed a bill that would ban children younger than 16 years from social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would ban children younger than 16 years old from social media, leaving it to the Senate to finalize the world-first law.",
      "The major parties backed the bill that would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "The legislation passed 102 to 13. If the bill becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "\u201cWill it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people\u2019s lives,\u201d Tehan told Parliament.",
      "The bill was introduced to the Senate late Wednesday but it adjourned for the day hours later without putting it to a vote. The legislation will likely be passed on Thursday, the Parliament's final session for the year and potentially the last before elections, which are due within months.",
      "The major parties\u2019 support all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.",
      "Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms encountered, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would \u201cmake zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,\u201d Daniel told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that\u2019s because no other country wants to do it,\u201d she added.",
      "The platforms had asked for the vote to be delayed until at least June next year when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies made its report on how the ban could be enforced.",
      "Melbourne resident Wayne Holdsworth, whose 17-year-old son Mac took his own life last year after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, described the bill as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnd in my opinion, it\u2019s the greatest time in our country\u2019s history,\u201d he added, referring to the pending legal reform."

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:46:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The dismissal of special counsel Jack Smith's federal election subversion case against Donald Trump leaves key questions about the extent of executive power unanswered.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court's blockbuster ruling on executive power is now left untested.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in July handed down what one justice called a \"rule for the ages\" on presidential immunity.",
      "But the dismissal of special counsel Jack Smith's federal election subversion case against Donald Trump leaves key questions about the extent of executive power unanswered.",
      "Smith's criminal prosecution was set to be the first major test of the court's blockbuster decision, in which the conservative majority held former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for \"core\" constitutional functions and presumptive immunity for \"official\" acts but no immunity for \"unofficial\" acts.",
      "What constituted an official or unofficial act raised \"difficult questions\" said Chief Justice John Roberts, and was largely left to lower courts to parse out answers through hearings and appeals about specific facts and actions.",
      "Could Trump be held liable for alleged pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to unilaterally reject the 2020 election outcome? What about his false statements to the public about voter fraud?",
      "That's impossible to say for now as Smith moved to have the case dropped in the wake of Trump's 2024 win, citing long-standing Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of a sitting president. He also dropped the classified documents case against Trump.",
      "\"This uncertainty over the scope of presidential immunity raises the specter for both Trump and any future president that they truly are above criminal law,\" said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University in Minnesota.",
      "Trump is already entering office with fewer potential checks than in his first term. Both the House and the Senate will be controlled by Republicans, making congressional oversight and impeachment two tools unlikely to be used should he be accused of crossing a traditional boundary.",
      "He will also not be subject to electoral accountability, given that this is the last term he can serve.",
      "The possibility of criminal prosecution would normally be another check, but experts aren't so sure after the Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina, said the immunity ruling \"will undoubtedly ensure that there will be very few, quite limited guardrails against any abuse of power.\"",
      "\"To the extent that one is concerned about that emboldening him to take action without regard to consequences of criminal prosecution, that's a real concern,\" said Jessica Roth, a professor at Cardozo School of Law and a former federal prosecutor.",
      "The Supreme Court's liberal justices raised similar fears in their dissents, but Chief Justice Roberts pushed back that the majority opinion \"does not place him above the law.\"",
      "\"Like everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity,\" he wrote. \"But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan tossed the federal election subversion case without prejudice, meaning, in theory, the charges could be filed again when Trump leaves office. Though experts noted such a scenario is highly improbable and could run up against statute of limitations or other problems.",
      "Some immunity questions could still play out in the state cases against Trump in New York and Georgia -- but those have also stalled in recent weeks.",
      "Trump was convicted by a jury on 34 felony charges in connection to a hush money payments made just before the 2016 election. Now, he's seeking to have the case dismissed based on the U.S. Supreme Court's immunity ruling. The judge has indefinitely postponed sentencing for Trump until the issue is sorted.",
      "\"That's the place where we'd see the Supreme Court decision tested most immediately,\" said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment trial.",
      "Still, Eisen said \"we will not get all the answers in the state case because it's a pretty tangential immunity claim.\"",
      "Eisen noted ongoing prosecutions against other figures involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election could keep at least some of Trump's past behavior in the spotlight.",
      "\"[Trump] may be immune, he may be in office, but all over the country cases have been brought against the false electors,\" Eisen said. \"And those cases will proceed to trial and illuminate Trump's involvement even though he's not a defendant in those cases. That's another place where certainly there's going to be a form of public narrative about what happened, his role in it and whether he should be held accountable.\"",

President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and unshackling American energy,\" Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.",

      "\u201cWe believe in democracy in this organization, and obviously some people didn't want us to live democracy out the way we were living it,\u201d Mike Rawlings, the group's national convention chairman, told the call before tossing to Dan Webb, a No Labels board member, who updated supporters on the legal findings.",
      "Webb notified supporters that they called on the Department of Justice to look into any potential illegal conduct.",
      "\u201cI think one of the defining stories will be that it's just wrong for a group of elite donors, party operatives, media mouthpieces to actually decide that the way, the way we should protect democracy is to make sure we have less of it,\u201d Webb said.",
      "Most of the No Labels \"family members\" on the call were infuriated with the allegations and pleaded for national exposure, suggesting outlets like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d or Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast to spread awareness. Overall, the call was an opportunity for supporters to air their grievances.",
      "\u201cI agree wholeheartedly with publicizing this as much as possible, and not making it seem like it's just normal politics,\u201d one supporter said.",
      "\u201cThis is not acceptable; they've interfered with the democratic process here,\u201d another supporter added.",
      "Asked if the efforts were \u201cjust politics\u201d or \u201cdirty politics,\u201d No Labels leaders suggested it went beyond that.",
      "\u201cI'm a strong believer in the First Amendment, and political speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment, but the law is also clear that you cannot violate the law and claim that even though you violated the law, you were just engaging in politics,\u201d Webb said.",
      "He continued, \u201cI believe we did the right thing by reporting the information to the Department of Justice, and whatever the Department of Justice decides to do, they decide to do.\u201d",
      "One supporter suggested that the scandal sounded like Watergate and questioned whether it was worth pursuing lawsuits. Another supporter told No Labels leaders to focus on the Problem Solvers Caucus in Congress and dismiss the past.",
      "\u201cWe should focus on the fact that no candidate received a majority in this election,\u201d one supporter suggested. \u201cOur need is to focus on fixing Congress. So I think we need to balance this very carefully and not focus on a way that distracts from one main issue, and casts us as being associated with the Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Back in April, the group halted its efforts when it was unable to find a candidate that had a credible path to winning with its bipartisan platform.",
      "No Labels intended to offer a different choice than the presumptive presidential nominees at that time -- incumbent President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump -- to citizens who yearned for something new instead of a repeat of the 2020 election. As they entered the race in March, they suggested their internal polling showed more than 70% of Americans said they'd be open to another option.",
      "The group intends to meet with supporters in Washington, D.C., in December to create a plan to deal with the new Congress and work with congressional leaders.",

    "summary": "Named to lead the nation\u2019s sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has big ideas for busting public health policy norms.",
    "story": [
      "\"Make America Healthy Again\" would collide with Washington bureaucracy.",
      "Named to lead the nation's sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has big ideas for busting public health policy norms.",
      "His Senate confirmation hearings -- should they happen -- will come with lots of questions about what Kennedy's ideas would look like in practice.",
      "His new role would mean relinquishing his outsider critic status and working from within a massive government system, leading an agency of 80,000 employees and dealing with everything from drug approvals to food recalls to the pandemic response.",
      "So, what happens when his motto \"Make America Healthy Again\" collides with one of Washington's largest government bureaucracies?",
      "\"He seems very clear on what it is he wants to get done. I'm just not sure he has an understanding of what it will take to get that done,\" said one former senior HHS official who worked in the Biden administration.",
      "On vaccines, President-elect Donald Trump's picks of Johns Hopkins University professor Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, former GOP Rep. Dave Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as surgeon general certainly add to Kennedy's ability to make changes -- if they're confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Both Makary and Weldon have raised questions about vaccine side effects, although they've also at times been supportive overall of the role vaccines play in public health. Kennedy himself has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, which has been debunked by numerous studies.",
      "In their new positions, Makary, Weldon and Kennedy would have the power to select the experts who sit on important FDA and CDC advisory panels. Those panels play a key role in vaccine recommendations and authorizations for the general public, ultimately creating public health guidance for years to come.",
      "\"I think massively, in large part, the health care community would continue to move forward on vaccines as they do now, as they are considered to be one of the massive successes of public health in the last 100 years. And I don't think that would change,\" said Tom Inglesby, a former senior adviser to HHS and the White House during COVID-19 during the Biden administration.",
      "\"But what could change is potentially the cost of vaccines, the access to vaccines, guidance around new vaccines that might come online, and also confusion around public messaging from the federal government about safety and effectiveness of vaccines,\" Inglesby said.",
      "When it comes to chemicals and the food Americans consume, it's less clear how Kennedy could make changes at HHS, as opposed to the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Agriculture, which have more oversight of areas such as water fluoridation, which Kennedy opposes, or school lunches, which he says he wants to make healthier. He has said, however, that he would gut the entire nutrition department at the FDA.",
      "Kennedy could also move around funding -- he's said he'd deprioritize infectious disease research in favor of chronic illness research, for example. As avian flu cases continue to rise -- raising concerns about a new pandemic -- public health experts and former government officials have pushed back strongly on that idea.",
      "But he has also called for restrictions on food additives, dyes and ultra-processed foods, something he could have direct influence over through the FDA, which determines safe thresholds for the \"Acceptable Daily Intake\" on substances.",
      "Kennedy has generally received a more cautious welcome from the public health community regarding his focus on healthy food.",
      "\"There are some things here that are worth working on. You know, if we're looking at the school lunch program in America, 30 million children get more than half of their calories from that program. It would be a wonderful thing to make that the best school lunch program possible,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, former CDC acting director.",
      "But many public health experts are also wary of giving Kennedy credit, for fear it could lend credibility to other false information he promotes. He advocates drinking raw milk, for example, even though the pasteurization process kills off bacteria that can cause serious illness, including the fast-spreading avian flu.",
      "\"One of the dangerous things about RFK Jr. is that there are bits of things he says that are true, and they're mixed in. And it makes it really hard to sort out what things you should follow because they're based on fact, and which things are not,\" Besser told ABC News, where he was former chief health and medical editor.",
      "Experts also question Kennedy's ability to counter powerful Washington lobbies -- one of his stated main goals -- in a Trump administration focused on working with big business on deregulating industries.",
      "Another area where Kennedy could be out of line with the Trump administration is abortion access. Kennedy has said he supports legal abortion access until fetal viability (despite an earlier comment on the campaign trail that he later walked back about supporting a 15-week ban) and that such decisions should be up to women.",
      "Many abortion rights advocates still expect the Trump administration to quickly move to rescind protections and halt legal fights the Biden administration initiated after the fall of Roe v. Wade -- but are hopeful that Kennedy and the broader administration would not attempt sweeping bans.",
      "\"[Trump's] obviously waffled on this and other issues a thousand times so I'm not going to trust every word he says, but I do think there's the possibility that he and his administration has seen that actually, abortion access is very popular,\" said Katie O'Connor, senior director of abortion policy at the National Women's Law Center.",
      "\"We have seen that over the past three elections, and there could be pushback if this administration does something to further restrict abortion access.\"",
      "There are certainly members of Trump's orbit who would support broader restrictions on abortion, but Trump himself has said he would not sign a federal ban if Congress passed one.",
      "Some of the policies O'Connor expects to see rolled back would include the Pentagon paying for service members who need to cross state lines to get an abortion because of where they were stationed, as well as expanded access to abortion pills through telemedicine.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy could undo these rules and also build on the first Trump administration's efforts. He could expand protections for health care providers who don't want to perform abortion procedures, allowing more providers to deny care, and make it more difficult for private insurers to cover abortion, leaving it more expensive for patients, O'Connor said.",
      "Large-scale bans, were they executed, would focus on removing access to the medication abortion pill called mifepristone, either by attempting to take medication abortion off the market by way of the FDA approval process, or employing a very old law called the Comstock Act to prohibit the pills from being mailed.",
      "\"I do hold out hope that this administration doesn't want to expand political capital on abortion,\" O'Connor said.",

      "Overnight Wednesday, one of two outstanding races in California tipped toward Democrats, giving Adam Gray a roughly 182-vote lead over GOP Rep. John Duarte in the inland 13th Congressional District in the San Joaquin Valley. In California's 45th Congressional District, anchored in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, Democrat Derek Tran has a roughly 600-vote lead over Republican Rep. Michelle Steel.",
      "In Iowa, GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks is up by 800 votes in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, though a recount is unlikely to change the result in the competitive district. Miller-Meeks first won her seat in 2020 by six votes.",
      "If these results hold, the House will start with a 220-215 GOP majority, even thinner than the current Congress' margin.",
      "Republican ranks, however, drop to 219 with former Rep. Matt Gaetz's resignation. It could fall further to 217 depending on the timing of the resignations of Reps. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Mike Waltz, R-Fla., who are set to join the Trump administration as U.S. ambassador to United Nations and national security adviser, respectively.",
      "That would send the chamber to a 217-215 margin -- giving Republicans no room for error, since any tied votes at 216-216 would fail.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pleaded with Trump to avoid taking any more House members for his administration.",
      "\"It's a great problem to have,\" Johnson said on Fox News earlier this month. \"We have an embarrassment of riches in the House Republican Congress. Lots of talented people who are very attuned to the America First agenda, and they can serve the country well in other capacities.\"",
      "\"But I've told President Trump, enough already, give me some relief. I have to maintain this majority. And he understands that, of course, we've been talking about it almost hourly every day,\" he added.",
      "Already, Republicans have dealt with chaos in the current Congress.",
      "Bands of hardline members have grown just large enough to block votes on bills, moves that were once viewed as beyond the pale within the halls of Congress. And, unforgettably, Republican divisions left the House without a speaker for days, both at the beginning when Kevin McCarthy was looking to get the requisite support and again after he gave up the gavel and members were torn for days before coalescing behind Johnson.",
      "Heading into the current Congress, Republicans have sought to grease the skids a little bit more to try to avoid such public brawls from happening in the future.",
      "Republicans agreed to raise the number of lawmakers needed to trigger a vote to oust a speaker from one to nine. In return, lawmakers who oppose proposals to allow votes on bills will not face retaliation.",
      "But with such a narrow margin, any one Republican could and throw the floor into chaos and block the party-line passage of key bills.",
      "One of the largest legislative items up for business is an extension of the 2017 tax cuts that Trump pushed during his first term. They're set to expire next year, and Republicans have hoped to extend them -- but 12 House Republicans voted against the 2017 GOP tax law, which only passed thanks to a larger majority at the time.",
      "In 2017, when Republicans passed a rewrite of the tax code during the first Trump administration, 12 House Republicans -- part of a larger majority at the time -- voted against the bill, but did not prevent its passage.",
      "Republicans began the 118th Congress in 2023 with 222 seats -- a 10-seat margin over 212 Democrats -- a majority that spent weeks in the winter selecting a House speaker, and a chunk of the fall selecting a replacement.",
      "A few illnesses, special election surprises, or absences could also disrupt Republicans' careful balancing act.",
      "In 1917, Republicans held the narrowest majority in history with a 215-213 edge over Democrats. But a group of minor party lawmakers worked with the minority to elect a speaker, delivering the chamber to Democrats, according to Pew.",

      "The 48 areas included 46 states, the District of Columbia and New York City, excluding California, Maryland, New Hampshire and New Jersey.",
      "The abortion rate was 11.2 abortions per 1,000 women between ages 15 and 44 in 2022, a decrease of 3% from 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women the prior year, according to data from 46 states and New York City.",
      "Rates were lowest in Missouri and highest New Mexico, respectively, in 2022. After Roe v. Wade was overruled, Missouri passed a near-total abortion ban with limited exceptions while abortions remained unrestricted based on gestational duration in New Mexico. However, in 2024, Missouri voters approved an amendment enshrining the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution, including abortion care.",
      "Dr. Adam Jacobs, medical director of the division of complex family planning at the Mount Sinai Heath System in New York, said he does not believe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health -- the Supreme Court decision that led to Roe v. Wade's overruling -- is a major reason why abortion rates dropped between 2021 and 2022.",
      "\"Many of the bans did not go into place or a lot of the structural changes did not go into place in the calendar year of 2022, so I don't think you would see that impact in this report,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Jacobs said abortion numbers and rates have been decreasing for years, and key reasons include the Affordable Care Act. The law gives women more access to preventive services, including long-lasting reversible contraception.",
      "The report found that women in their 20s accounted for more than half of abortions in 2022 and had the highest abortion rates. Comparatively, adolescents under age 15 and women aged 40 or older accounted for the lowest percentages of abortions and had the lowest abortion rates.",
      "Between 2013 and 2022, abortion rates decreased among all age groups except for women between ages 30 and 34, for whom rates increased.",
      "When it came to breaking down the share of abortions based on gestational age, the report found that most abortions, or 78.6%, were performed at 9 weeks gestation and nearly all abortions were performed under 13 weeks gestation.",
      "More than half of abortions were early medication ones performed at or under 9 weeks gestation followed by surgical abortions at or under 13 weeks gestation.",
      "Surgical abortions performed past 13 weeks gestation accounted for just 6.9% of all abortions in 2022 and medication abortion past 9 weeks gestation accounted for 4.3%.",
      "Black women accounted for the highest percentage of abortions at 39.5% followed by white women at 31.9% and Hispanic women at 21.2%, according to the report.",
      "Black women had the highest rate at 24.4 abortions per 1,000 women between ages 15 and 44 and white women had the lowest rate at 5.7 abortions per 1,000 women.",
      "Jacobs said that gains have been made in providing care to marginalized groups, but factors including unequal access to quality family planning services may be why abortion rates are higher for Black women compared to white women.",
      "\"If you have access to highly effective contraception, you end up having [fewer] unintended pregnancies,\" he said.",
      "For 2022, 87.7% of abortions were among unmarried women compared to 12.3% among married women, the report found.",
      "Additionally, a plurality of abortions, or 40.6%, were among women who had never had a previous live birth, and a majority, or 56.1%, were among those who had never received an abortion before.",

      "Dankers said gravy is a prime example of a \u201cmake it at your destination\u201d item. Stuffing is considered a solid and is OK to carry on. Pies are, too, but they require some extra scrutiny, Dankers said.",

There were no injuries, but the planes were deboarded and needed to be checked for damage, she said.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement that the contact was made as its plane, which had arrived from London, was pulling into the gate. The other plane was stationary. It said there were no injuries.",
      "\u201cThe aircraft has been removed from service for inspection by our maintenance team,\u201d its statement said.",
      "On Monday night, a tug vehicle towing an empty JetBlue plane struck a Cape Air plane. The two Cape Air pilots were taken to a hospital as a precaution, Decker said. The tug has been removed from service, and the JetBlue aircraft will undergo a thorough inspection, JetBlue said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe cannot live on the wages that we are being paid,\u201d ABM cabin cleaner Priscilla Hoyle said at a rally Monday. \u201cI can honestly say it\u2019s hard every single day with my children, working a full-time job but having to look my kids in the eyes and sit there and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to have a home today.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Advocates for transgender rights are turning to a conservative-dominated Supreme Court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "The justices on Wednesday are taking up the issue of gender-affirming care for transgender minors, which has been banned by Tennessee and 25 other Republican-led states.",
      "The fight over whether transgender adolescents can access puberty blockers and hormonal treatments is part of a broader effort to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.",
      "Trump backed a national ban on such care as part of his 2024 campaign in which he demeaned and mocked transgender people.",
      "In its waning days, the Biden administration, along with families of transgender adolescents, will appeal to the justices to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high, of course, for transgender adolescents, but also for the parents who are watching their children suffer, who are just trying to do right by their kids,\u201d Chase Strangio, who represents the families at the Supreme Court, said in an interview. Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, will be the first openly transgender person to argue before the high court.",
      "A lawyer for Tennessee will argue that the \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures\u201d are risky and unproven and that it\u2019s the state\u2019s role to protect children.",
      "Trump nominated three justices in his first term who pushed the court in a more conservative direction that included the decision in 2022 overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which had protected abortion rights for nearly 50 years.",
      "Yet one of Trump's appointees, Justice Neil Gorsuch, also authored a ruling in 2020 that protected LGBTQ people from discrimination in the workplace under federal civil rights law.",
      "The administration and transgender families both rely on that decision to bolster their arguments.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, it's possible the new administration could weigh in on the case, which is not expected to be decided until the spring.",
      "There are about 300,000 people between age 13 and 17, and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The Williams Institute is a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics to inform laws and public policy decisions.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee, and those laws mostly are in effect, despite legal challenges. The Tennessee case is the first time the nation\u2019s top court will consider the constitutionality of the bans.",
      "Sivan Kotler-Berkowitz, a 20-year-old college student in Massachusetts who is transgender, said his life would have been very different if he were just a few years younger and living in one of the states.",
      "\u201cThese bans are denying people the opportunity to live and excel,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere are thousands of transgender youth across the country that are thriving just like me because we\u2019ve had the love and understanding of our families and because we\u2019ve had access to proper care.\u201d",
      "The bans in Tennessee and elsewhere have put families in the position of deciding whether to travel for ongoing health care, go without or wait until their children turn 18.",
      "Erin Friday, a leader of Our Duty, an international group that supports the bans on gender-affirming care for minors, said the case is going to be as important as Roe v. Wade. She said upholding the Tennessee law would bolster the cases for the laws restricting sports participation and bathroom use.",
      "Among the arguments advanced by defenders of the state laws is that many children who initially say they are transgender eventually change their mind. Friday said her daughter was 11 when she said she was transgender, which Friday attributed to the child having been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d at school. But after receiving psychiatric treatment, her daughter changed her mind, Friday said. If laws like Tennessee\u2019s are struck down, \u201cmore children would be irreversibly harmed and live a life of deep regret,\u201d Friday said in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Guidelines from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health that were revised in 2022 say evidence of regret about transitioning is scant but also that patients should be told about the possibility during psychological counseling.",
      "Some doctors who work with transgender minors said a state should not come between doctors, their patients and parents. \u201cFrom a medical standpoint, I think it\u2019s really frightening and dangerous to think that legislators could pass a law that basically judges or controls what people could do with a medication based on a diagnosis,\u201d Dr. Susan Lacy of Memphis, Tennessee, who joined with the families in suing the state, said in an interview.",
      "Michelle Quist Ryder, CEO of the American Psychological Foundation, said the laws, if left in place, are damaging for the physical and mental health of transgender people and their supporters. Gender dysphoria \u2014 the unease a person may have when their assigned sex and gender identity don\u2019t match \u2014 has been linked to depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "\u201cThe more we lessen the sense of safety in this community, trans youth will look out and say, \u2018Who else is going to come after me?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "There are prominent names in some of the 83 briefs, an unusually high number, filed on both sides of the case. Actors Elliot Page and Nicole Maines, and Sarah McBride of Delaware, who in November became the first openly transgender person to win election to Congress, have joined more than five dozen people in urging the court to strike down the Tennessee law.",
      "Tennis legend Martina Navratilova and Olympic swimming gold medalists Donna de Varona and Summer Sanders are among 135 athletes, coaches, officials and parents who want the justices to uphold the ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",

      "Wisconsin's election commission leader has quietly certified Donald Trump's victory in the battleground state, a departure from the chaos that surrounded the 2020 election results",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin\u2019s election commission leader quietly certified Donald Trump \u2019s victory on Friday, moving past the chaos that surrounded the 2020 election results in the battleground state.",
      "Commission Chair Ann Jacobs certified results that show Trump won the state with 1,697,626 votes compared to Democrat Kamala Harris' 1,668,229 votes during a morning Zoom teleconference that lasted six minutes.",
      "The certification felt almost anticlimactic compared with the aftermath of the 2020 election, when Trump refused to accept that Joe Biden had won the state by about 21,000 votes.",
      "Trump forced a recount in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the state's two Democratic strongholds, but it didn't change the outcome. Trump later sued to disqualify more than 221,000 ballots in the two counties. He wanted to disqualify absentee ballots cast early and in-person, saying there wasn\u2019t a proper written request made for the ballots; absentee ballots cast by people who claimed \u201cindefinitely confined\u201d status; absentee ballots collected by poll workers at Madison parks; and absentee ballots where clerks filled in missing information on ballot envelopes.",
      "The state Supreme Court dismissed the case in December 2020, finding four of Trump's claims were filed too late and the other was without merit. A federal judge that same month dismissed another lawsuit filed by two Republican legislators, voting rights groups and others seeking to overturn the results.",
      "Facing pressure from Trump, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos hired former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman in the spring of 2021 to investigate allegations of fraud and abuse related to the election.",
      "The probe ultimately turned up nothing. The state Office of Lawyer Regulation filed a complaint against Gableman last week accusing him of violating multiple rules of conduct during the investigation. The state Supreme Court will decide what sanctions, if any, Gableman will face.",
      "The election commission's nonpartisan administrator, Meagan Wolfe, found herself the target of conspiracy theorists and election skeptics who falsely claimed she was part of a plot to rig the 2020 election for Biden. Republican legislators are trying to fire her but the commission has filed a lawsuit to keep in her post. That case is currently before the state Supreme Court.",
      "Trump's national victory in November has calmed conservative anger but a vocal faction of the GOP remains deeply skeptical of election processes, particularly the use of mail ballots and scanners to tally votes. Still, several states that saw tumultuous certifications during the 2020 election and 2022 midterms have smoothly approved their results in recent weeks, including Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico."

      "LOS ANGELES -- The owner of an oil field in Los Angeles County is suing the state of California over a law that will require it to stop production and plug its wells or face costly fines.",
      "Inglewood Oil Field owner Sentinel Peak argues in the lawsuit, filed this week, that the law, which was signed in September by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is unconstitutional, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.",
      "It is was one of several laws aiming to reduce pollution by giving local governments more authority to restrict oil and gas operations by shutting down so-called idle wells, which are not in use but have not been properly sealed and closed, and fining companies for operating low-producing oil wells in the Inglewood field.",
      "The 1,000-acre area southwest of downtown Los Angeles has approximately 820 unplugged wells, including 420 that are actively pumping. Roughly 80% of the operating wells are considered low-producing, meaning they yield less than 15 barrels of oil or 60,000 cubic feet of gas per day, the newspaper reported.",
      "Attorneys for Sentinel Peak argue that the law \u201crepresents an illegal attempt to coerce an individual company to stop operation of its legal business,\u201d according to court documents. They allege that mandatory fines, in particular, violate federal and state laws forbidding excessive fines.",
      "The suit calls the penalties \u201cgrossly\u201d disproportionate, with \u201cno apparent upper limit\u201d or \u201crelationship to any actual harm.\u201d",
      "The California Department of Conservation\u2019s Geological Energy Management Division, the state oil and gas regulator, declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "But Assemblyman Isaac Bryan, a Democrat who represents the area where the oil field is located and who authored the law, vowed to defend it.",
      "\u201cOur community has stood strong for decades to close this dangerous low-producing oil field, and we will stand strong in court to protect those frontline communities who have long deserved the right to live a full and healthy life,\u201d Bryan told the Times. \u201cThe people of California spoke through their legislature that dangerous oil wells have no business right next to the community.\u201d"

      "MILWAUKEE -- The Aurora Health Care Mobile Medical Clinic team waited patiently at a table in the main hallway of the Milwaukee Public Library\u2019s sprawling downtown branch, a blood pressure cuff and mental health questionnaire at the ready as they called out to patrons who paused: \u201cDo you have any questions about your health?\u201d",
      "On this Tuesday afternoon, one man did. His joints were bothering him, he told Carolyn McCarthy, the team\u2019s nurse practitioner. And he knew his bones need calcium to stay strong, so he stopped taking his blood pressure medication, a calcium channel blocker.",
      "McCarthy talked with him at length in simple and specific terms about how the medication worked on his cells, why it was important to take and how it doesn\u2019t affect calcium storage in his bones.",
      "\u201cHopefully, he walked away a little bit more informed,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "The mobile clinic is one of several health programs offered by libraries around across the U.S. \u2014 from tiny rural town libraries to large urban systems. They offer fitness classes, food pantries, cooking classes, conversations about loneliness and mental health, and even blood pressure monitors that can be checked out just like books.",
      "The public health programs leverage libraries' reputation as sources of reliable information and their ability to reach people beyond formal health care settings. No money, insurance, language skills or ID required, no limits on age. All are welcome.",
      "Libraries are \u201cthe last true public institution,\u201d said Jaime Placht, a health and well-being specialist at the Kansas City Public Library system in Kansas City, Missouri. The system has a full-time social work team. \u201cThe library is a public health space.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Public Library, along with Milwaukee and several others, is part of the American Heart Association's Libraries with Heart program. Several Kansas City branches have blood pressure stations \u2014 which Placht said have been used 13,000 times \u2014 as well as a take-home blood pressure kits that have been checked out nearly 100 times. The program started there about a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe have patrons that say, \u2018Because I used the blood pressure monitor at the library, I went and saw my physician for the first time in a long time,\u2019\u201d Placht said.",
      "There is no local public health office in Jarrell, Texas, a small town between Austin and Waco. But there is a nonprofit library that can connect patrons to mental health help. It's one of nine rural libraries in central Texas that receives funding from the St. David\u2019s Foundation, the philanthropic arm of one of the state\u2019s largest health systems.",
      "Jarrell Community Library and Resource Center is a place for brave conversations. When a senior card game group turned to a discussion of the best crematorium in town, the library brought in local experts to teach about end-of-life planning, library director Susan Gregurek said. Last year, seven women came to the library for information on how to file restraining orders against their husbands.",
      "\u201cThis is mental health, but it\u2019s obviously larger than mental health,\" Gregurek said.",
      "The public library in Smithville, Texas, which also gets money from the Libraries for Health program, stocks boxes of surplus food from area farmers and built out programs that help teens, older adults and parents address isolation. The library\u2019s peer support specialist has gone from working with four to five people a month to nearly 60 in the community southeast of Austin.",
      "St. David's Foundation has invested more than $3 million in the program over three years, which Smithville library director Judy Bergeron said is key when she hears comments like, \u201cWhy are we funding the library so much? Nobody reads anymore.\u201d",
      "A year and a half into being in Milwaukee's libraries, mobile health clinic reaches eight patrons on average per visit. They've had some people come back to say they went to the hospital and got a life-saving treatment, McCarthy said. They\u2019ve also had patients who did not seek help and later died.",
      "\u201cWhat we do is a Band-Aid on a broken (health care) system,\u201d McCarthy said of the clinic.",
      "Another library effort in Milwaukee teaches kids about healthy nutrition habits at the Mitchell Street branch \u2014 a weekly after-school program run by chef Sharrie Agee since 2022.",
      "\u201cCertain areas of Milwaukee don\u2019t have the same opportunities to (access) healthy ingredients, healthy sources of food, the knowledge behind how to use those ingredients,\u201d said Agee, whose class learns how to make snacks from different continents.",
      "Four junior chefs helped her cut cheese and tomatoes for a pizza this month while she quizzed the rest of the attendees: What country is pizza from? What ingredients are listed on the recipe?",
      "Ruby Herrera, 40, brought her children to help them learn to cook something healthy and try different foods. Her older kids cook everything in the air fryer.",
      "Yareni Orduna-Herrera, 7, ran over to her mom, smiling, her task of slicing tomatoes complete.",
      "She said she'll try the recipe home again and also wants to learn to make rice and beans. But first, she needed to taste the pizza.",
      "\u201cThe one that I made,\u201d she said with pride.",

      "Black Friday is giving way to a white weekend in parts of New York state",
      "BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Black Friday was giving way to a white weekend in parts of New York state, with the first big snow of the season threatening to bury towns along lakes Erie and Ontario during a hectic holiday travel and shopping weekend.",
      "As flakes began flying Friday, forecasters warned 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) of blowing and drifting snow could fall in Watertown and other areas east of Lake Ontario through Monday.",
      "After an unusually mild fall, as much as 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) of snow were possible along Lake Erie and south of Buffalo from lake-effect bands notorious for pummeling the region with snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) per hour. Lake-effect snow happens when warm moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead.",
      "\u201cThe lake is 50 degrees (10 degrees Celsius). We\u2019re about six degrees above where we should be this time of year, that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing these heavy lake-effect events,\u201d Erie County Public Works Commissioner William Geary said. \u201cThe outlook for the next two weeks into December, we\u2019ll probably see some more.\u201d",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a disaster emergency for the targeted counties, allowing state agencies to mobilize resources. Rapidly deteriorating conditions Friday caused closures along Interstate 90, and tandem and commercial vehicles were banned from Interstate 86 in western New York and much of state Route 219 beginning Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a considerable number of vehicles going off the road on the 219 currently,\u201d Gregory Butcher, Erie County's deputy director for preparedness and homeland security, said at an afternoon briefing. He said ATVs and snowmobiles were being placed around the county to help first responders if necessary.",
      "The Buffalo Bills called for volunteers potentially willing to shovel snow at Highmark Stadium, where over 2 feet (0.6 meters) of snow was possible before Sunday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers. Earlier this year, a major lake-effect storm forced the NFL to push back the Bills wild-card playoff home game against Pittsburgh from Jan. 14 to Jan. 15.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be slow going, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said, adding the heaviest snow is expected to be over by kickoff.",
      "The team, meanwhile, was preparing to play in any conditions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to stay on top of it,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said on Friday.",
      "\u201cYou guys know things change around here quickly with the weather coming off the lake and everything. So we do the best we can,\u201d he added.",
      "The Bills are 9-2, their best start since 1992, and with a win Sunday, they would clinch their fifth straight AFC East title.",
      "Lake-effect snow also covered parts of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula in a system that is expected to last through the weekend.",
      "The area was blanketed in snow by Friday afternoon, with some places already measuring more than a foot (0.3 meters) of snow.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got this westerly, northwesterly flow regime and this chilly air mass over the U.P.,\u201d National Weather Service meteorologist Lily Chapman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a pretty good setup for this long duration lake-effect snowfall event.\u201d",
      "Heavy lake-effect snow in parts of northern Michigan was expected to continue into the weekend, according to the weather service's Gaylord office. Some areas of the Upper Peninsula could see up to 3 feet (0.9 meters) of snow Sunday night through to Monday, Chapman said.",
      "Gusty winds, especially near the Great Lakes, have impacted visibility, and Chapman urged caution on the roads.",
      "Another weather service meteorologist, Joe DeLizio, said he hadn\u2019t been made aware of any major accidents so far.",
      "\u201cHaven\u2019t heard too much as far as problems, but obviously travel is pretty difficult,\u201d DeLizio said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Retailers used giveaways and big discounts to reward U.S. shoppers who ventured out for Black Friday even as earlier offers, the prospect of better bargains in the days ahead and the ease of e-commerce drained much of the excitement from the holiday shopping season's much-hyped kickoff.",
      "Frequent deals throughout the month and more awaiting on Cyber Monday gave consumers less of a reason to squabble over store shelves while trying to get their hands on TVs or toys. But shopping malls and merchants big and small used the day after Thanksgiving to entice customers into physical stores at a time when many prefer to browse and buy online.",
      "Some Target shoppers lined up as early as 11:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day to get their hands on an exclusive book devoted to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour and a bonus edition of her \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\u201d album. Although both will be available purchase online starting Saturday, many locations sold out their supply of the products, the discount retailer said.",
      "At a Target in Southfield, Michigan, a few miles north of Detroit, Marge Evans, 32, used her cellphone to take and send photos of shirts, sweaters and other apparel with Black Friday markdowns. Her shopping cart was full, but she was shopping for an upcoming cruise with her fiance, not Christmas.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll see what things are looking like the first week in January,\u201d the 32-year-old massage therapist said. \u201cReally, after the holidays are over is when the real deals come through. They get rid of everything.\u201d",
      "Industry analysts observed Black Friday shoppers displaying the same choosy, deal-driven behavior many U.S. consumers exhibited all year while adjusting prices after the period of inflation that started toward the end of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "At many stores, the huge crowds of Black Fridays past never returned after the pandemic. A Walmart in Germantown, Maryland, had only half of the parking spots filled on Friday morning. Some shoppers were returning items or buying groceries.",
      "Bharatharaj Moruejsan, a 35-year-old software engineer, decided to check out Walmart's offers because he was jet-lagged after returning from a month-long family vacation to India. He scored an iPad for his 1-year-old daughter for $250, 32% off its original $370 price tag.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a good deal,\u201d Moruejsan said.",
      "After visiting stores and shopping centers on Long Island, Marshal Cohen, chief retail adviser at market research firm Circana, said that apart from people lining up for Target's Taylor Swift merchandise, the number of shoppers appeared typical.",
      "\u201cThe spreading out of the holidays has created the lack of need and lack of urgency,\u201d said Cohen, who had a 20-person team monitoring crowds nationwide. \u201cThis is going to be a long, slow tedious process\u201d of getting shoppers to buy, he said.",
      "Michael Brown, a partner at management consulting firm Kearney, saw no lines at the Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, 10 minutes before the 7 a.m. opening.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the old Black Friday that we used to know,\u201d he said.",
      "Retailers that offered at least 40% off drove shoppers\u2019 attention, according to Brown. For example, Forever 21 had 50% to 70% discounts and had lines to the stores, while H&M, which offered 30% discounts, was relatively quiet.",
      "Enough consumers still enjoy holiday shopping in person that Black Friday nonetheless was expected to retain its crown remains the biggest day of the year for retail foot traffic in the U.S., according to retail technology company Sensormatic Solutions.",

      "Vivek Pandya, the lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said consumers\u202fspent a record $6.1 billion online Thursday, 8.8% more than on Thanksgiving last year. Bigger-than-expected discounts helped spur spending on electronics, apparel and other categories, Pandya said.",
      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then retreat to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research.",
      "Analysts forecast a solid holiday shopping season overall in the U.S., though perhaps not as robust as last year. Retailers were even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.",
      "Shoppers at Lakeside Shopping Center in Metairie, Louisiana, were treated to a glass of champagne and a $50 gift receipt.",

      "The mall was on target to exceed the 200,000 Black Friday customer visits it received in 2023, Renslow said. Stores with deep discounts and promotions were the most packed, she said, citing Lego\u2019s giveaway of a free retro record player with a $250 purchase.",
      "Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties, which operates 85 shopping properties, and Bill Taubman, president and chief operating officer of upscale mall landlord Taubman Realty Group, also said customer visits were up.",

      "Even though it is easier for people in these isolated, rural communities to buy Christmas presents these days, Dougherty made the short trek to Fort Blackmore with her niece on Saturday, carrying on the family tradition that she is glad she can still share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice that they do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows the true Christmas spirit.\u201d",
      "CSX employees consider it an honor to be chosen to staff the Santa Train as volunteers. Jesse Hensley had been trying to get a spot for 35 years, ever since he met his wife, Angie, who grew up with the Santa Train in St. Paul, Virginia.",
      "\u201cIt was such a thrill when we heard that whistle blow,\u201d she remembered. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, you know, you have dreams. My dream was to ride that train. Never in my life did I ever think that I would get to.\u201d",
      "The pair was selected to ride the train this year because they volunteered countless hours after the flooding caused by Hurricane Helene devastated their community of Erwin, Tennessee, where Jesse Hensley works as a machinist mechanic for CSX.",
      "The Santa Train doesn't run to Erwin, but CSX added a special event this year to bring cheer to the community. Residents were invited to a holiday party with food, music, and gifts in the Erwin rail yard. Santa paid a visit on train with cars decked out in lights forming the shapes of ornaments, moving jingle bells, marching toy soldiers, and the words \u201cHoliday Express\u201d in giant red letters.",
      "Two days later, Angie Hensley was all smiles on the Santa Train and nearly as excited as the children she helped distribute toys to, including grandnieces and grandnephews in St. Paul. The joy of helping on the Santa Train was even better than she had imagined, she said.",
      "Her fellow volunteers included CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs, who got off at every stop, handing out toys and talking to those who had come to see the train. Hinrichs' best memory so far was at a stop a couple of years ago when a family brought a disabled child but were hanging back from the train to avoid the tussle of the crowd. Helpers cleared a path to bring the boy forward and gave him a giant teddy bear they had saved for a special occasion.",
      "\u201cWe brought it out there, and everybody got around it, and we gave it to him. And there wasn\u2019t a dry eye anywhere,\u201d Hinrichs said. \"It was a magical moment.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 17:38:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump is creating a National Energy Council that he says will establish U.S. &ldquo;energy dominance&rdquo; around the world",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is creating a National Energy Council that he says will establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is set to create a National Energy Council that he says will establish American \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on climate change.",
      "The energy council \u2014 to be led by North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s choice to head the Interior Department \u2014 will be key in Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\" and sell more oil and other energy sources to allies in Europe and around the globe.",
      "The new council will be granted sweeping authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a mandate to cut bureaucratic red tape, enhance private sector investments and focus on innovation instead of \u201ctotally unnecessary regulation,\u201d Trump said.",
      "But Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits. For one, U.S. oil production under Biden is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",
      "A call for energy dominance \u2014 a term Trump also used in his first term as president \u2014 \"is an opportunity, not a requirement,'' for the oil industry to move forward on drilling projects under terms that are likely to be more favorable to industry than those offered by Biden, said energy analyst Kevin Book.",
      "Whether Trump achieves energy dominance \u2014 however he defines it \u2014 \"comes down to decisions by private companies, based on how they see supply-demand balances in the global marketplace,'' said Book, managing partner at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm. Don't expect an immediate influx of new oil rigs dotting the national landscape, he said.",
      "Trump's bid to boost oil supplies \u2014 and lower U.S. prices \u2014 is complicated by his threat this week to impose 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest sources of U.S. oil imports. The U.S. oil industry warned the tariffs could raise prices and even harm national security.",
      "\u201cCanada and Mexico are our top energy trading partners, and maintaining the free flow of energy products across our borders is critical for North American energy security and U.S. consumers,\u201d said Scott Lauermann, speaking for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry\u2019s top lobbying group.",
      "American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents U.S. refineries, also opposes potential tariffs, saying in a statement that \u201cAmerican refiners depend on crude oil from Canada and Mexico to produce the affordable, reliable fuels consumers count on every day.\"",
      "Energy lobbyist Scott Segal said the idea of centering energy decisions at the White House follows an example set by Biden, who named a trio of White House advisers to lead on climate policy. Segal, a partner at the law and policy law firm Bracewell, called Burgum \u201ca steady hand on the tiller\u201d with experience in fossil fuels and renewables.",
      "And unlike Biden\u2019s climate advisers \u2014 Gina McCarthy, John Podesta and Ali Zaidi \u2014 Burgum will probably take his White House post as a Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, Segal said.",
      "Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, called the new energy council \u201ca good thing\u201d for the U.S. economy and trade. \u201cConceptually it makes a lot of sense to have as much coordination as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, \u201cmarket dynamics will always be the key'' for any potential increase in energy production, Meyer said.",
      "Jonathan Elkind, a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, called energy dominance a \u201cdeliberately vague concept,\u201d but said, \u201cIt's hard to see how (Trump) can push more oil into an already saturated market.\"",
      "Trump has promised to bring gasoline prices below $2 a gallon, but experts call that highly unlikely, since crude oil prices would need to drop dramatically to achieve that goal. Gas prices averaged $3.06 nationally as of Friday, down from $3.25 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Elkind and other experts said they hope the new energy council will move beyond oil to focus on renewable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power, as well as nuclear. None of those energy resources produces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.",
      "\"Failure to focus on climate change as an existential threat to our planet is a huge concern and translates to a very significant loss of American property and American lives,'' said Elkind, a former assistant energy secretary in the Obama administration. He cited federal statistics showing two dozen weather disasters this year that caused more than $1 billion in damage each. A total of 418 people were killed.",
      "Trump has played down risks from climate change and pledged to rescind unspent money in the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden\u2019s landmark climate and health care bill. He also said he will stop offshore wind development when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "Even so, his Nov. 15 announcement of the energy council says he will \u201cexpand ALL forms of energy production to grow our Economy and create good-paying jobs.\u201d",
      "That includes renewables, said Safak Yucel, associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business.",
      "\"The mandate for the energy council is U.S. dominance globally, but what's more American than American solar and American wind?'' he asked. A report from Ernst & Young last year showed that solar was the cheapest source of new-build electricity in many markets.",
      "Trump, in his statement, said he wants to dramatically increase baseload power to lower electricity costs, avoid brownouts and \u201cWIN the battle for AI superiority.\"",
      "In comments to reporters before he was named to the energy post, Burgum cited a similar goal, noting increased demand for electricity from artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, and fast-growing data centers. \u201cThe AI battle affects everything from defense to health care to education to productivity as a country,\u2033 Burgum said.",
      "While Trump mocks the climate law as the \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d he is unlikely to repeal it, Yucel and other experts said. One reason: Most of its investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts. GOP members of Congress have urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to retain the law, which passed with only Democratic votes.",
      "\u201cA lot of Southern states are telling Trump, \u2018We actually like renewables,'\" Yucel said, noting that Republican-led states have added thousands of jobs in recent years in wind, solar and battery power.",
      "If renewables make economic economic sense, he added, \"they'll continue.''"

      "\u201cHis tenure was marked by significant strides towards equity, justice, and empowerment for all,\u201d the statement said, adding that memorial arrangements would be forthcoming. The statement did not specify exactly when or where Milner had died.",
      "Milner was the first popularly elected Black mayor in New England. He served as Hartford\u2019s Democratic mayor from 1981 to 1987. He also served as a Connecticut state representative and state senator. He was also a former president and lifetime member of the Greater Hartford NAACP, the organization said.",
      "Democratic Gov.

      "Milner was a descendant of enslaved Black and Native American ancestors, according to a profile of him written by The Associated Press in 2010 upon the release of his memoir \u201cUp from Slavery: A History from Slavery to City Hall in New England.\u201d He was raised by a widowed mother who got by, in part, with help from government assistance.",

    "story": [
      "The 13-year civil war in Syria has roared back into prominence with a surprise rebel offensive on one of Syria\u2019s largest cities and ancient business hub",
      "WASHINGTON -- The 13-year civil war in Syria has roared back into prominence with a surprise rebel offensive on Aleppo, one of Syria's largest cities and an ancient business hub. The push is among the rebels' strongest in years in a war whose destabilizing effects have rippled far beyond the country's borders.",
      "It was the first opposition attack on Aleppo since 2016, when a brutal air campaign by Russian warplanes helped Syrian President Bashar Assad retake the northwestern city. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power, within the 70% of Syria under his control.",
      "The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East, at a time when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups.",
      "Robert Ford, the last-serving U.S. ambassador to Syria, pointed to months of Israeli strikes on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in the area, and to Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon this week, as factors providing Syria\u2019s rebels with the opportunity to advance.",
      "Here's a look at some of the key aspects of the new fighting:",
      "Assad has been at war with opposition forces seeking his overthrow for 13 years, a conflict that's killed an estimated half-million people. Some 6.8 million Syrians have fled the country, a refugee flow that helped change the political map in Europe by fueling anti-immigrant far-right movements.",
      "The roughly 30% of the country not under Assad is controlled by a range of opposition forces and foreign troops. The U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, far from Aleppo, to guard against a resurgence by the Islamic State. Both the U.S. and Israel conduct occasional strikes in Syria against government forces and Iran-allied militias. Turkey has forces in Syria as well, and has influence with the broad alliance of opposition forces storming Aleppo.",
      "Coming after years with few sizeable changes in territory between Syria's warring parties, the fighting \u201chas the potential to be really quite, quite consequential and potentially game-changing,\u201d if Syrian government forces prove unable to hold their ground, said Charles Lister, a longtime Syria analyst with the U.S.-based Middle East Institute. Risks include if Islamic State fighters see it as an opening, Lister said.",
      "Ford said the fighting in Aleppo would become more broadly destabilizing if it drew Russia and Turkey \u2014 each with its own interests to protect in Syria \u2014 into direct heavy fighting against each other.",
      "The U.S. and U.N. have long designated the opposition force leading the attack at Aleppo \u2014 Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known by its initials HTS \u2014 as a terrorist organization.",
      "Abu Mohammed al-Golani emerged as the leader of al-Qaida's Syria branch in 2011, in the first months of Syria's war. It was an unwelcome intervention to many in Syria's opposition, who hoped to keep the fight against Assad's brutal rule untainted by violent extremism.",
      "Golani and his group early on claimed responsibility for deadly bombings, pledged to attack Western forces, confiscated property from religious minorities and sent religious police to enforce modest dress by women.",
      "Golani and HTS have sought to remake themselves in recent years, focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action, researcher Aaron Zelin noted. His group broke ties with al-Qaida in 2016. Golani cracked down on some extremist groups in his territory, and increasingly portrays himself as a protector of other religions. That includes last year allowing the first Christian Mass in the city of Idlib in years.",
      "By 2018, the Trump administration acknowledged it was no longer directly targeting Golani, Zelin said. But HTS has allowed some wanted armed groups to continue to operate on its territory, and shot at U.S. special forces at least as recently as 2022, he said.",
      "At the crossroads of trade routes and empires for thousands of years, Aleppo is one of the centers of commerce and culture in the Middle East.",
      "Aleppo was home to 2.3 million people before the war. Rebels seized the east side of the city in 2012, and it became the proudest symbol of the advance of armed opposition factions.",
      "In 2016, government forces backed by Russian airstrikes laid siege to the city. Russian shells, missiles and crude barrel bombs \u2014 fuel canisters or other containers loaded with explosives and metal \u2014 methodically leveled neighborhoods. Starving and under siege, rebels surrendered Aleppo that year.",
      "The Russian military's entry was the turning point in the war, allowing Assad to stay on in the territory he held.",
      "This year, Israeli airstrikes in Aleppo have hit Hezbollah weapons depots and Syrian forces, among other targets, according to an independent monitoring group. Israel rarely acknowledges strikes at Aleppo and other government-held areas of Syria."

      "Missouri's Republican attorney general says he still considers it illegal to provide abortions after fetal viability, despite a newly approved state abortion rights amendment",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Missouri's Republican attorney general has pledged to enforce some laws restricting abortion despite a new constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "In an opinion requested by incoming GOP governor Mike Kehoe, Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote that his office will continue enforcing a ban on abortion after fetal viability.",
      "There is an exception carved out in the amendment for cases in which a health care provider deems an abortion necessary to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder the express terms of the amendment, the government may still protect innocent life after viability,\u201d Bailey wrote. \u201cThe statutes thus remain generally enforceable after viability.\u201d",
      "Bailey said his office also will continue to honor a Missouri law requiring parental permission for minors to receive abortions.",
      "Bailey's opinion comes after voters approved a ballot measure this month that enshrines abortion rights in the state constitution while allowing lawmakers to restrict or ban it after fetal viability.",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "The measure\u2019s passage was one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates this past election, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri sued the day after the election to invalidate the state\u2019s abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care. That lawsuit is still pending.",
      "Allowing restrictions on abortions after viability was a sticking point for some abortion rights supporters in Missouri.",
      "Advocates had worried that failing to include such limits would sink their chances of passing abortion protections. But others cautioned against giving the Republican-controlled Legislature the power to enact regulations that could effectively end access."

    "story": [
      "Mohamed Al Fayed manipulated Harrods managers to conceal his crimes, sacking those he could not control, an ex-director has told the BBC.",
      "Jon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed's private office for 18 months, says the late entrepreneur plied him with envelopes full of cash - totalling about $50,000 (\u00a339,000)  - to try to compromise and control him.",
      "\u201cHe tried to own you. And ultimately, I got fired because I couldn't be bought,\u201d he says.",
      "Harrods didn't respond to Mr Brilliant's claims. It has previously said that it was \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the abuse allegations, adding that it is a \u201cvery different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Brilliant says he was \u201chorrified\u201d when he first heard the allegations that Al Fayed had abused hundreds of women and says he \u201cbeat himself up\u201d about whether there was anything he should have questioned more.",
      "He told the BBC about surveillance, sackings, and a culture designed to keep top managers from trusting or communicating with one another.",
      "This made it harder for them to do their duty as directors to exercise independent judgement and check Al Fayed\u2019s power - or ask questions which may have revealed more to them about how he was treating women.",
      "\u201cI 100% can see how the management structure and culture was set up to cover it up, mask it from people,\u201d says Mr Brilliant.",
      "Four other former directors have anonymously confirmed elements of this picture.",
      "A US citizen, Mr Brilliant was 36 when he joined the firm in August 2000. He was hired to relaunch the Harrods online business.",
      "He says that shortly before his first business trip to visit Microsoft in Seattle, Al Fayed gave him a brown envelope containing $5,000 (\u00a33,993) in $50 notes.",
      "After the trip he tried to return the full amount. He says Al Fayed refused, asking him, \u201cYou didn't need any entertainment?\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant replied that he did not need it - he had been too busy to visit the cinema or theatre, and someone else had paid for dinner.",
      "Receiving cash ahead of business trips - large-value notes of pounds, francs or dollars depending on his destination - continued over the following six months.",
      "Three senior colleagues suggested to Mr Brilliant at the time that Al Fayed was trying to get him to compromise himself.",
      "Mr Brilliant says they told him: \u201cHe was trying to get you to come back and say \u2018oh, I spent money on drugs or I spent money frolicking, doing something that I shouldn't have been doing,\u2019 and that he would then use that information against you if you should ever turn on him.\u201d",
      "He adds: \u201cI am certainly aware of people who... succumbed to the temptation.\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant continued trying to return the money, until his family arrived in London and he started looking for a home. With Al Fayed\u2019s consent, he put it towards the purchase of a property.",
      "Al Fayed had form for using envelopes of cash as a tool of power and control. It had caused a scandal in the 1990s after he paid MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons - and then exposed those who had accepted his gifts.",
      "Mr Brilliant believes he was not immune to Al Fayed\u2019s extensive use of bugging and surveillance, carried out by the Harrods owner\u2019s large team of security guards.",
      "\u201cEven when I tell this story to you right now, I get kind of goosebumps and the hair stands up on the back of my neck, realising that my phones were being listened in on,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant\u2019s first suspicion that he may have been bugged came in 2002, shortly before he was fired. After a disagreement about the funding of Fulham FC, words from a private phone conversation with someone in the US were quoted back to him in a meeting.",
      "Another former Harrods director, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us he had moved into an Al Fayed-owned property when he started at the store and one of the security team warned him it was bugged.",
      "The director says he and his wife would jokingly say \u201cgood morning\u201d to the security guards who might be listening when they woke up.",
      "He noticed that many directors kept a personal mobile phone as well as a work phone, because they feared the Harrods phone might be bugged.",
      "Mr Brilliant, who has returned to the US, says he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d when he first heard the BBC investigation.",
      "\u201cI do look back and say, \u2018should I have seen something? Did I miss something?\u2019 And I've gone over it and over it,\u201d he says.",
      "He worked in Al Fayed\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d office suite on the fifth floor of Harrods, protected by two sets of security doors. There was a group of administrative assistants who were all young, blonde and attractive - he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant recalls them as \u201cobedient\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere was this notion of \u2018do this, jump, how high should I jump?\u2019 - and really being on the ball. Mohamed demanded a lot of people, and they were serving their role.\u201d",
      "He adds that he now questions whether the women acted in that way because of what may had been happening.",
      "When challenged on whether he should have done more to protect the women he says he asks himself whether he could have.",
      "\u201cI wasn't privy to that amount of information that would otherwise suggest that there was something deeper going on.\u201d",
      "'Frontal lobotomy'",
      "Mr Brilliant says Harrods\u2019 managers were set in opposition to each other and then expected to keep a watchful eye on their rivals.",
      "In addition to his core role, he was given partial oversight of a range of Al Fayed\u2019s interests, including Fulham FC and the Paris Ritz.",
      "\u201cI was asked to oversee people I had no right overseeing,\u201d says Mr Brilliant. In turn, he found that \u201cpeople were looking over my shoulder\u201d.",
      "Information was treated like a \u201ccurrency\u201d and people would jockey to share it to \u201ccurry favour\u201d with the boss, he says.",
      "This has been corroborated by an anonymous director. \u201cThere was no trust between directors,\u201d he told us. \u201cEveryone was on the defensive.\u201d",
      "In his 1997 biography of Al Fayed, journalist Tom Bower described Harrods as a \u201cmedieval court\u201d where executives\u2019 survival depended on \u201cutter loyalty\u201d and \u201ca drip of salacious gossip to sow doubts about rivals\u201d.",
      "Senior managers at Harrods were sacked with such regularity that Mr Brilliant says it was a \u201crunning joke\u201d in the store.",
      "Managers were sacked or quit so frequently that The Sunday Times began to publish a regular count, which reached 48 in 2005 - before a legal letter put a stop to it.",
      "Many dismissals ended in legal action or employment tribunals. Some were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), although Mr Brilliant was not.",
      "But some managers lasted for more than a decade. And to do that, you had to have a \u201cfrontal lobotomy\u201d said Mr Brilliant.",
      "Some, he felt, were compromised and couldn\u2019t speak out. For the others, \u201cI think you had to just do what you were told to do, do it with a smile\u2026 No original thought, no willing to challenge the status quo, just willing to accept.\u201d",
      "The BBC has tried to contact as many long-serving former Harrods directors as possible, but none were willing to give an interview.",
      "Although he only worked there for 18 months, Mr Brilliant said he wanted to speak to the BBC for two reasons.",
      "\u201cOne, if there's anything that I'm able to say or do that shows support for these women who have been horrifically treated, traumatised, I want to do whatever I can.",
      "\u201cSecondly, my hope is that by my willingness to speak out, others will come and speak out themselves.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",
      "However, some say the regulator lacks the teeth to deal with the problem.",
      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

      "UK car production fell sharply in October amid industry concerns about \"intense pressure\" on investment in electric vehicle-making.",
      "Output of all cars dropped by more than 15% from a year earlier, mainly due to a fall in exports following weak demand, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.",
      "Production of electric and hybrid vehicles declined by a third compared with last year, due to flagging European demand and the retooling of factories for new models.",
      "The figures come after Vauxhall maker Stellantis said this week it would close its Luton van-making factory, partly due to rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles in the UK.",
      "In addition, Ford said last week it would cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years because of difficult trading conditions, including intense competition and less demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said: \"These are deeply concerning times for the automotive industry, with massive investments in plants and new zero emission products under intense pressure.\"",
      "Globally, demand for EVs has slowed, he said, while in the UK, manufacturers have to contend with \"the toughest targets and most accelerated timeline\" without the incentives necessary for customers to drive demand.",
      "Although production of EVs fell in October, sales of electric cars in the UK have been increasing.",
      "In October, they made up one out of every five cars registered, although industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "There has been a growing row between the government and the industry over the sale of new petrol and diesel cars being phased out over the next few years.",
      "Under the UK's zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.",
      "In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise.",
      "For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine - but they can also buy \"credits\" from firms that can meet this mandate.",

      "He said troubles for Stellantis' UK plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port \"started with Brexit\" because it \"caused a lot of uncertainty\".",
      "\"When you've got two UK plants that export 80%+ of their build, with the tariff confusion and no clarity that really hurt the two plants.\"",
      "He added that for the ZEV mandate the government \"has to decide: is this a tax, a \u00a36bn tax on the car companies, or is it their mandate to go green?\"",
      "\"They need to make it possible for the car manufacturers to meet these targets,\" he said.",

      "\"If everybody bought an electric vehicle tomorrow, I don\u2019t see how we charge them,\" he said.",
      "However, Vicky Read, chief executive of EV charging industry body Charge UK, told the BBC a charger \"is being installed every 25 minutes\".",
      "Charging rollout is reliant on private sector funding, so talk of electric car targets being weakened is \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d, she said.",

      "\"Companies don't always see how quickly these markets can change, and then they can get left behind,\" he said.",

      "Drivers are paying more for fuel than they should because retailers' profit margins remain \"stubbornly high\", the competition watchdog has said.",

      "It said supermarkets' margins had risen to 8.1% in August from 7% in April.",
      "The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said sellers were pricing fuel as \u201clow as possible in a highly competitive market\u201d while also grappling with increasing costs.",
      "But the CMA said the \"sustained\" increase in fuel prices was concerning and there was not enough competition in the fuel market, which continued to drive prices up.",
      "Non-supermarket fuel margins had risen to 10.2% in August from 7.8% in April, the watchdog said.",
      "\u201cWhile fuel prices have fallen since July, drivers are paying more for fuel than they should be as they continue to be squeezed by stubbornly high fuel margins,\" said Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA.",
      "\"We therefore remain concerned about weak competition in the sector and the impact on pump prices,\" he added, especially while costs of living remain high.",
      "\"The more people save on fuel, the more they have to spend in other areas\", he said.",

      "However, the PRA's executive director, Gordon Balmer, said it was crucial that the  increasing costs facing retailers - notably business rates, National Insurance and the minimum wage  - were included in future analysis to \"give a complete picture\".",

      "He added that as retailers now have to pay increased National Insurance contributions, higher wages and increased energy bills, it was hard to see what a \"reasonable addition\" was to fuel prices, and what counted as \"bloated margins\".",
      "Motoring group RAC said the CMA's findings were \"disappointing\", especially after the regulator said in July that drivers had been overcharged on fuel by \u00a31.6bn in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe hope the introduction of the government-backed fuel finder scheme next year will succeed in driving greater competition and enable drivers all around the UK to benefit from fairer prices\", said the RAC's Simon Williams.",

    "story": [
      "Major sanitary pad makers in China are apologising after being accused of selling pads that are shorter than advertised.",
      "It comes amid a storm of anger after viral social media videos showed Chinese women measuring the lengths of sanitary pads from popular brands - showing that most of them fell short of what was stated on their packaging.",
      "The uproar has extended into broader grievances about women being short-changed by feminine hygiene products, which have a history of safety scandals in China.",
      "Chinese women have taken it upon themselves to call out quality concerns in sanitary pads, the most commonly used feminine hygiene product in the country.",
      "In one of the earliest videos, posted on 3 November, a user on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu examined nine brands of sanitary pads with a measuring tape, showing that they all fell short of the length stated on their packaging.",
      "\"Will cutting a few centimetres help you strike it rich?\" the user wrote in her video.",
      "The revelations soon ignited widespread criticism, with consumers accusing sanitary pad makers of being deceitful.",
      "\"The inflated sanitary pad length is just like the insoles under men\u2019s feet,\" reads one popular Weibo post.",
      "Amid the uproar, an investigation of over 20 different sanitary pads by Chinese news outlet The Paper found that nearly 90% of the products were \"shrunken\", measuring at least 10mm shorter than claimed on their packaging. Tucked within most of them were even shorter absorbent layers, which are meant to soak up menstrual flow.",
      "The Paper also reported that while national standards for sanitary pads specify that the products can measure within 4% of advertised lengths, they do not specify the length of the absorbent layer in sanitary pads.",
      "Following a torrent of complaints, authorities said they were revising the current national standard on sanitary pads, according to local media.",
      "Met with enquiries and complaints from customers about the discrepancy in its sanitary pad lengths, the popular Chinese brand ABC further stoked outrage after its customer service reportedly responded to a complaint by saying \"if you cannot accept [the length difference] then you can choose not to buy it\".",
      "ABC said in a statement in mid-November that it was \"deeply sorry\" for the \"inappropriate\" response, and promised to improve its products to achieve \"zero deviation\". Other companies including Shecare and Beishute have also issued apologies.",
      "Chinese state media has also weighed in on the controversy, criticising manufacturers for cutting corners.",
      "\"As a daily necessity for women, quality of sanitary pads is directly related to the health and comfort of the user,\" reads a Xinhua article. \"The problems existing in some products on the market cannot be ignored.\"",
      "Sanitary pads are the most commonly used feminine hygiene product in China, where the market is valued at $13bn (\u00a310bn). However, the products have also made headlines over the years for safety issues.",
      "In 2016, police busted a massive \"fake sanitary towel\" operation in southeast China, where millions of sanitary pads were manufactured in a factory without proper hygiene measures and packaged as popular brands. In 2021, popular feminine hygiene brand Space 7 apologised and vowed an investigation after a woman claimed she found a needle in one of its sanitary pads.",
      "The wave of anger also reflects broader grievances felt by women over the quality of products meant for them.",
      "\"Is it that hard for sanitary pads to tackle women\u2019s needs?\" reads a trending hashtag on Weibo.",
      "Another trending phrase that has caught on amid the blowback encapsulates the outrage: \"Sanitary pads yield a centimetre; women yield for a lifetime.\""

    "story": [
      "Ford UK has called on the government to introduce incentives to encourage drivers to buy electric vehicles (EVs) as an industry backlash grows over sales targets.",
      "Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told the BBC that without demand, a government mandate to produce and sell more EVs \"just doesn't work\".",
      "The comments add to a growing row between the government and the industry over the sale of new petrol and diesel cars being phased out over the next few years.",
      "On Tuesday, Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall, said it would close a plant in Luton, putting 1,100 jobs at risk, partly due to the EV targets.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Stellantis's decision was \"a dark day for Luton\".",
      "It joins Ford in axing UK jobs. Last week, it announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years, partly due to the EV target but also because of increased competition.",
      "Ms Brankin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "She said Ford has invested \"significantly\" in the production and development of EVs, with \"well over\" \u00a3350m put into electrification in the UK.",
      "\"So we kind of need to make it work,\" she said.",
      "Both firms have previously raised doubts about their future in the UK because of other factors, separate to EV targets.",
      "Ford closed its Bridgend factory in 2020, axing 1,644 jobs, citing Covid-19 as one of the reasons while Vauxhall's former owner suggested in 2019 that Brexit threatened its Luton factory.",
      "Meanwhile, some analysts have said a shift towards luxury vehicles and away from cheaper models are also part of the reason for Ford's problems.",
      "Reynolds blamed the previous government for Stellantis' Luton closure, saying Labour had \"inherited a position of extreme frustration\".",
      "He said there would be a \"fast track\" consultation of how the EV targets are enforced, but reiterated Labour's commitment to a 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.",
      "However, shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the 2030 target was a \"jobs killer\" and that Stellantis' decision was \"the direct result of a government policy that is simply unworkable for industry\".",
      "The previous Conservative government moved the deadline for the phase-out from 2030 to 2035, but it kept penalties for non-compliance.",
      "Under the current mandate, a percentage of the cars that companies sell must qualify as zero-emission.",
      "EVs must make up 22% of a company's car sales and 10% of its van sales this year.",
      "For every car sale outside of that, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine.",
      "That target is set to rise to 28% for cars and 16% for vans in 2025. The rules will then get tougher every year ahead of a complete ban of new petrol and diesel car sales.",

      "What does net zero mean?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Discounting",
      "There are flexibilities in the current system, allowing manufacturers that can\u2019t meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can.",
      "In practice, this means firms could buy credits from companies such as Tesla or Chinese firm BYD, which build electric models exclusively.",
      "Manufacturers argue that demand for electric cars has not been as high as was expected when the rules were drawn up.",
      "As a result, to avoid fines, they say they are having to discount new vehicles heavily, or subsidise rivals that only build electric cars, none of whom have a manufacturing base in the UK.",
      "Sales of electric cars have, however, been increasing. In October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "Reynolds told an industry audience at a dinner hosted by Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) on Tuesday he is \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d about the way zero-emissions policies currently operate.",

      "A number of options have been suggested, such as allowing sales credits to be transferred between cars and vans and giving \"credits\" for British-made EVs sold abroad.",
      "The SMMT has called for urgent government intervention to safeguard the sector, warning that weak demand for electric cars and the requirement to fulfil sales quotas had \"the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\".",

    "story": [
      "Supermarket loyalty cards do offer genuine savings, the UK's competition watchdog has found, but it said people should still shop around.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at 50,000 products on loyalty price promotions across Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Co-op and Waitrose.",
      "It found \"very little evidence\" that supermarkets were inflating their \"usual\" prices to make promotions look like a better deal.",
      "However, it found that despite discounts being legitimate many shoppers still did not trust that the offers were cheaper.",
      "While the CMA also said its review \"has shown that loyalty prices aren\u2019t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key\".",
      "\"We know many people don\u2019t trust loyalty card prices,\" said George Lusty, the CMA's interim executive director of consumer protection. \"Which is why we did a deep dive to get to the bottom of whether supermarkets were treating shoppers fairly.\"",

      "How a big yellow label influences what we buy",
      "It said about nine out of 10 loyalty promotions it looked at offered genuine savings against the usual in-store price.",
      "Customers made an average saving of between 17% and 25% across the five supermarkets the CMA examined.",
      "The watchdog also surveyed shoppers and said that nearly 70% of those it spoke to think loyalty pricing offers decent savings.",
      "However, there remains a significant amount of mistrust among consumers towards loyalty promotions.",
      "The CMA said: \"A significant proportion - 40% - say they do not trust loyalty prices are a genuine saving on the usual price.\"",
      "A common view among younger people was that non-member prices in a promotion were higher than normal.",
      "More than 70% of 18 to 29-year-olds thought that the price for those without a loyalty card or app had been bumped up, said the CMA.",
      "While the report examined other supermarkets, it did not draw any conclusions about two of the UK's largest - Asda and Aldi.",
      "Asda has a loyalty points scheme which customers can redeem for vouchers but it does not offer lower prices on a product for those with a loyalty card.",
      "Discounters Aldi and Lidl were not included as they don't sell online, and don't stock a wide enough range of branded products to do a like-for-like comparison, the watchdog said.",
      "Consumer group Which? said two-tier pricing had \"become a common practice across retailers\" so it was \"reassuring\" that people could make genuine savings.",
      "However, it has also studied thousands of products, \"and repeatedly found examples of loyalty price offers that aren't as good as they seem\" according to Sue Davies, Which? head of food policy.",
      "She also said there are concerns that \"millions of consumers are being excluded from accessing lower prices due to loyalty scheme restrictions\" because they have not signed up to a card or app.",
      "Shoppers have been under pressure from the pace of food price rises in recent years, the CMA said.",
      "Although inflation has fallen considerably since then, it said the price of food is still substantially higher relative to how much money people earn.",
      "Customer data",
      "One of the main reasons supermarkets offer loyalty schemes is so they can collect data on customers.",
      "This is very valuable information - studying buying decisions can help supermarkets understand and influence shoppers.",
      "They create highly detailed shopper profiles looking at what people bought and how often.",
      "Some supermarkets sell data to suppliers which can then be used to deliver targeted advertising.",
      "Selling data can be lucrative. Sainsbury's has said it expects Nectar360, the group which manages the supermarket's loyalty scheme, to make an additional \u00a3100m in profit over the next three years.",
      "The CMA said shopper attitudes to data collection range from feeling pressure to trade their personal data for lower prices, to others not feeling concerned.",
      "But only 7% of people surveyed by the watchdog said they hadn't signed up to a loyalty scheme due to privacy concerns.",
      "Annich McIntosh, editor and chief executive of Loyalty Magazine, said there was a question mark over whether it was morally right to force people to participate in loyalty schemes to get price promotions.",
      "But she said these schemes in general benefit shoppers because they can help slow down supermarket price increases.",
      "She added that a \"sci-fi scenario\" of customers being offered promotions as they walk past a product was unlikely, as there was little customer appetite.",

      "Then Donald Trump was re-elected as US president.",
      "\"I'm like, okay, we've got to bring those in,\" said Ms Mosee, founder of MinkeeBlue, a small business based in Philadelphia. Her firm is one of the many thousands across the country preparing for the potential impact of Trump's promises to impose stiff new tariffs on all goods coming into the country.",
      "Those efforts gained urgency this week as Trump said he would take action on his first day in office. He aimed the measures - a kind of border tax - at China, Mexico and Canada, America's top three trade partners.",
      "Writing on social media, Trump said he planned to impose a 25% levy on goods from Canada and Mexico and \"an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" on imports from China.",
      "The post followed his campaign pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of at least 10% on all imports coming into the US, and 60% or more on goods from China - many of which already face steep duties left over from actions taken during his first term as president.",
      "Some experts have said that Trump's policies may ultimately prove less aggressive than promised, and that his statements should be understood as opening salvos in bigger negotiations of migration and drug policy.",
      "But regardless of how policy shakes out, the threats are already having economic consequences, as firms like MinkeeBlue start to stockpile, shift supply chains, re-work contracts and take other steps to guard against the possible impact.",

      "Chris Caton, managing director for global strategy and analytics at warehouse giant Prologis, said his firm had already seen an uptick in activity \"on the margin\" as businesses respond to possible tariffs by looking for space to stock up.",
      "\"There's economic impact whether it's bluster or not,\" said economist Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",
      "In the days after the election, footwear giant Steve Madden told investors that it was moving forward with plans to shift manufacturing outside of China, with the aim of cutting its imports from the country in half over the next year.",
      "Tool and hardware maker Stanley Black & Decker also said it had initiated conversations with its customers about price hikes tied to the tariffs.",
      "Executives at retail giants such as Walmart have discussed similar plans.",
      "Even if Trump's policies remain just talk, Ms Edelberg said the public could see higher prices, as well as possible shortages of some items, as hoarding left some firms scrambling.",
      "Just the simple fact that firms were unsure about what was going to happen was also likely to reduce economic growth in the months ahead, she added.",
      "\"Even if firms don't think that these tariffs are going to happen with 100% certainty, it's not zero, so they should be responding,\" Ms Edelberg said.",
      "Trump and his advisers have argued that tariffs will help revive US manufacturing and drive a new US jobs boom.",
      "But that can come at a cost, businesses owners and economists warn.",
      "Martin Pochtaruk, chief executive of Canadian solar panel maker Heliene, said his firm was nearly wiped out in 2018 when Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made solar panels and it had to absorb the fees.",
      "The firm now does all of its manufacturing in the US, where it employs 400 people. Many of its suppliers have also set up shop in the US, lured by government incentives for renewable energy introduced by President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr Pochtaruk's firm has learned from its experience, changing the design of its contracts so that customers are responsible for unexpected cost changes - whether due to tariffs or the kind of price spikes that hit during the pandemic.",
      "But despite these protections, the possibility of renewed trade tension between countries as closely connected as Canada and the US was worrying, Mr Pochtaruk said.",
      "Some key materials - such as glass - still come from overseas and face likely price hikes. The new administration could also bring other policies that slow growth in the industry.",
      "\"We are talking to all of our clients,\" Mr Pochtaruk said. \"There is a lot of anxiety.\"",
      "Economists say the evidence from existing tariffs - which have been present for decades in sectors such as clothing and footwear - suggests that while they can protect some firms, the cost is high and they do little to boost overall employment, while raising prices for US companies and consumers.",
      "The National Retail Federation (NRF) has warned that tariffs along the lines of Trump's campaign proposals would cost US consumers between $46bn (\u00a336.6bn) and $78bn more annually for apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods.",
      "By NRF estimates, a $40 toaster, for example, would rise in price to $48-$52, while a $50 pair of athletic shoes could jump to $59-$64.",
      "Trump's move on Monday to target Mexico - a key supplier of grocery staples such as fruits and vegetables and historically protected by a free-trade agreement - underscores the tension between his tariff promises and other pledges on the campaign trail to bring down prices for Americans.",
      "Viktor Shvets of Macquarie Capital said that although Trump's ideas were in conflict with each other, he believed in the end Trump's fear of disrupting financial markets would limit his trade actions.",
      "\"Risks are high, but we remain convinced that 'guardrails' are sufficiently robust to avoid the worst outcomes,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 21:29:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Motor giant Stellantis says it is closing the van making plant in the context of the UK's rules on electric vehicle sales.",
    "story": [
      "The owner of Vauxhall has announced plans to close its van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "Stellantis, which also owns brands including Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, said it would combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.",
      "Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said.",
      "Union Unite said the move was a \"complete slap in the face\" for its members working in Luton.",
      "There are growing concerns among car manufacturers over EV sales targets, with many, including Stellantis, calling for the government to do more to boost consumer demand.",
      "Following the Luton plant announcement and intense pressure from industry leaders, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government would consult on changes to EV sales rules, which is officially called the zero-emission vehicles mandate, because it is not working as intended.",
      "\"I get the seriousness and the urgency of the situation,\" he said, adding that the decision to close the Vauxhall van factory was a \"difficult day for Luton\".",
      "Late on Tuesday, the car industry called for urgent government intervention \"to safeguard the sector and Britain\u2019s zero emission vehicle transition\".",
      "The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said weak demand for EVs and the requirement to fulfill sales quotas would cost carmakers \u00a36bn in 2024 alone, \"with the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\".",
      "It said the strong EV demand anticipated when the zero emissions mandate was designed more than two years ago had failed to materialise, with interest rates, raw material prices, and energy costs remaining high.",
      "However, Reynolds reaffirmed that the government remained committed to meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto target of ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.",
      "As part of the shift to electric, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of the 2030 ban, with quotas increasing each year.",
      "Current rules state EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales in 2024.",
      "For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine. There are flexibilities in the system, allowing manufacturers who cannot meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can.",
      "But car brands with factories in the UK have been urging the government to relax the rules, arguing that EV demand is not strong enough and more incentives are required for drivers to go fully electric.",
      "Electric car targets could be eased as demand flags",
      "Car firms demand more help to meet 2030 petrol ban",
      "Stellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it.",
      "Electric models from other Stellantis brands, including Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat, were also set to be built there. Vauxhall's Luton director said at the time it would be a \"fitting way\" to mark the factory's 120th anniversary.",
      "Now, the electric model that had been scheduled for manufacturing at Luton will move to Ellesmere Port, which is to get a \u00a350m cash injection.",
      "Three years ago, Stellantis invested \u00a3100m into revamping the Ellesmere Port site to make electric vehicles. It currently builds a range of small electric vans.",
      "Production of Stellantis's conventional vans will be transferred to France",
      "The company said the closure of Luton in spring next year would \"potentially contribute to greater production efficiency\". The decision to consolidate production is subject to consultation.",
      "It said hundreds of permanent jobs would be created at Ellesmere Port and that it would provide relocation assistance to workers who wanted to transfer from Luton.",
      "But Unite said \"whatever the positive benefits\" in store for the Ellesmere Port site, the decision was \"not acceptable\".",
      "\u201cWe stand ready to support our members in doing whatever we can to ensure that historical vehicle manufacturing is maintained in Luton,\" the union said.",
      "Luton's Vauxhall factory opened in 1905, with the first vans being assembled there in 1932.",
      "At its height the plant employed 37,000 people, but that number has been falling since the 1960s. The final car rolled off the production line in 2002, though van manufacturing, with the production of the Vivaro model, continued.",
      "Earlier this year, Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares warned that the future of both Luton and Ellesmere Port were in doubt, citing the impact of the EV sales mandate.",
      "'Major concern'",
      "Nissan, which builds EVs at its plant in Sunderland, has said the EV sales rules are \"undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment\".",
      "Last week, its rival Ford announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years. It said this was partly because of weaker demand for EVs.",
      "The SMMT has previously said support packages and incentives are needed to make the electric vehicles switch more attractive and affordable.",
      "Sales of electric cars have been increasing - in October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the industry did not want to \"water down any commitments\", but said \"workable regulation - backed with incentives - will set us up for success\".",
      "The SMMT said Stellantis's announcement was a \"major concern to UK automotive manufacturing but, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many\".",
      "The government said it was backing the car industry with more than \u00a3300m to \"drive uptake of zero-emission vehicles\"."

But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",

      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "But the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.",
      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",
      "That will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.",
      "\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign...  means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century\u2019s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",
      "\"No one wanted to miss out on the next Tesla,\" laughs Mr Fehrm.",

      "\"She is opening up the conversation about the sorts of places that have inspired her.\"",
      "And as those places start to disappear, Moxi's hopeful that Charli's fanbase will discover a love of club music that has been on the wane.",

      "\"She's the first in our first generation to make that crossover,\" she says.",

      "The decision to block the grant, taken by Badenoch when she was business and trade minister, was described in court by Kneecap's barrister as \"unlawful and procedurally unfair\".",
      "In a statement, the band said Badenoch and her department had \"tried to silence us and they have failed\".",
      "The band said it would split the \u00a314,250 equally between two youth organisations who work with Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland \"to create a better future for our young people\".",
      "Kneecap originally applied for a grant allocated to support UK-registered artists in global markets in December 2023.",
      "The group, who have faced controversy for their lyrics and political outlook, were successful in their application, but were subsequently blocked from receiving the funding after an intervention by the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "At the time, then-UK Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch's spokesperson said they did not want to hand taxpayers' money \"to people that oppose the United Kingdom itself\".",
      "The band's music and marketing heavily features themes relating to Irish republicanism and opposition to British rule in Northern Ireland.",
      "The group have courted controversy and it claimed it was told a 2019 tour, entitled Farewell to the Union, had angered the then Conservative government.",
      "Kneecap have also antagonised unionists in Northern Ireland - one of their best known records is called Get Your Brits Out, a parody rap in which the band go on an imaginary, drug-fuelled night out with prominent members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).",
      "In statement following Friday's court hearing, band member DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed said: \"For us this action was never about \u00a314,250, it could have been 50p.\"",
      "The group said its motivation for taking the case was \"equality\".",
      "\"This was an attack on artistic culture, an attack on the Good Friday Agreement itself and an attack on Kneecap and our way of expressing ourselves.\"",
      "In a statement following the settlement, Badeonch's spokesperson said \"this case is not about whether a band promotes violence or hates the UK, as Kneecap clearly do; this is about whether government ministers have the ability to stop taxpayers' money subsidising people who neither need nor deserve it\".",
      "\"Labour would rather waste your money than stand up to a group of Irish republicans who go to court because the UK government won\u2019t hand them cash.\"",
      "'Generosity and support'",
      "Kneecap have said it will split the money awarded to them between two Belfast charities, Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na in Ballymurphy and RCity Belfast on the Shankill Road.",
      "Sarah Jane Waite, director of RCity Belfast, expressed the charity's thanks for the \"generosity and support from Kneecap\".",
      "She said the donation will be used toward a number of projects, including both local and international programmes.",
      "Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh, executive director of Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na, said it was a \"pleasant surprise\" to receive news about the funding.",
      "The club, based in west Belfast, was previously attended by Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh, known by his stage name Mo Chara.",
      "Mr Mac Ionnrachtaigh added that they are a grassroots group in a disadvantaged area, and the money will be put to \"good use\" including towards the construction of a new building.",
      "\"The key for us is... 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement, we have built a sector through the medium of Irish, but we're still finding ourselves in mobile huts and substandard accommodation,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.",
      "\"This donation goes to the heart of that.\"",
      "Mr Mac Ionnrachtaigh said Mo Chara was part of the \"new generation\" of Irish-medium youth availing of the Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na's services, and added he would be speaking to the group on Friday evening to thank them for the donation.",
      "\"The idea of creating social change through youth, through art, through culture is what Kneecap are ultimately about and what both of these youth projects are ultimately about,\" he said.",
      "\"This funding today will go a long way to elevate that.\"",
      "Who are Kneecap?",
      "Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio from west Belfast who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.",
      "The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap and DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed.",

      "\"This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm,\" Hanni said.",

      "Ador maintains that its contract with NewJeans remains valid as it has not violated its duty and has asked the group to \"continue their activities\" with the agency.",
      "\"A unilateral claim that trust has been broken does not constitute valid grounds for termination of a contract,\" Ador said in the statement after the group's announcement.",
      "\"We regret that the press conference on the termination of the contract took place without sufficient consideration, and even before we gave our response to the demand letter,\" the agency said.",

      "They said that failure to meet their demands would result in the termination of their contracts.",
      "The group has asked for an apology for a comment allegedly made by an executive at Belift Lab, another subsidiary of Hybe, and accused the company of workplace bullying. They have also asked for the immediate reinstatement of Min.",
      "They added that they would fulfil their contractual obligations, but at the conference warned their fans they might not be able to use the band's name after the contract terminates.",
      "Prior to the NewJeans' announcement, the band were committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029.",
      "The contract includes a clause specifying that parties can unilaterally terminate the contract if the other has violated its duty.

      "When planning consent was given to redevelop the site in 2001, a condition was put in place allowing members of the public open access to certain areas of the building.",
      "However, Westminster City Council's planning committee has voted unanimously to end the practice after hearing the BBC\u2019s concerns over terrorism and disruptive protests, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reported.",
      "Councillors heard Broadcasting House had been the target of 158 incidents this year, with BBC staff harassed on the street.",

      "The BBC's application argued two reception areas, the Radio Theatre and the Media Cafe, should remain permanently closed to members of the public who had not received security checks upon entering the building, at Portland Place in central London.",
      "Access to the public had already been restricted since 2017 as a consequence of terrorist activity, according to the application, which also mentioned Covid as a factor.",
      "Lesley Smith, the BBC\u2019s in-house counsel, said: \u201cWe do try to be as open and as accessible as possible but there is also a responsibility to safeguard the continuity and availability of the services and the safety of staff and others.\"",

      "The corporation added it remained committed to allowing public access to New Broadcasting House and pointed out it allowed schools, family members of BBC staff, community groups and audience members to visit.",
      "However, it said a security assessment found that since 2019 Broadcasting House had been targeted by 119 protests and that reopening the reception areas would leave the building susceptible to protesters entering undetected.",
      "The assessment also cited instances of criminal damage, including to a statue above the entrance to Old Broadcasting House, and an incident in which red paint was thrown on to the doors at the entrance to New Broadcasting House.",

    "summary": "The rapper was denied bail after being accused of trying to contact witnesses from behind bars.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been denied bail for the third time by a judge in New York City.",
      "Two judges previously denied Mr Combs's release from custody, primarily due to concerns about potential witness tampering, deeming it a significant risk if he was freed before trial, which is scheduled for May 2025.",
      "Mr Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution.",
      "He has entered a plea of not guilty and has also denied more than two dozen sexual assault accusations lodged in a flurry of civil lawsuits.",
      "The judge cited evidence in the case showing Mr Combs\u2019s alleged attempts at witness tampering, his violation of prison regulations while behind bars and claims he ran a \"criminal enterprise\" including forced labour and kidnapping.",
      "US District Judge Arun Subramanian concluded the court could not trust Mr Combs if released on bail.",
      "\u201cThe Court finds that the government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community,\" the judge wrote in Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Prosecutors had opposed granting Mr Combs bail, citing his misconduct while in custody.",
      "In a recent court filing, prosecutors accused the rap mogul of misusing jail communications to influence witnesses in his case and coercing others in his orbit to post online in order to sway public opinion and benefit his defence.",
      "But defence attorneys for Mr Combs said he should be released so he has adequate time to prepare for his trial next year.",
      "Earlier this month, Judge Subramanian ordered prosecutors in the case to destroy all copies of nearly 20 pages seized during a recent search of the former hip-hop star\u2019s jail cell.",
      "Some of the documents included handwritten notes to his attorneys and thoughts on his legal strategy, court filings show.",

      "Diddy called witnesses from prison, prosecutors say",
      "Diddy faces more than two dozen lawsuits as he sits in jail",
      "Mr Combs's legal team said the search was unlawful and that the material was subject to attorney-client privilege, a legal doctrine that safeguards confidential communications between lawyers and those they represent.",
      "But prosecutors said the information wasn't protected due to Mr Combs's alleged actions, which could be considered obstruction of justice and witness tampering.",
      "They claimed Mr Combs had encouraged his children to post a video on social media featuring their birthday celebration with the aim of swaying prospective jurors.",
      "Allegedly, Mr Combs sent hundreds of text messages using an app called ContactMeASAP, marketed as \"an innovative text messaging service for federal inmates to communicate with loved ones via real-time messages\".",
      "According to authorities, Mr Combs has maintained two accounts on the platform, communicating with dozens of individuals, including attorneys and others not listed on his approved contacts list at the jail.",
      "Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Dawn Richard, who filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Combs in September, also alleges that he was contacting witnesses from prison.",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, she said one person had called her client a liar, and that phone tracking showed this person had had more than 100 points of contact with Mr Combs from jail.",
      "\u201cThe strong implication there is that he talked her into making those statements, perhaps gave her money. We don't know. But that would be witness tampering,\" Ms Bloom told Newsnight.",
      "Prosecutors have stated their investigation is ongoing, leaving open the possibility of additional charges or defendants.",
      "Ms Bloom said she believes others could be charged in the investigation.",
      "\"He didn't do this by himself,\" Ms Bloom said. \"He had an operation that people were brought in by others, so he didn't do everything himself. And we think it's very important that not only do predators get brought to justice, but those who conspire with them, who help them, who are complicit.\"",
      "Dozens of civil lawsuits also have been filed against Mr Combs accusing him of coercing and abusing both men and women, blackmailing them with video recordings of sexual encounters, threatening witnesses, and in some cases, physically beating them.",
      "Several cases include accusations from people who were underage at the time of the alleged assaults.",
      "Mr Combs has vehemently denied all the allegations.",
      "His legal team previously offered a $50m bail package that included house arrest and no female visitors, but it was rejected by the court.",

      "The sequel to animated Disney musical Moana has been broadly described by film critics as good - but not as good as the 2016 original.",
      "The Telegraph awarded four stars to the follow-up, which it called a \"giddily animated triumph\".",
      "Empire gave the same rating, saying the new film is \"a touch less fresh than the original\", but is \"still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination\".",
      "However, the Guardian awarded two stars to Moana 2, saying \"this frictionless sequel lacks genuine passion\".",
      "The newspaper's critic Peter Bradshaw described it as \"a vacuum-packed slice of digital IP content, a perky ChatGPT iteration of love, laughter and belonging\".",
      "\"It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency,\" he wrote.",
      "The original story of an adventurous Polynesian girl who sets sail on a mission to save her people was a box office hit eight years ago.",

      "'Above average'",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman summed up the film as a \"more dutiful than inspired sequel which turns into a catchy action fairy tale\".",
      "\"Moana doesn't have much inner journey left, but the movie has vibrant monsters and a flow of movement that keeps your eyeballs dancing,\" he wrote.",
      "He noted how the new songs \"lack that Lin-Manuel Miranda magic\" that was present in the orginal on memorable tracks like How Far I\u2019ll Go and You\u2019re Welcome.",
      "\"Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first Moana at its best, transcended,\" he concluded.",
      "\"The new movie wears you down to win you over; it\u2019s a just efficient enough delivery system for follow-your-dreams inspiration to be a major holiday hit.\"",

      "He added: \"Moana 2 exhilarates with its tunefulness, and absolutely romps along from the moment the heroine gets off the island, bound for another adventure on her trusty outrigger canoe.\"",
      "The earworms in the soundtrack \"cluster neatly around entwined themes: spreading your wings versus the tug of homesickness; finding your path but daring also to lose it\", he wrote.",
      "However, the Radio Times said the \"colourful Disney sequel lacks emotional impact\".",
      "\"The follow-up will appeal to the youngest of fans, but parents may find themselves less invested,\" wrote James Mottram, awarding three stars.",

      "\"What once seemed so effortlessly charming about this young wayfinder forging her own path has, in Part Two, become more convoluted and stilted - it\u2019s a journey that, frustratingly, leads nowhere.\"",
      "BBC Culture reviewer Nicholas Barber said the sequel was a \"solid\" effort given that number one was \"a hard act to follow\".",
      "He branded number two as a \"hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride\" that lacks the joy and refreshing originality of its predecessor.",
      "\"It comes across as several episodes glued together, each one more outlandish than the last.\"",
      "A Moana sequel was initially mooted as a Disney+ series, but taking it to cinemas instead has now set up a box office battle with the first Wicked film, which has just been released.",

      "But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York.",
      "A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year.",

    "story": [
      "In Beatles '64, the new documentary which charts the impact of the band's first US tour and how it catapulted them to global superstardom, Paul McCartney makes a suggestion as to why they achieved so much so quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen we came, it was quite shortly after Kennedy had been assassinated,\" he said.",
      "\"Maybe America needed something like The Beatles to be lifted out of sorrow.\"",
      "Beatles scholars and cultural historians have long remarked upon how much of a lift the band gave to an America in mourning.",
      "But was McCartney right? Was the rise of the world's most famous band partly down to the murder of the 35th president of the United States?",
      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",
      "'Unstoppable force'",
      "When The Beatles landed at the recently-renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964, it was just 70 days after the the 46-year-old Democrat had been murdered.",
      "Kennedy was shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 and his death threw his country into a period of mourning.",
      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",
      "He said the president was, like The Beatles, \"young, handsome, witty and energetic, which translated really well to TV\".",
      "\"He embraced television and was well suited to it,\" he said.",
      "\"And that makes the shock and trauma of his death sharper in the aftermath.",
      "\"It was the first killing of a sitting president in 60 years.\"",
      "It was, of course, TV which also helped The Beatles become a phenomenon in their homeland.",
      "Settling on their now final line-up of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1962, the Liverpool four-piece had already scored two number one albums in 1963 with Please Please Me and With The Beatles.",
      "When that success was coupled with the famous 1963 Royal Variety Performance appearance during which Lennon asked \"the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands\" and the rest to just \"rattle their jewellery\" they became a national sensation.",
      "Senior music industries lecturer Dr Holly Tessler, from the University of Liverpool, said it was that show that \"made them stars overnight\".",
      "\"At this point, The Beatles were an unstoppable force in the UK,\" she said.",
      "Fear of failure",
      "The Beatles' youthful exuberance was central to their success, chiming with the legions of British teenagers that had begun to follow them.",
      "Dr Andelic said in America, JFK had a similar appeal.",
      "\"Kennedy projected youth and vitality and in his inaugural address, he spoke of the torch being passed to a new generation of Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"His death cut that short in a shocking way.\"",
      "He said in the aftermath, the nation started \"to look for more positive things, stability and reassurance\".",
      "\"When The Beatles arrive, I think they represented that.",
      "\"They were also young, vital, and [in the footage] of them getting off the plane, they were being silly.",
      "\"So, for a nation shattered by a trauma, The Beatles represented an opportunity to laugh and have fun again.\"",
      "Winning over a portion of America's youth was one thing, but cracking the national market was another.",
      "Many British acts had tried and failed to mirror the transatlantic appeal of their US counterparts, who had seen great chart success in the UK, and crack the American market.",
      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",
      "\"My view is the people screaming for The Beatles at the airport were young and didn't know much about politics,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the turning point was the Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "'Fleeting at best'",
      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",
      "About a month after those first three performances, The Beatles made US chart history by becoming the first act to hold the top five slots simultaneously.",
      "Beatlemania had now gone global and the rest was history.",
      "For Dr Tessler, the notion that America went down with the death of JFK and back up with the arrival of The Beatles is too simplistic.",
      "For her too, it was the Ed Sullivan Show appearances, rather than the assassination aftermath that set The Beatles on the road to pop immortality.",
      "\"I really struggle with the idea that The Beatles owe their US success to JFK being shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Their manager Brian Epstein had already been to America and done the deal to get them on the Sullivan show weeks before Kennedy was killed, and there was so much hype when the band finally landed in the US.",
      "\"America might have wanted a distraction from that feeling of 'what's next' after the assassination, but The Beatles became the story so quickly that the connection to Kennedy was only fleeting at best.\"",

      "\"She has been around for such a long time and she used to go out - I would be at raves that she was at when she was like 15,\" says Moxie.",
      "\"She is opening up the conversation about the sorts of places that have inspired her.\"",
      "And as those places start to disappear, Moxi's hopeful that Charli's fanbase will discover a love of club music that has been on the wane.",

      "For people under 34, two thirds of them have said that's meant they've reduced the number they go to.",
      "Tasha and Lucas also spent \u00a340 on their tickets and are hoping Charli XCX will give a boost to the clubbing scene.",

      "\"I think that's what Charli is doing here and I think that's something that's been missing,\" Shaad says.",
      "\"We lose something when pop references itself.\"",
      "As for what the Brat tour can do for the clubbing scene, Shaad believes that, while there's a growing market for big ticket events like festivals and the Eras tour, huge gigs can happily co-exist with a smaller club scene.",

    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",

      "\"A second later, I heard the crowd cheer, and it lifted me up off the ground.",
      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",

      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",

    "summary": "Forty years on, the Band Aid song continues to generate debate about the way it presents Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",
      "\"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity,\" he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.",
      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than \u00a33m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.",
      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",
      "He was influenced by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who himself had refused to take part a decade ago.",
      "\"The world has changed but Band Aid hasn\u2019t,\" he told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa podcast this week.",
      "\"It\u2019s saying there\u2019s no peace and joy in Africa this Christmas. It\u2019s still saying there\u2019s death in every tear,\" he said referring to the lyrics of the 2014 version.",
      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",
      "Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but \"Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it\".",
      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",
      "The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.",
      "For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.",
      "That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.",
      "For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.",
      "The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.",
      "\"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency,\" Lena Bheeroo, Bond\u2019s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement.",
      "Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on \"colonial tropes\".",
      "The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.",
      "While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.",
      "\"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that\u2019s a big, big change,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering\u2026 the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception.\"",
      "The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.",
      "A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.",
      "For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.",
      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

      "Speaking to the BBC, Dr Sarah Cox, president of the APM, which is against assisted dying, said: \u201cHealth Secretary Wes Streeting said part of the reason he could not vote for assisted dying was because palliative care was not good enough.",

      "Labour's Dianne Abbott told the BBC that what \"people really need is access to hospice care\".",
      "She voted against the bill, and told Today: \"I am very worried that vulnerable people will get swept up in the assisted dying route when actually what they really need is access to hospice care and proper end of life care.\"",

      "\"I think they should have a genuine choice and not see supported suicide as the only option\" said Ms Abbot.",

      "He added that the bill was \"a enormous and fundamental change in the UK\" from what this \"wonderful group of doctors believes in and has practiced up until now\", however, \"society has spoken through the MPs\" and the issues had been \"extensively debated\".",

      "Hospices, which provide care for around 300,000 people a year, are struggling for money. Around a third of their funding comes from the NHS, with the sector having to raise the rest themselves. A parliamentary report has described this funding system as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d.",

      "More coordination between hospitals, community NHS teams, care homes and hospices is needed, and training for non-palliative care specialists is also an issue, she said.",

      "The US",
      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",
      "Loss of dignity - 234 patients (63.8%)Losing control of bodily functions - 171 (46.6%)Concern about being a burden on family and friends - 159 (43.3%)Inadequate pain control - 126 (34.3%)Financial implications of treatment - 30 (8.2%)",

      "Inadequate pain control - 126 (34.3%)",
      "Financial implications of treatment - 30 (8.2%)",
      "In Oregon, as in other US states that permit assisted dying, the lethal medication must be self-administered - the same is proposed in England and Wales. Around one in three of those prescribed a lethal dose don\u2019t go ahead with it.",
      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",
      "\u201cBut I think there's rightful concern based on other issues and how his approach to those issues might play in here.\u201d",

      "Yet the number of approvals has risen by just 17% over the same period, while refusals almost doubled from 27,100 to 53,100.",

      "Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said the \"shocking\" statistics showed the previous government had increased levels of migration \u201cby design, not accident\u201d.",
      "He promised changes to the rules on work visas and skills training to reduce the dependence on foreign workers in some parts of economy.",

      "Dr Ben Brindle, a researcher for the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \"We are yet to see the full impact of the visa restrictions in the data, although this initial data from the summer suggest that migration levels will not necessarily fall below pre-Brexit levels once the policy changes have bedded in.\"",

      "On a three-day visit to the country, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also signed a new agreement to ensure failed Iraqi asylum seekers are returned home more \"swiftly\".",
      "She met ministers from the federal government in Baghdad and regional leaders in Kurdistan in the north where many smuggling gangs are based.",
      "The agreement will involve greater intelligence sharing and more joint law enforcement operations, all designed to increase the number of smugglers that are prosecuted.",
      "As part of the deal, the UK will give Iraqi law enforcement \u00a3300,000 for training in border security, focused on organised immigration crime and drug trafficking. On top of this, the authorities in the Kurdistan region of Iraq will get support worth \u00a3200,000 to help tighten their border security and tackle irregular migration.",
      "The home secretary was accompanied by Martin Hewitt, the government's new Border Security Commander, who met his Iraqi counterpart. Both men will play a huge role in trying to make the agreement work.",
      "The BBC team were the only broadcast journalists travelling with Cooper. The focus in Baghdad was a half-day meeting with her Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Amir al-Shammari.",
      "They met at the interior ministry before visiting the Iraqi human trafficking centre.",
      "The home secretary also toured a police college where she was guest of honour for a marching parade of more than 2,000 newly trained Iraqi officers.",
      "The agreement is the first substantive attempt by the government to fulfil the prime minister\u2019s \"personal mission\" to combat people smuggling at source rather than just trying to stop boats in the Channel.",
      "Iraqi migrants are regularly among the top five nationalities seeking to cross to the UK and many of the smuggling networks across Europe are run by Iraqi Kurds.",
      "We spoke to Shukria Badar, a mother of five boys and two girls from Erbil, whose son Baryar Mohamed used people smugglers to try to reach Britain. He perished in the Channel when his overloaded boat sank in heavy seas. He was 23-years-old.",

      "The new UK-Iraqi deal is designed to be a blueprint for further cooperation between both governments.",

      "But the home secretary refused to say how many Iraqis would be returned and how quickly.",
      "She said: \u201cWe think this partnership is really important because it includes training, capability building, information sharing in order to go after these criminal gangs who are profiting from undermining border security, profiting from putting lives at risk.",

      "There is a risk that smuggling networks are replaced the moment some ringleaders are arrested.",
      "There may be difficulties getting different parts of Iraq\u2019s law enforcement agencies to cooperate with one another.",
      "Communications campaigns to deter migration often struggle to counter the reports of friends and family in the UK.",
      "We spoke to one people smuggler in Erbil who wished to remain anonymous. He told us the new agreement might make him more cautious for a while but it would not stop him doing business.",
      "The man \u2013 who was 36-years-old and from northern Iraq \u2013 said he had helped more than 5,000 people leave Kurdistan. He said he was responsible for organising the whole journey to the UK. But he refused to take responsibility for migrants dying in the Channel, blaming local smugglers for overloading boats and migrants themselves for taking the risk.",
      "\"We often pay for the boat that carries small numbers, because we bear responsibility for it. The parents are also informed that the road is illegal,\" he said.",
      "\"In the event of deaths or harm, we do not bear responsibility. The majority of these incidents occur because Pakistani and Afghan smugglers load large numbers onto boats.",
      "\"The majority of drowning accidents are for those who pay less amount of money. A boat that carries a few people has a higher price than a boat that carries a large number of people. For example, for a boat that is heavily loaded, we pay 1,200 euros but for a boat that carries a smaller number, we pay 2,500 euros.\"",

      "She said Reform UK were \"patriotic bravehearts\" who would \"deliver the fresh start this country so desperately needs\".",
      "Dame Andrea had represented Morley and Outwood for the Conservatives between 2015 and 2024 but lost the new seat of Leeds South West and Morley in the general election earlier this year.",
      "Her decision to leave the Tories came as the Reform UK's leader Nigel Farage said his party's membership had exceeded 100,000.",

      "In Love is Enough, Sir Ed perhaps wisely leaves the bulk of the singing to the members of the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir.",
      "He joins in at the bridge around three quarters of the way through the song and during the chorus - but there is no big show-stopping solo.",
      "During the general election Sir Ed's main rivals included Rishi Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage.",

      "These days the Official Charts Company uses a formula to combine CD and vinyl sales with downloads, streams and YouTube views, giving greater weight to actual sales (physical or downloaded).",
      "As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required.",
      "But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York.",
      "A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year.",
      "Wham! racked up 13.3 million streams a year ago to clinch that accolade \u2013 so if over the next few weeks we notice Sir Ed and his fellow Lib Dems frantically tapping at their phones, we will know the reason why."

    "summary": "MPs have backed a change in the law, but the measure still faces many hurdles before coming into force.",
    "story": [
      "MPs' vote to back the legalisation of assisted dying in England and Wales is historic.",
      "It means such a law has moved a step closer to being passed - but it is only one step along a path likely to last many months. Even then, the legislation could take two years to come into force.",
      "There are still many parliamentary hurdles the Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill must clear before it becomes law, with five stages handled by MPs and five more by peers, and further rounds of voting.",
      "If it successfully navigates this process, we could see the law change to allow some terminally-ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP behind the bill, told the Commons there would a period of up to two years before any new law was implemented because \"it is more important to get this right than to do it quickly\".",
      "But it is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all.",

      "Chris Mason: A momentous day in Parliament, whatever happens next",
      "The measure was introduced by Labour MP Leadbeater as a private members' bill (PMB), which is a way for backbenchers to bring forward new laws in addition to the government's agenda.",
      "It was also brought forward as a conscience issue, meaning MPs are free to vote according to their beliefs rather than in line with their party.",
      "A bill's first reading is a formality, where Leadbeater read out its name in the Commons and a date was set for the next stage.",
      "The real debate between MPs got under way during its second reading on Friday.",
      "At the end of the debate, Leadbeater's bill was backed in principle by 330 votes to 275.",
      "It will now move on to be scrutinised at committee stage, where it will be scrutinised line by line by a smaller group of MPs.",
      "Report stage then follows, allowing any MPs to propose amendments. The Commons Speaker will decide which ones are debated and voted on.",
      "After this, MPs get a a final chance to vote for or against the bill at what is known as third reading - and some may change their mind about it - after which all five stages must be repeated by peers in the House of Lords.",

      "There will also have to be a money resolution to authorise any spending the bill would require. Only the government can table money resolutions.",
      "The government might decide to intervene in the parliamentary process to change some of the normal procedures that apply to PMBs from now on - for example to allow more Commons time at report stage.",
      "But so far it has not indicated it is planning to do this.",
      "A PMB's committee would not normally have the power to call in experts to give evidence, but MPs approved a motion straight after Friday's main vote to allow it to do so.",
      "PMBs do not have timetabled committee sessions, potentially giving extra time to examine the legislation.",
      "The prime minister, who voted for the bill, has said a government impact assessment will be carried out and published as the bill proceeds.",
      "Another issue is that the ministers who heads the two main departments that would have to implement the legislation - Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood - were among the MPs who opposed the bill on Friday.",
      "All bills must complete their parliamentary stages by the end of the year's parliamentary session. These are not set in stone.",
      "Report stage onwards needs to take place during the Friday sessions set aside for PMBs, and can run only from 25 April.",
      "In practical terms, that means the committee stage needs to be completed quite  quickly to leave sufficient time for the remaining stages of the bill to take place.",
      "A particular risk to the bill's passage could be at report stage where, if many  amendments are tabled, Parliament could run out of time to debate them all.",
      "Throughout the parliamentary process, lobbying from both sides will continue to shore up support and change MPs' minds, in time for the final vote."

      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",
      "Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria have all introduced assisted dying laws since 2015 \u2013 when UK MPs last voted on the issue \u2013 some allowing assisted death for those who are not terminally ill.",
      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "The US",
      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",
      "Loss of dignity - 234 patients (63.8%)Losing control of bodily functions - 171 (46.6%)Concern about being a burden on family and friends - 159 (43.3%)Inadequate pain control - 126 (34.3%)Financial implications of treatment - 30 (8.2%)",

      "Financial implications of treatment - 30 (8.2%)",
      "In Oregon, as in other US states that permit assisted dying, the lethal medication must be self-administered - the same is proposed in England and Wales. Around one in three of those prescribed a lethal dose don\u2019t go ahead with it.",
      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

    "title": "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:12:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Governments don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay more, argues an expert.",
    "story": [
      "It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life - and the pilot has announced that there\u2019s no need to worry about the environmental impact.",
      "This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact. The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government\u2019s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.",
      "This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees.",
      "Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions. For UK emissions alone you\u2019d need a forest almost the size of Wales.",
      "So, just how realistic is the plan to hit Jet Zero by 2050? And what is the knock-on cost for passengers?",
      "Earlier this year, Anthony Browne, who was the aviation minister in the Conservative government at the time, said that he thought any increase in ticket prices would be \u201cmarginal\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe don't think the difference will be noticeable to most consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "But some experts claim that politicians are not being realistic. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that there \u201cdefinitely would be higher cost\u201d.",
      "\u201cGovernments desperately don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay for what they do.\u201d",
      "But ultimately, the cost depends on which methods are employed to cut or reduce emissions.",
      "From sharklets to UltraFans",
      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",

      "How service charges in flats spiralled out of control",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",

      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "But the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.",
      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",
      "That will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.",
      "\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign...  means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century\u2019s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

    "title": "Could a thermal camera reveal your home's hidden heat loss?",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

    "story": [
      "A charred lorry, empty tear gas shells and posters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan - it was all that remained of a massive protest led by Khan\u2019s wife, Bushra Bibi, that had sent the entire capital into lockdown.",
      "Just a day earlier, faith healer Bibi - wrapped in a white shawl, her face covered by a white veil - stood atop a shipping container on the edge of the city as thousands of her husband\u2019s devoted followers waved flags and chanted slogans beneath her.",
      "It was the latest protest to flare since Khan, the 59-year-old cricketing icon-turned-politician, was jailed more than a year ago after falling foul of the country's influential military which helped catapult him to power.",
      "\u201cMy children and my brothers! You have to stand with me,\u201d Bibi cried on Tuesday afternoon, her voice cutting through the deafening roar of the crowd.",
      "\u201cBut even if you don\u2019t,\u201d she continued, \u201cI will still stand firm.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about my husband. It is about this country and its leader.\u201d",
      "It was, noted some watchers of Pakistani politics, her political debut.",
      "But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there was no sign of Bibi, nor the thousands of protesters who had marched through the country to the heart of the capital, demanding the release of their jailed leader.",
      "While other PMs have fallen out with Pakistan's military in the past, Khan's refusal to stay quiet behind bars is presenting an extraordinary challenge - escalating the standoff and leaving the country deeply divided.",
      "Exactly what happened to the so-called \u201cfinal march\u201d, and Bibi, when the city went dark is still unclear.",
      "All eyewitnesses like Samia* can say for certain is that the lights went out suddenly, plunging D Chowk, the square where they had gathered, into blackness.",
      "As loud screams and clouds of tear gas blanketed the square, Samia describes holding her husband on the pavement, bloodied from a gun shot to his shoulder.",
      "\"Everyone was running for their lives,\" she later told BBC Urdu from a hospital in Islamabad, adding it was \"like doomsday or a war\".",
      "\"His blood was on my hands and the screams were unending.\u201d",
      "But how did the tide turn so suddenly and decisively?",
      "Just hours earlier, protesters finally reached D Chowk late afternoon on Tuesday. They had overcome days of tear gas shelling and a maze of barricaded roads to get to the city centre.",
      "Many of them were supporters and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party led by Khan.",
      "He had called for the march from his jail cell, where he has been for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated.",
      "Now Bibi - his third wife, a woman who had been largely shrouded in mystery and out of public view since their unexpected wedding in 2018 - was leading the charge.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t go back until we have Khan with us,\u201d she declared as the march reached D Chowk, deep in the heart of Islamabad\u2019s government district.",
      "Insiders say even the choice of destination - a place where her husband had once led a successful sit in - was Bibi\u2019s, made in the face of other party leader\u2019s opposition, and appeals from the government to choose another gathering point.",
      "Her being at the forefront may have come as a surprise. Bibi, only recently released from prison herself, is often described as private and apolitical. Little is known about her early life, apart from the fact she was a spiritual guide long before she met Khan. Her teachings, rooted in Sufi traditions, attracted many followers - including Khan himself.",
      "Was she making her move into politics - or was her sudden appearance in the thick of it a tactical move to keep Imran Khan\u2019s party afloat while he remains behind bars?",
      "For critics, it was a move that clashed with Imran Khan\u2019s oft-stated opposition to dynastic politics.",
      "There wasn\u2019t long to mull the possibilities.",
      "After the lights went out, witnesses say that police started firing fresh rounds of tear gas at around 21:30 local time (16:30 GMT).",
      "The crackdown was in full swing just over an hour later.",
      "At some point, amid the chaos, Bushra Bibi left.",
      "Videos on social media appeared to show her switching cars and leaving the scene. The BBC couldn\u2019t verify the footage.",
      "By the time the dust settled, her container had already been set on fire by unknown individuals.",
      "By 01:00 authorities said all the protesters had fled.",
      "Eyewitnesses have described scenes of chaos, with tear gas fired and police rounding up protesters.",
      "One, Amin Khan, said from behind an oxygen mask that he joined the march knowing that, \"either I will bring back Imran Khan or I will be shot\".",
      "The authorities have have denied firing at the protesters. They also said some of the protesters were carrying firearms.",
      "The BBC has seen hospital records recording patients with gunshot injuries.",
      "However, government spokesperson Attaullah Tarar told the BBC that hospitals had denied receiving or treating gunshot wound victims.",
      "He added that \"all security personnel deployed on the ground have been forbidden\" from having live ammunition during protests.",
      "But one doctor told BBC Urdu that he had never done so many surgeries for gunshot wounds in a single night.",
      "\"Some of the injured came in such critical condition that we had to start surgery right away instead of waiting for anaesthesia,\" he said.",
      "While there has been no official toll released, the BBC has confirmed with local hospitals that at least five people have died.",
      "Police say at least 500 protesters were arrested that night and are being held in police stations. The PTI claims some people are missing.",
      "And one person in particular hasn\u2019t been seen in days: Bushra Bibi.",
      "\u201cShe abandoned us,\u201d said one PTI supporter.",
      "Others defended her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her fault,\u201d insisted another. \u201cShe was forced to leave by the party leaders.\u201d",

      "\u201cHer exit damaged her political career before it even started,\u201d said Mehmal Sarfraz, a journalist and analyst.",
      "But was that even what she wanted?",
      "Khan has previously dismissed any thought his wife might have her own political ambitions - \u201cshe only conveys my messages,\u201d he said in a statement attributed to him on his X account.",
      "Speaking to BBC Urdu, analyst Imtiaz Gul calls her participation \u201can extraordinary step in extraordinary circumstances\".",
      "Gul believes Bushra Bibi\u2019s role today is only about \u201ckeeping the party and its workers active during Imran Khan\u2019s absence\u201d.",
      "It is a feeling echoed by some PTI members, who believe she is \u201cstepping in only because Khan trusts her deeply\u201d.",
      "Insiders, though, had often whispered that she was pulling the strings behind the scenes - advising her husband on political appointments and guiding high-stakes decisions during his tenure.",
      "A more direct intervention came for the first time earlier this month, when she urged a meeting of PTI leaders to back Khan\u2019s call for a rally.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s defence minister Khawaja Asif accused her of \u201copportunism\u201d, claiming she sees \u201ca future for herself as a political leader\u201d.",
      "But Asma Faiz, an associate professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences, suspects the PTI\u2019s leadership may have simply underestimated Bibi.",
      "\u201cIt was assumed that there was an understanding that she is a non-political person, hence she will not be a threat,\u201d she told the AFP news agency.",
      "\u201cHowever, the events of the last few days have shown a different side of Bushra Bibi.\u201d",
      "But it probably doesn\u2019t matter what analysts and politicians think. Many PTI supporters still see her as their connection to Imran Khan. It was clear her presence was enough to electrify the base.",

    "story": [
      "A Canadian territory has changed its rules for elected municipal officials, allowing them to take an oath pledging allegiance to the country's constitution instead of  the British Crown when they are sworn in.",
      "The change comes after the newly-elected council of Dawson City, Yukon, refused to take the King's oath in solidarity with an indigenous council member who raised concerns about the Crown\u2019s history in Canada.",
      "The protest delayed their confirmation and placed the town's governance at a standstill.",
      "On Friday, the territory announced that they have adjusted the law to give the option of taking one of the two oaths.",
      "Richard Mostyn, Yukon\u2019s minister of community services, said the change \u201callows elected municipal officials to take the Oath of Allegiance in a way that aligns with society\u2019s broader values and cultural identities\u201d.",
      "In Canada - a Commonwealth country and former British colony - most elected officials have to take an oath in which they swear or affirm they \"will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles III\" and his \"heirs and successors according to law\".",
      "Questions had swirled about whether Dawson City's new council, which was elected in late October, would be able to sit if they refused to take the oath.",
      "Under Yukon law, a newly- elected official must take it within 40 days of their election or else their win \u201cshall be considered null\u201d.",
      "This gave officials a 9 December deadline to come up with a solution.",
      "Councillor Darwyn Lynn, a member of the Tr\u2019ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch\u2019in First Nation, said he was hesitant to take the oath because of Canada\u2019s fraught history with indigenous peoples.",
      "\u201cI read it probably about 15 times, and it didn\u2019t get any easier to do,\u201d said Lynn at the press conference announcing the change.",
      "\u201cWith the history that the Crown has had in Canada and other places, I thought that there may be another option.\u201d",
      "By questioning the requirement, a \u201cwonderful conversation\u201d on Canada\u2019s history was sparked in Dawson City, a town of 2,400 people, as well as in the broader Yukon territory, he said.",
      "That conversation was \u201cvery balanced\u201d, he said, with some people supporting an alternative and others hesitant over its removal.",
      "\u201cEverybody has the right to have their opinion and option, and that is the great part of our country,\u201d said Lynn.",
      "He and the other Dawson City councillors will take the oath of their choice in the coming days.",
      "This is not the first time that a Canadian province or territory had amended the requirement of the Oath of Allegiance.",
      "In 2022, the French-speaking province of Quebec passed legislation that ended the requirement to have elected officials take an oath to the monarchy. One lawmaker called it \u201ca relic from the past\u201d.",
      "The oath, however, remains a requirement for members of Canada's national parliament and for most members of provincial legislative assemblies.",

    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:58:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Once restricted to only big cities, high-end specialty coffee chains are finding new customers across India.",
    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",
      "\"It\u2019s about dedication, crafting local flavours, and understanding customers, even if it means working with slim profit margins for the long haul.\""

      "Beatles scholars and cultural historians have long remarked upon how much of a lift the band gave to an America in mourning.",
      "But was McCartney right? Was the rise of the world's most famous band partly down to the murder of the 35th president of the United States?",
      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",
      "'Unstoppable force'",
      "When The Beatles landed at the recently-renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964, it was just 70 days after the the 46-year-old Democrat had been murdered.",
      "Kennedy was shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 and his death threw his country into a period of mourning.",
      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",
      "He said the president was, like The Beatles, \"young, handsome, witty and energetic, which translated really well to TV\".",
      "\"He embraced television and was well suited to it,\" he said.",
      "\"And that makes the shock and trauma of his death sharper in the aftermath.",
      "\"It was the first killing of a sitting president in 60 years.\"",
      "It was, of course, TV which also helped The Beatles become a phenomenon in their homeland.",
      "Settling on their now final line-up of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1962, the Liverpool four-piece had already scored two number one albums in 1963 with Please Please Me and With The Beatles.",
      "When that success was coupled with the famous 1963 Royal Variety Performance appearance during which Lennon asked \"the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands\" and the rest to just \"rattle their jewellery\" they became a national sensation.",
      "Senior music industries lecturer Dr Holly Tessler, from the University of Liverpool, said it was that show that \"made them stars overnight\".",
      "\"At this point, The Beatles were an unstoppable force in the UK,\" she said.",
      "Fear of failure",
      "The Beatles' youthful exuberance was central to their success, chiming with the legions of British teenagers that had begun to follow them.",
      "Dr Andelic said in America, JFK had a similar appeal.",
      "\"Kennedy projected youth and vitality and in his inaugural address, he spoke of the torch being passed to a new generation of Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"His death cut that short in a shocking way.\"",
      "He said in the aftermath, the nation started \"to look for more positive things, stability and reassurance\".",
      "\"When The Beatles arrive, I think they represented that.",
      "\"They were also young, vital, and [in the footage] of them getting off the plane, they were being silly.",
      "\"So, for a nation shattered by a trauma, The Beatles represented an opportunity to laugh and have fun again.\"",
      "Winning over a portion of America's youth was one thing, but cracking the national market was another.",
      "Many British acts had tried and failed to mirror the transatlantic appeal of their US counterparts, who had seen great chart success in the UK, and crack the American market.",
      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",
      "\"My view is the people screaming for The Beatles at the airport were young and didn't know much about politics,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the turning point was the Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "'Fleeting at best'",
      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",
      "About a month after those first three performances, The Beatles made US chart history by becoming the first act to hold the top five slots simultaneously.",
      "Beatlemania had now gone global and the rest was history.",
      "For Dr Tessler, the notion that America went down with the death of JFK and back up with the arrival of The Beatles is too simplistic.",
      "For her too, it was the Ed Sullivan Show appearances, rather than the assassination aftermath that set The Beatles on the road to pop immortality.",
      "\"I really struggle with the idea that The Beatles owe their US success to JFK being shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Their manager Brian Epstein had already been to America and done the deal to get them on the Sullivan show weeks before Kennedy was killed, and there was so much hype when the band finally landed in the US.",
      "\"America might have wanted a distraction from that feeling of 'what's next' after the assassination, but The Beatles became the story so quickly that the connection to Kennedy was only fleeting at best.\"",

      "This quiet spell was, on the face of it, something of a surprise.",
      "Hurricanes are fuelled by warm oceans, and sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic were consistently above average.",
      "The end of El Nino, which can put the brakes on hurricane development, was also expected to mean storms would form readily.",
      "But the formation of hurricanes is a complex recipe requiring many ingredients.",
      "It is thought that a shift in weather patterns in Africa - which brought rare rain to the Sahara - meant the clusters of thunderstorms that give birth to tropical systems emerged into the Atlantic further north than usual in an area less ripe for development. Large amounts of Saharan dust may also have suppressed activity.",
      "But sea surface temperatures remained high - meaning the potential for powerful hurricanes remained.",
      "Helene brought devastation as far north as Asheville, North Carolina",
      "The Atlantic roars back to life",
      "This potential was realised in late September with the birth of Hurricane Helene. It intensified rapidly before making landfall on the Florida coast as a major category four storm.",
      "Helene brought catastrophic flooding and widespread wind damage across large swathes of the south-east US, from Florida's Gulf Coast to the southern Appalachians.",
      "According to preliminary data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) it was the deadliest hurricane to affect the continental US since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, causing more than 150 deaths.",
      "Helene was the first of six storms to develop in quick succession. Five of these became hurricanes of which four underwent rapid intensification, where sustained winds strengthen by at least 35mph (56km/h) in 24 hours.",
      "This culminated with Hurricane Milton, which formed in the Gulf of Mexico in early October and saw its wind speeds increase by a massive 90mph (145km/h) in 24 hours - one of the most extreme examples of rapid intensification on record.",
      "It reached category five strength for a time, before weakening to a category three and making landfall on the west coast of Florida. It brought widespread impacts including a destructive storm surge and an outbreak of 46 tornadoes.",
      "The final storm of the Atlantic season was Tropical Storm Sara. This storm did not strengthen into a hurricane - but it became slow-moving close to the coast of Central America, bringing widespread flooding. The north coast of Honduras saw more than 3ft (nearly 1m) of rain.",
      "Destructive winds were just one impact from Hurricane Milton in Florida",
      "Is climate change to blame?",
      "High sea temperatures are a key driver of tropical storms and hurricanes - these have been around 1C above the 1991-2020 average, according to BBC analysis of data from the European climate service.",
      "This fits a pattern of warm oceans around the globe, fuelled by climate change.",
      "Analysis by Climate Central, external has found that maximum wind speeds in every Atlantic hurricane in 2024 were higher because of climate change. In the case of Hurricane Milton, the winds were 23mph stronger as a result of human-induced global warming.",
      "The very high sea temperatures that fuelled the storm were made 400 to 800 times more likely by climate change",
      "Meanwhile a study by World Weather Attribution , externalshows that climate change increased rainfall from Milton by 20-30%.",

    "story": [
      "A young Palestinian couple in Jerusalem have produced a range of perfumes to embody the heritage of their people. Despite the horror of the war in Gaza, they hope their scents can still summon memories of a better time, as Sebastian Usher reports from Jerusalem.",
      "Out in the fields of the Jordan valley, Palestinian women still sing old folk songs as they harvest the olive groves. One tells the story of how a fabled ship carrying a life-saving cargo of food heads to port during a terrible famine that swept the Levant in the dying days of Ottoman rule. While in the Old City of Jerusalem, the scents of leather, spices and livestock fuse into a fragrance that evokes thousands of years of history.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to send a message to people through our perfumes, revealing our heritage and the scent of our land,\u201d Qassem Abu Khalaf says as he explains the motivation behind the Mejana fragrance line that he\u2019s set up with his wife, Malak Hijazi.",
      "The young couple are Palestinians from the Beit Hanina district in occupied East Jerusalem. He is an advanced materials engineer and she is an English and special needs teacher. Their fragrance line grew from a passion Qassem developed over the years for producing the best quality perfumes. He worked at night on his ideas, building up a library of hundreds of ingredients.",
      "In a restaurant in East Jerusalem amid the ongoing war in Gaza, he says the five scents he\u2019s so far produced are intended to let people hold a piece of Palestinian history in their hands. While for Palestinians themselves, he hopes that it\u2019s a way to reconnect with their roots in a Proustian rush of memory triggered by an aroma.",
      "He and Malak chose the name Mejana, as it\u2019s a word that describes the old songs that Palestinians sing as they are working.",
      "\u201cMejana has a special rhythm when you sing it,\u201d Malak says. \u201cIt means joy and happiness. We chose it, because when you smell a special fragrance, you feel good, you feel happy in the same sort of way.\u201d",
      "Palestinian folk memory also influenced the naming of their first two scents. Zaref Atool is a dark, heavy fragrance - very much what people expect from an oriental style. Qassem says it\u2019s intended to conjure up the feel of the ancient, labyrinthine alleyways of the Old City of Jerusalem. It\u2019s named after the main character in a popular old song - in which the singer laments that a tall, handsome young man is leaving his Palestinian homeland to travel far away.",
      "The other fragrance is called Rozana, after a ship that was feverishly anticipated by people starving across Palestine, Lebanon and Syria after failed wheat harvests 100 years ago. It was meant to deliver salvation, but only brought further bitter disappointment and loss - as its cargo contained almost nothing to eat. Again, there\u2019s a famous song inspired by the story that\u2019s been sung by many of the great Arab singers, such as Fairouz and Sabah.",
      "\u201cI love our identity, our heritage, our folklore and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d says Malak.",
      "If the past is their inspiration, then the present has complicated their efforts to create and launch a brand that celebrates Palestinian identity.",
      "\u201cWe launched our brand on 27 September last year,\u201d Malak says. \u201cWe went to two bazaars in Jerusalem but then the war began and put a stop to everything for many months.\u201d",
      "The souks and shops in the Old City and elsewhere in Israel and the occupied West Bank are denuded of tourists, as shopkeepers try to survive on the still bustling local market.",
      "Qassem and Malak have had some success selling their fragrances to the Palestinian diaspora - in Australia in particular. And they have continued undeterred, producing a second range of three perfumes, beautifully presented in a box painted by a Palestinian artist with local flowers and wildlife.",
      "The perfumes themselves are contained in wooden capsules with a key embossed on one side, which opens up the gold dispenser when turned. A large old key is a symbol of all the Palestinian homes lost when hundreds of thousands were expelled or fled during the war in 1948 that established the State of Israel.",
      "\u201cWhen we chose the key, it was about our memories,\" Malak say. \"It\u2019s designed a little bit differently from the traditional Palestinian key, but it is related to it. When you smell a particular scent, it brings back beautiful memories. So, it is the key to our ancestors and our childhood memories.\u201d",
      "The couple have not only just produced their new range of perfumes - with combinations such as tuberose and berry, and coconut and agarwood - but also their first child - a daughter, Sadeel.",
      "Qassem and Malak say it is a difficult time to bring new life into a world in such conflict. Malak says she feels guilty about it but she had to stop watching news about Gaza during her pregnancy as it was causing her so much stress - and she feared it might negatively affect her baby.",
      "\"It\u2019s not easy,\" Qassem says. \u201cBut we hope everything will come to an end and we\u2019ll have peace. A little peace of mind, too.\u201d"

      "Their exhibition Hakuna Utopia features the works of seven artists exploring themes of apocalypse and resilience \u2013 some in quite abstract ways - as they respond to the daily challenges endured by Nairobi\u2019s six million residents.",
      "One of the collective, Stoneface Bombaa, grew up in Mathare, the capital\u2019s second-largest informal settlement.",
      "He has overcome great odds to become an artist and wants to use his work to address the way that people in Mathare live \u2013 often lacking jobs, housing and education.",
      "Bombaa says they endure a \u201chand-to-mouth economy\u201d, never sure where their next meal will come from.",
      "\u201cPeople are really angry,\u201d he says, but through art, he feels he can \u201cchannel\u201d his community\u2019s anger into something positive as \u201cart unites\u201d.",
      "Bombaa set out to create from the exhibitions \u201cmicro-utopia\u201d sites dotted around the city.",
      "He called it the \u201cjungle room\u201d and hoped to get people to connect with nature from within Mathare itself, in an attempt to bridge the ecological divide.",
      "Ironically, the building he had identified as a possible site was demolished by the authorities to make way for a road.",
      "Undeterred, he has been taking children from his community, often stuck living in unimaginable urban squalor, to experience Nairobi\u2019s verdant parks and expose them to green spaces.",
      "\u201cThere are no trees or green spaces in Mathare,\u201d Bombaa says.",
      "But by contemplating the idea of utopia, he believes that he can imagine what it would be like if people in his community actually had unrestricted access to the city\u2019s green spaces.",
      "In this way, people in his community can claim a right to access nature that is denied to them simply because they are poor.",
      "Bombaa also complains about how ordinary Nairobians, often scrabbling to make a living, have to pay to enter some of their city\u2019s most beautiful locations such as the arboretum or Karura forest.",
      "The Kairos Futura team are also drawing inspiration from nature to use their imagination in how to address urgent environmental issues.",
      "For example, Coltrane McDowell has applied this to architecture.",
      "In his work Invisible Cities, he was inspired by termite mounds to reimagine what architecture might look like in the future.",
      "Another artist in the show, Abdul Rop, known for his mesmerising woodcut prints and paintings, says that in order to \u201cachieve utopia\u201d, Nairobians need to work together.",
      "\u201cThat's why the young people are agitating right now for change,\u201d he says, suggesting they are frustrated by a corrupt political system that hems in their potential.",
      "Gen Z were at the forefront of protests this year against new tax measures, which saw the government make an embarrassing U-turn.",
      "Rop argues that by thinking about utopia through the lens of art, young people may find creative ways to fight for their future.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Paris's Gothic cathedral has been painstakingly returned to its former glory. Here's how it was done.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron has toured Paris's Notre-Dame cathedral live on TV, giving the public a first look inside the building since much of it was destroyed or damaged in a huge fire in 2019.",
      "From the spire to the stained glass, it has been completely transformed. It is not just a renovation after the fire, but a complete overhaul including removing decades of crud and soot built up since the last restoration.",
      "Here we take a look at some of the key features of the repair work and how it was achieved.",
      "The return of the spire",
      "The collapse of the spire was the climax of the 2019 fire. Many people thought it was medieval, but in fact the original was taken down in the 1790s because it was deemed dangerous.",
      "Its replacement, which burned down five years ago, was put up decades later as part of a neo-Gothic reconstruction conducted by architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-Le-Duc.",
      "This time, carpenters used a mix of the traditional and the computerised to design and build the massive wooden base.",
      "It was lifted into place by Europe\u2019s largest crane, then a scaffolding shell was mounted allowing workers to assemble the steadily rising structure.",
      "Like the rest of the roof, the spire is lined with lead. At the top a new gilded cock has been fitted to replace the original that fell in the fire. It was recovered but was too damaged to go back.",
      "Inside the new cock are holy relics including a thorn from the cathedral\u2019s Crown of Thorns, and a parchment with the names of 2,000 people who worked on the renovation.",
      "Luminous limestone",
      "The most striking feature of the renovated cathedral is the luminosity of the stonework. This is because all the limestone blocks have been cleaned, or in some parts replaced.",
      "Replacement stone was sourced in quarries in northern France. Experts were able to detect tiny features in the original stone \u2013 like certain fossils \u2013 that helped them to determine the geographical origin.",
      "The vast majority of the masonry was undamaged, but it was covered not just in age-old accretions of dust and dirt from the past, but also in a layer of soot and lead powder from the fire. It was cleaned with high-power vacuums, and then with a spray which peeled off to remove the dirt.",
      "Overall some 40,000 square metres of stone were cleaned.",
      "To rebuild the vaulted ceiling beneath where the spire had stood, masons had to relearn the principles of Gothic architecture \u2013 using a wooden frame to put the stones in place and crowning it all with the keystone.",
      "More than 1,000 oak trees",
      "It was the wooden roof that burned \u2013 all 100 metres of it. None of the 800-year-old timbers survived. But the decision was quickly made to replace them as faithfully as possible \u2013 with oak from the forests of France.",
      "By happy coincidence an architect called Remi Fromont had conducted an in-depth study of the timber frame as part of his university thesis. This served as a template for carpenters.",
      "Some 1,200 oak trees had to be found, with the stipulation that they be straight, free from knots and a condition called \"frost-crack\", and 13 metres long.",
      "Much of the wood was hand-sawn then hewed into shape with axes, just as the beams were in the 13th century.",
      "Altogether there are 35 \"fermes\" (the triangular structures that take the weight) running the length of the building.",
      "Digitally scanned gargoyles",
      "Many of the exterior sculptures \u2013 including the famous (but not medieval) gargoyles and chimaeras \u2013 were damaged by high-pressure hoses used to fight the fire. Many were already in poor condition because of pollution.",
      "A workshop was set up in front of the cathedral to repair and where necessary replace these statues. Five of the gargoyles (products of Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s imagination) were scanned by computer, and then re-made in limestone.",
      "Inside the cathedral, the most famous sculptures \u2013 such as The Virgin of the Pillar and The Vow of Louis XIII \u2013 emerged unscathed. But they have all been cleaned and given minor repairs.",
      "The cathedral's many paintings have also been cleaned. These include the \"Mays\" \u2013 massive scenes from the life of Christ which were an annual gift to the cathedral in the 17th Century from the goldsmiths of Paris.",
      "The return of colour",
      "One of the most remarkable changes to the cathedral is the return of colour to the choir and many of the side-chapels.",
      "Here again, the fire offered an opportunity to rediscover the glories that lay beneath decades of crud and soot. Blues, reds and golds have re-emerged, combining with the creaminess of the rejuvenated limestone to create a lightness that must be much closer to the original experience.",
      "The same is true of the stained-glass windows. These were undamaged, but filthy. They were dismantled, removed, cleaned, and returned. The big rose-windows were left alone.",
      "Again, much of what the visitor sees today is not actually medieval \u2013 but the product of the medieval imagination of Viollet-le-Duc.",
      "Great organ's 8,000 pipes cleaned",
      "The great organ \u2013 built in the 18th Century \u2013 was unaffected by either heat or water on the night of the fire. What did for it was the accumulation of a yellow dust - lead monoxide - in its pipes.",
      "The whole structure \u2013 12 metres high, six keyboards, 7,952 pipes, 19 wind-chests \u2013 was disassembled and taken to workshops outside Paris.",
      "Sheep-leather linings were replaced and new electronic controls were added. After reinstallation the instrument was re-tuned \u2013 a task which takes several months as each pipe is minutely altered.",
      "On 7 December, the Archbishop of Paris\u2019s first words on entering the reclaimed cathedral will be:  \u201cAwake oh organ, Let God\u2019s praise be heard!\u201d",
      "The eight bells of the north tower were also removed in 2023 \u2013 a massive operation given their size. They were cleaned and treated, and then returned a few weeks ago. The biggest of the bells is called Emmanuel.",
      "New chalices and bronze altar",
      "Visitors will also notice a change to the liturgical lay-out of the cathedral, whose altar, lectern and seating were all destroyed. A simple bronze altar has been created, with new chalices for the sacraments.",
      "There are 1,500 new wooden chairs for the congregation, and a new reliquary behind the choir to hold the Crown of Thorns.",
      "New vestments have also been created for clergy by designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac.",
      "Buried 13th Century structure unveiled",
      "Renovation work at Notre-Dame has been a boon for archaeologists, who have been able to access underground areas that date back to hundreds of years before the cathedral was built.",
      "Among the many sets of bones they discovered are those believed to belong to the Renaissance poet Joachim du Bellay.",
      "Another major discovery was the carefully buried remains of the medieval rood-screen, which originally separated the sacred part of the church from the congregation.",
      "This 11-metre stone partition, built in the 13th Century, contained rich and colourful sculptures depicting the life of Christ. It was dismantled in the 18th Century following a change in church rules.",
      "But clergy clearly hoped the remains would be rediscovered because the parts appear to have been lain with great care beneath the ground. It is hoped they can be pieced together and put on display.",
      "What next?",
      "Despite the success of the renovation, work is not complete. There is still scaffolding around much of the eastern end, and in coming years the outside walls of the apse and sacristy will need treatment.",
      "There are also plans to redesign the esplanade, and to create a museum in the neighbouring H\u00f4tel-Dieu hospital.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 07:32:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Owas Mwape posted on Facebook about his son's drug addiction - and then met up with him for a BBC interview.",
    "story": [
      "One of Zambia's most popular actors and filmmakers Owas Mwape broke a social taboo by admitting that one of his young sons has an addiction to drugs when he posted a recent appeal for advice on Facebook.",
      "The 52-year-old told the BBC he wanted to use his standing as a public figure to open the lid on Zambia\u2019s drug problems and help other parents who fear the stigma of having a child with substance abuse in a socially conservative country.",
      "\"I've discovered most parents hide such kind of things, they're hiding their children,\" said Mwape, the father of five sons and one daughter.",
      "\"It\u2019s out there and on our doorsteps. We can\u2019t run away from it. As long as you send your children to school, know that it could hit your household.\"",
      "The star of award-winning films like Mwansa the Great agreed to sit down to do an in-depth interview with the BBC to discuss the acute pain he feels as a parent and the problem that has clearly shattered his family over the last four to five years.",
      "Mayamiko, now 23, was a teenager when things began to unravel.",
      "First his dad noticed that money was missing from his bank account - Mayamiko had hacked his phone to steal about $3,000 (\u00a32,300) over about two years. Then there was some petty thieving.",
      "Initially it was not clear that he was using the money for drugs, but things came to a head a few minutes before he was due to write final-year school exams - and he ran away from home to live on the streets.",
      "It all clearly stunned and pained Mwape who could not believe the boy he described as sparky and generous could have gone down this path, saying his whole demeanour changes when he's on drugs.",
      "\"It\u2019s a very difficult thing to be a father in the moment that I have found myself in. It\u2019s tough because every child is special and Maya is one of those special kids because he is intelligent,\" he says.",
      "But he says you have to forgive your children to help them, turning to an African proverb to express himself: \"Your child is like an axe, it will hammer you and you pick it up and put it on your shoulder.\"",
      "Mayamiko is now back in touch with his father, but it is always on his terms as he uses different phone numbers, making it difficult to contact him.",
      "But it has given his father hope that things can change - though he realises that for any rehab to work, Mayamiko needs to want to change.",
      "When we met for our interview, Mwape had managed to coax Mayamiko to come along too. It was a frank conversation that at one stage turned into a moving discussion between father and son.",
      "\"Maya, if we found you work to do and you start getting paid, are you going to work extra hard?\" Mwape asked him nearly an hour into our session.",
      "Mayamiko, whose speech was somewhat incoherent and punctuated by long pauses, admitted he would like some help to change his lifestyle and be able to earn money.",
      "His dad followed up with this question: \"Are you promising us that you will stay away from drugs?\"",
      "Mayamiko hesitated and said: \"Yeah.\"",
      "For his father it was a relief to hear that he has aspirations - it is something that he can build on.",
      "But the most frustrating thing for Mwape is that his second-oldest son is never explicit about what drugs he is taking, how he gets hold of them - and often obfuscates when asked a question.",
      "\"When you're trying to speak to him, you can tell that things are not adding up, so that's why for me I really need that sort of... intervention.\"",
      "When probed more during the interview about the drugs, Mayamiko said he mostly took \"cheese\" - a reference to marijuana - or \"anything\".",
      "That is why Mwape, who is currently starring in popular Zambian soap opera Zuba that airs on DStv, took to Facebook, because he wanted to know about rehab centres that have proven examples of success - stories not widely shared in a country where drug addiction is such a hush-hush affair.",
      "There are several private facilities in Zambia - but no publicly funded one - and he says some people have even reportedly sent their children to China.",
      "\"I couldn\u2019t believe [it], there were a number of parents who came into my inbox with similar problems,\" he said.",
      "Mwape\u2019s experience has also influenced the films his company has recently produced - with subject matter considered to be \"un-Zambian\".",
      "\"Girls 2 Ladies is about drugs in boarding schools,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not saying boarding schools are not good, but I think it's important as parents now that we put a keen eye to try to find out what type of schools we're sending our children to, [which is] one of my greatest fears even with what type of rehabilitation centre I should send him [Mayamiko] to.\"",
      "His oldest son, Maxwell, has just directed The Flask, a hard-hitting account of an alcoholic\u2019s downward spiral into addiction that will be released next month.",
      "Researching all these projects has led Mwape to the door of Zambia\u2019s Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) - headed by Nason Banda, whom he praises for his enlightened leadership that favours interventions for youngsters rather than jail - which many parents fear.",
      "\"Sending them to prison doesn\u2019t help because there are still drugs in there,\" Mwape said.",
      "According to Mr Banda, drug abuse in Zambia is worsening, with some of the most abused drugs being cannabis, cocaine, heroin and over-the-counter medicines such as the cough syrup Benylin, which contains codeine.",
      "He told the BBC there had been a 300% increase in the number of people his organisation had attended to over the past 10 years.",
      "\"Now that is just as DEC but we have several other institutions that assist with drug-dependent persons, so that is not the full reflection of the extent of the problem.\"",
      "The head of the country\u2019s anti-drug agency said the main drivers of drug abuse were broken families plus the accessibility and affordability of  drugs.",
      "Peer pressure and the glamourising of drug culture by adults had also contributed, he said.",
      "The DEC was committed to fighting drug abuse by targeting suppliers, consumers and proceeds of the trade, Mr Banda said, adding that he also wanted the government to launch a dedicated rehab centre if the money was available.",
      "For Mwape, he hopes his openness about his son\u2019s problems will not only help his own family but others too - and stop the country living in denial.",
      "And while he admits the pain of a parent never leaves, he feels he will succeed - and that Mayamiko will get clean.",
      "\"Sometimes, battles are never won by simply getting into battle - battles are won by employing strategy and I know that all strategies that I have employed are definitely taking me to the right place.\"",

    "story": [
      "The family of four stood in the middle of the street in front of the pile of twisted metal and broken concrete, struggling to comprehend the devastation they were seeing.",
      "The building had been destroyed by a recent Israeli air strike and smoke was still rising from the rubble. The next building to the right had partially collapsed; the one behind it had a huge hole at the top.",
      "They continued walking to the building where they used to live, in Tyre in southern Lebanon. The displaced family was back, hours after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah had come into effect. Nobody seemed to have stayed in their home.",
      "As there was no electricity they took the stairs to the sixth floor, helped by the torches on their phones.",
      "Mohamad Marouf led his wife and two sons. He struggled to open the main door. When he finally got in, he instantly realised that his home as he knew it was, for now, gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so sad, it\u2019s a nice and decent house,\u201d said Mr Marouf, a car dealer. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much damage.\u201d",
      "Panels had fallen from the ceiling. Windows, doors and furniture were destroyed. In the kitchen, cups and plates lie broken on the floor. There was dust and debris everywhere. Room by room, he mourned objects that were now beyond repair, and celebrated those that somehow had remained intact.",
      "The destruction, Mr Marouf said, had been caused by an attack on a residential building nearby. It was so powerful that his building, too, was heavily damaged.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. They were living with his brother, and did not know when they would be able to move back.",
      "On Tyre\u2019s beachfront, a yellow banner with a Hezbollah logo was put up next to one of many residential buildings hit. It said, \u201cMade in USA\u201d, in reference to the bombs that were probably used in the attack.",
      "As the pause in the fighting held, residents returned to badly damaged homes. All day Wednesday a constant flow of cars arrived, packed with families, bags and mattresses.",
      "Some people waved Hezbollah flags; in the distance, there was the sporadic sound of celebratory gunfire. Many supporters say the ceasefire is a sign of the group\u2019s victory. The \u201cresistance\u201d, as they often refer to Hezbollah, stopped the Israeli military\u2019s advances on the ground, they contend, and Israel failed to achieve its objectives in Lebanon.",
      "It is a narrative that will find very little \u2013 if any \u2013 support elsewhere.",
      "Hezbollah has been weakened, large parts of the country lie in ruins, and many, including those who had accused the group of dragging Lebanon to a conflict that was not in its interests, say the war has only led to death and destruction.",
      "Nearly 4,000 people were killed and more than 16,000 injured, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "What we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal",
      "The conflict began in October 2023 when Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing into Israel in support of Palestinians in Gaza, and escalated dramatically in September, with intense Israeli air strikes, the killings of several top Hezbollah leaders including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, and a ground invasion in the south.",
      "Israel\u2019s stated goal was to remove the group from the border and allow the return of around 60,000 residents who had been displaced.",
      "Israeli bombardments were mostly contained to mainly Shia Muslim areas of the country where Hezbollah was essentially in control. More than one million people were forced to leave their homes.",
      "A 60-day pause is now in force as part of a ceasefire deal, which many hope will bring an end to the conflict. Under its terms Israel and Hezbollah will pull out from the south, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold, and the Lebanese military will deploy an additional 5,000 soldiers to the area.",
      "In the morning, Hezbollah organised a tour for journalists to show the damage around Tyre, a sign that they are still very much present \u2013 and in control \u2013 here.",

      "This partition stretches about 5.6 miles (9km) across Gaza, from east to west, dividing Gaza City and the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia in north Gaza.",
      "The BBC has been told that there is a tactical route between Jabalia and Gaza City, which is part of operational activities targeting Hamas in Jabalia.",
      "Videos filmed by the IDF and posted online show several multi-storey buildings being destroyed in controlled explosions since the beginning of October.",
      "The graphic below shows examples geolocated by BBC Verify along the new corridor.",
      "An IDF spokesperson told the BBC that it had no intention of destroying civilian infrastructure \"without operational necessity\" to neutralise Hamas.",
      "Other footage shows IDF Humvee vehicles being driven through the cleared area from the direction of Israel. Humvees are not as heavily armoured as other military vehicles - and Dr Hellyer told the BBC that they were unlikely to be used unless the military was confident about their safety, indicating that Israeli troops are in control of the area.",
      "Some analysts believe the IDF\u2019s presence could indicate a permanent military partition \u2013 giving it control of who can travel between the Gaza and the North Gaza governorates.",
      "Dr Hellyer said of the IDF: \u201cThey\u2019re digging in for the long term. I would absolutely expect the north partition to develop exactly like the Netzarim Corridor.\u201d",
      "The BBC has previously documented how two partitions have been constructed in Gaza since the start of the current war. The Netzarim Corridor splits an area south of Gaza City, while the Philadelphi Corridor gives the IDF control of land running the length of Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt.",
      "BBC analysis of this new partition in the north shows a similar pattern to the construction of the previous corridors over the past year, with existing and newly built roads being connected and military positions emerging at regular intervals. Buildings and agricultural land are cleared so roads can be paved and military infrastructure built.",
      "Dr Eado Hecht from the Begin\u2013Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (Besa), an Israeli think tank specialising in national security and foreign policy, agreed that the data showed a new dividing line, but questioned whether it was designed to be permanent.",
      "\u201cThere is a new partition corridor separating Gaza City and the northern towns of the Gaza Strip. The goal is to cut off the Hamas - and other organizations' - forces that have returned to that area from support and the ability to retreat, so they can be dealt with more effectively.\u201d",
      "Israel has denied that it is implementing the \"General\u2019s Plan\". Under the strategy, devised by former general Giora EIland, civilians would be told to leave the north, supplies would be blocked and the area would become a military zone. Those who remained would be treated as combatants and faced with the choice of \u201csurrender or starve\", with the aim of putting pressure on Hamas to release its hostages.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, an IDF spokesperson said: \"The IDF operates according to well-established military plans, and the claim that the IDF is implementing this specific plan is incorrect.\"",
      "But concerns have mounted over the safety of the thousands of Palestinian civilians who remain in besieged towns in north Gaza.",
      "The UN and aid charities have raised significant concerns about the situation in the north of Gaza. While thousands of people have been displaced, the UN says over 65,000 people could remain in the area.",
      "The UN also said that \"virtually no aid\" has entered parts of the North Gaza governorate in 40 days on 20 November. A spokesperson on 26 November said that Palestinians were facing \u201cfacing critical shortages of supplies and services, as well as severe overcrowding and poor hygiene conditions\u201d due to the blockade.",
      "Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in the besieged areas of northern Gaza.",
      "BBC analysis shows around 90% of north Gaza has been subject to evacuation orders since the start of October. Videos posted on social media document people being moved south of the new partition. It is not clear if and when they will be able to return, but Israel\u2019s foreign minister has insisted civilians will be allowed to return after the war.",
      "Satellite images show the displacement of people in north Gaza. Large groups of tents, erected as temporary shelter, disappear. In the area left behind, there are often destroyed buildings and other examples of military activity.",
      "While the IDF appears to have established enough control in the area to travel in lightly armoured vehicles, heavy fighting has also persisted in the area between IDF troops and Hamas fighters.",
      "Videos posted by Hamas fighters show clashes with IDF tanks in the area around the dividing line.",
      "Experts disagree over how long the new partition might be intended to remain in place. Dr Hellyer suggested that it could form the basis of plan to expel Palestinians from the area permanently.",
      "\"Personally I think they're going to settle Jewish settlers in the north, probably in the next 18 months,\" he said. \"They won't call them settlements. To begin with they'll call them outposts or whatever, but that's what they'll be and they'll grow from there.\"",
      "Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said that troops should occupy Gaza and \"encourage\" about half of Palestinian civilians to leave the territory within two years.",
      "But the Israeli government denies that it plans to build settlements in Gaza once the war ends, and Dr Hecht dismissed such suggestions as nothing more than a \"dream\" for some ultranationalist ministers.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 14:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The proposed tariffs, if applied to oil and gas, could hammer Canada's economy and hike prices at the pump for Americans, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "In Canada\u2019s oil-rich province of Alberta, there is a deep sense of unease over President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods.",
      "Canadian politicians and energy experts are warning the hefty tariff would have dire consequences for the economy of America's northern neighbour - and hike prices on US consumers.",
      "\"Canada has no choice in this,\" Dennis McConaghy, an Alberta-based former energy executive, told the BBC.",
      "\"It has to find an accommodation with Trump.\"",
      "Trump announced on Monday that, upon taking office in January, he would slap an across-the-board tariff on Mexico and Canada - with no suggestion that would exclude oil and gas.",
      "It remains unclear whether the tariffs will ultimately materialise, analysts have noted, as Trump has been known to use such threats in the past as a negotiating tactic to achieve his goals.",
      "In this case, Trump has signalled that the levies would remain in place until both Canada and Mexico work on securing their shared borders with the US, limiting the number of unlawful migrants and drugs flowing into the country.",
      "As the threat lingers, Canadian officials and industry leaders are working to meet Trump's demands, while communicating to the public the importance of the Canada-US energy partnership.",
      "Lisa Baiton, president and CEO of the Calgary-based Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the levy would likely mean Canada producing less oil.",
      "Mr McConaghy said that would lead to job losses in Alberta, with potential repercussions for Canada as a whole, as poorer provinces rely on cash transfers from revenues generated by wealthier provinces - like Alberta - to help offset costs and provide social services.",
      "It could also lead to a devaluation of the Canadian dollar at a time when the currency is already struggling due to domestic economic factors, he said.",
      "\u201cKeep in mind, roughly 80% of Canada\u2019s trade is with the United States, and a majority of that trade is in hydrocarbons. Canadians can\u2019t escape how integrated they are with the US.\u201d",
      "US fuel makers have also urged Trump to rule out oil and gas from any proposed levies given that Americans rely heavily on imported Canadian crude.",
      "\u201cCrude oil is to refineries what flour is to bakeries,\u201d said the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) industry group in a statement this week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our number one feedstock and input cost. If those feedstocks were to become significantly more expensive, so too would the overall cost of making fuel here in the United States.\u201d",
      "The US is the world\u2019s largest producer of crude oil and natural gas, but some regions - California, the northeast and parts of the Midwest - do not have the infrastructure or pipeline capacity to rely solely on US oil and need imports to supply fuel to consumers.",
      "Around 40% of the crude that runs through US oil refineries is imported, and the vast majority of it comes from Canada.",
      "Canadian oil is especially relied on in the landlocked Midwest, where refineries have been outfitted to process the heavier Canadian blends.",
      "The AFPM said there is no easy replacement for that crude without relying on overseas sources that could erode US energy security.",
      "The industry group warned that a tariff on Canadian oil would drive up operating costs in the Midwest - costs some experts say will be downloaded onto consumers.",
      "Patrick De Haan, a Chicago-based gas prices analyst, estimated that states like Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan could see gas prices rising by up to 75 cents a gallon.",
      "Mr De Haan noted in a post on X that these higher prices would not only be felt at the pump, but could potentially increase costs for airlines and freight haulers as well.",
      "An increase in oil prices for US consumers would run counter to Trump's promise to slash energy costs.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump frequently said he planned to cut the price of gasoline to under $2 (\u00a31.57) a gallon. As of late November, the price of regular gasoline in the US sat around $3 a gallon.",
      "But Trump has also vowed to increase American energy independence by boosting domestic drilling and being less reliant on foreign oil and gas, particularly from countries not allied with the US.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is promising to present a united \u201cTeam Canada\u201d front and to work together with the incoming Trump administration to avoid the blanket tariffs.",
      "The leaders of major Canadian provinces like Ontario, Quebec and Alberta have urged Trudeau to act quickly on these demands, and on Wednesday, Trudeau held an emergency meeting with provincial and territorial leaders to discuss how to move forward.",
      "Danielle Smith, premier of Alberta, said her province will be \u201cworking aggressively\u201d in the coming months to connect with US counterparts and to drill home the message that a strong partnership with Canada would be of benefit to the US and its energy security.",
      "She said that in her view, Trump \u201cand the tens of millions of Americans who voted for him have valid concerns\u201d related border security.",
      "The number of crossings at the US-Canada border is significantly lower than that at the southern border, according to US Border Patrol data on migrant encounters.",
      "During the 2024 fiscal year, there were around 23,700 apprehensions at the northern land border, while the southern border saw more than 1.53 million apprehensions.",
      "Crossings at the US-Mexico border dropped sharply this summer after reaching record highs earlier under the Biden administration, in part due to efforts by Mexico to implement measures like setting up new checkpoints and increasing patrols.",
      "Canada's immigration minister Marc Miller has said that while crossings at the northern border are much lower, there is still work to be done to stop them.",
      "Smith and other premiers have asked Trudeau to come up with a comprehensive border security plan.",
      "She also said Alberta is exploring the option of creating specialised sheriff units to patrol its own shared border with the US state of Montana.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 22:54:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Three men allegedly using Google Maps for directions died after their car fell off an unfinished bridge.",
    "story": [
      "Can a navigation app be held responsible if a user gets into an accident?",
      "That is the question being asked in India after three men died when their car veered off an unfinished bridge and fell on to a riverbed in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.",
      "Police are still investigating the incident, which took place on Sunday, but they believe that Google Maps led the group to take that route.",
      "A part of the bridge had reportedly collapsed earlier this year because of floods and while locals knew this and avoided the bridge, the three men were not aware of this and were from outside the area. There were no barricades or sign boards indicating that the bridge was unfinished.",
      "Authorities have named four engineers from the state's road department and an unnamed official from Google Maps in a police complaint on charges of culpable homicide.",
      "A spokesperson from Google told BBC Hindi that it was co-operating with the investigation.",
      "The tragic accident has spotlighted India's poor road infrastructure and sparked a debate on whether navigation apps like Google Maps share responsibility for such incidents.",
      "Some blame the app for not providing accurate information while others argue that it is a larger failure on the part of the government for not cordoning off the place.",
      "Google Maps is the most popular navigation app in India and has become synonymous with GPS (Global Positioning System), a satellite-based radio navigation system.",
      "It also powers the services of many ride-sharing, e-commerce and food delivery platforms. The app reportedly has around 60 million active users and witnesses around 50 million searches in a day.",
      "But the app has frequently come under scrutiny for providing incorrect directions, sometimes leading to fatal accidents.",
      "In 2021, a man from Maharashtra state drowned after he drove his car into a dam, allegedly while following directions on the app.",
      "Last year, two young doctors in Kerala state died after they drove their car into a river.  Police said that they had been following a route shown by the app and cautioned people against relying on it too much when roads were flooded.",
      "But how does Google Maps learn about changes on a road?",
      "GPS signals from users\u2019 apps track traffic changes along routes - an increase signals congestion, while a decrease suggests a road is less used. The app also receives updates from governments and users about traffic jams or closures.",
      "Complaints related to high traffic, or the ones notified by authorities are given priority, as Google does not have the manpower to deal with the millions of complaints streaming in daily, says Ashish Nair, the founder of mapping platform Potter Maps and a former Google Maps employee.",
      "\"A map operator then uses satellite imagery, Google Street View and government notifications to confirm the change and update the map.\"",
      "According to Mr Nair, navigating apps cannot be held responsible for mishaps as their terms of services make it clear that users must apply their own judgement on the road and that the information provided by the app might differ from actual conditions.",
      "Besides, it is simply very difficult for a platform like Google, which manages maps across the world, to keep across every change that happens on a road, he adds.",
      "Unlike other countries, India also does not have a robust system for reporting such issues on time.",
      "\"Data remains a big challenge in India. There is no system for infrastructural changes to be logged into a web interface, which can then be used by apps like Google Maps. Countries like Singapore have such a system,\" Mr Nair says.",
      "He adds that India's vast population and fast-paced development make it even more challenging to get accurate, real-time data. \"In other words, bad maps are here to stay until governments become more proactive about collecting and sharing data.\"",
      "Lawyers are divided on whether GPS apps can be held legally responsible for road accidents.",
      "Advocate Saima Khan says that since India's Information Technology (IT) Act gives digital platforms like Google Maps the status of an 'intermediary' (a platform that merely disseminates information provided by a third party) it is protected against liability.",
      "But she adds that if it can be proven that the platform did not rectify its data despite being given correct, timely information, then it might be held liable for   negligence.",

      "Listen to Jeremy read this article",
      "For most of the people of Lebanon, a ceasefire could not come quickly enough. A leading Lebanese analyst at a conference on the Middle East that I\u2019m attending in Rome said she couldn\u2019t sleep as the appointed hour for the ceasefire came closer.",
      "\u201cIt was like the night before Christmas when you\u2019re a kid. I couldn\u2019t wait for it to happen.\u201d",
      "You can see why there\u2019s relief. More than 3,500 citizens of Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes. Displaced people packed their cars before dawn to try to get back to whatever remains of their homes.",
      "Well over one million of them have been forced to flee by Israeli military action. Thousands have been wounded and the homes of tens of thousands of others have been destroyed.",
      "But in Israel, some feel they have lost the chance to do more damage to Hezbollah.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met the heads of Israel\u2019s northern municipalities, which have been turned into ghost towns with around 60,000 civilians evacuated further south.",
      "Israel\u2019s Ynet news website reported that it was an angry meeting that turned into a shouting match, with some of the local officials frustrated that Israel was taking the pressure off their enemies in Lebanon and not offering an immediate plan to get civilians home.",
      "In a newspaper column, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, close to the border, said he doubted the ceasefire would be enforced, demanding that Israel creates a buffer zone in south Lebanon. In a poll commissioned by the Israeli station Channel 12 News those questioned were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the ceasefire.",
      "Half of the participants in the survey believe Hezbollah has not been defeated and 30% think the ceasefire will collapse.",
      "Back in late September, at the UN General Assembly in New York, a deal looked as if it was close. Diplomats from the US and UK were convinced that a ceasefire very similar to the one that is now coming into force was about to happen.",
      "All sides in the war appeared to have signalled their willingness to accept a ceasefire based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed to end the 2006 Lebanon war: Hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces. As they moved in, Israeli forces would gradually move out.",
      "But Prime Minister Netanyahu went to the podium at the UN to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "Back at his New York hotel Netanyahu\u2019s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with most of his high command. Netanyahu\u2019s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for American diplomacy.",
      "The assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to Hezbollah. In the weeks since, Israel\u2019s military has inflicted immense damage to Hezbollah\u2019s military organisation. It could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage Israel\u2019s invasion force. But Hezbollah is no longer the same threat to Israel.",
      "Netanyahu: Time to 'replenish stocks\u2019",
      "Military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade Benjamin Netanyahu that this is a good time to stop.",
      "Israel\u2019s agenda in Lebanon is more limited than in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. It wants to push Hezbollah back from its northern border and to allow civilians to return to border towns.",
      "If Hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, Israel has a side letter from the Americans agreeing that it can take military action.",
      "In a recorded statement announcing his decision, Netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. Israel, he said, had made the ground in Beirut shake. Now there was a chance \u2018to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,\u2019 he continued.",
      "Israel had also broken the connection between Gaza and Lebanon. After the late Hassan Nasrallah ordered the attacks on Israel\u2019s north, the day after Hamas went to war on 7 October last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Now, Netanyahu said, Hamas in Gaza would be under even more pressure. Palestinians fear another escalation in Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive.",
      "There was one more reason; to concentrate on what Netanyahu called the Iranian threat. Damaging Hezbollah means damaging Iran. It was built up by the Iranians to create a threat right on Israel\u2019s border. Hezbollah became the strongest part of Iran\u2019s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies.",
      "Why Iran wanted a ceasefire",
      "Just like Hezbollah\u2019s surviving leaders, their patrons in Iran also wanted a ceasefire. Hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. Iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. Its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel after Nasrallah\u2019s assassination did not repair the damage.",
      "Two men, both now assassinated, designed Hezbollah to deter Israel not just from attacking Lebanon \u2013 but also from attacking Iran. They were Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed by an American drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The order was issued by Donald Trump in his last few weeks in the White House at the end of his first term. The other was Hassan Nasrallah, killed by a huge Israeli air strike in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.",
      "Hezbollah and Iran\u2019s deterrence strategy matched Israel\u2019s own deterrence for almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. But among the profound changes caused by the 7 October attacks was Israel\u2019s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. America, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing.",
      "Nasrallah and Iran failed to see what had happened. They did not understand how Israel had changed.  They sought to impose a war of attrition on Israel, and succeeded for almost a year. Then on 17 September Israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped Hezbollah into buying.",
      "Hezbollah was thrown off balance. Before it could react with the most powerful weapons Iran had provided, Israel killed Nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. That was followed by an invasion of South Lebanon and the wholesale destruction of Lebanese border villages as well as Hezbollah\u2019s tunnel network.",
      "Trump, Gaza and the future",
      "A ceasefire in Lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in Gaza. Gaza is different. The war there is about more than security of the border, and Israeli hostages.",
      "It is also about revenge, about Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s political survival, and his government\u2019s absolute rejection of Palestinian aspirations for independence.",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is fragile and deliberately paced to buy time for it to work. When the 60 days in which it is supposed to take effect ends, Donald Trump will be back in the Oval Office. President-elect Trump has indicated that he wants a ceasefire in Lebanon, but his precise plans have not yet emerged.",
      "The Middle East is waiting for the ways he might affect the region. Some optimists hope that he might want to create a moment akin to President Nixon\u2019s sensational visit to China in 1972 by reaching out to Iran.",
      "The pessimists fear he might abandon even the hollow genuflection that the US still makes to the idea of a creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel \u2013 the so-called two state solution. That might pave the way to annexation of those parts of the occupied Palestinian territories Israel wants, including much of the West Bank and northern Gaza.",
      "What is certain though is that the Middle East has no chance of escaping more generations of war and violent death until the region\u2019s fundamental political ruptures are faced and fixed. The biggest is the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, along with most Israelis believe it is possible to dominate their enemies by pressing on to a military victory. Netanyahu is actively using force, unrestrained by the US, to alter the balance of power in the Middle East in Israel\u2019s favour.",
      "In a conflict that has lasted more than a century both Arabs and Jews have dreamt repeatedly of peace through military victory. Every generation has tried and failed. The catastrophic consequences of the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 ripped away any pretence that the conflict could be managed while Israel continued to deny Palestinian rights to self-determination. The ceasefire in Lebanon is a respite. It is not a solution.",

      "Taylor Swift's latest release isn't a new song or album \u2014 it's a book commemorating the pop star's\u00a0record-setting\u00a0\"Eras Tour,\" which hit store shelves on Black Friday.",
      "The collector's item chronicles Swift's wildly successful concert tour, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Some Target stores opened as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of Black Friday shopping crowds and Taylor Swift fans.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period of her career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",
      "\"Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched, and they are shopping carefully,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a Nov. 20 earnings call.",

      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others' points of view.\"",
      "\"On reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\" the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\"",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",

I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\"",

      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \"CBS This Morning,\" and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \"CBS This Morning.\"",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment while working, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. Harris and McNeal alleged that Rose said \"they were hired because he likes 'tall women,' i.e., he was attracted to them,\" and Wei alleged that Rose referred to her \"as China doll.\"\u00a0 The three women also accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",

      "Rapper Drake's company Frozen Moments filed a petition in a New York court Monday accusing the streaming service Spotify and Universal Music Group of conspiring to inflate the streams of Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track \"Not Like Us.\"",
      "\"Not Like Us,\" the result of Lamar and Drake's weekslong beef, broke records on the Billboard rap charts, retaining the top spot all summer. Frozen Moments, described in the filing as \"an entity wholly owned by Drake,\" alleges that UMG \"launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves\" with \"Not Like Us\" via bots and pay-for-play agreements.",
      "The filing alleges the song was licensed to Spotify at a 30% discount in exchange for a boost in recommendations to users \u2014 the track now has over 900 million streams on Spotify, according to the service. The petition also alleges UMG used bots to drive up the streams on \"Not Like Us,\" paid radio promoters to increase air play and even paid tech giant Apple to have its voice assistant Siri misdirect users to Lamar's hit song.",
      "A spokesperson for UMG called the allegations \"offensive and untrue.\"",
      "\"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "When reached by CBS News, a publicist for Drake Tuesday had no comment. Spotify, Apple and representatives for Lamar did not immediately respond to CBS News requests for comment.",
      "According to the Associated Press, Drake on Tuesday filed a second legal action against UMG, but in Texas, also over \"Not Like Us.\" According to the AP, Tuesday's filing in Bexar County accuses UMG of engaging in \"irregular and inappropriate business practices\" to get radio airplay for \"Not Like Us,\" including making illegal payments to San Antonio-based iHeartMedia.",

They mistaken, 'cause Google saying Lucian, but that just doesn't make sense. Who filling up the piggy bank? Who bringing home the bacon?\" The line seems to indicate Drake's perceived importance to the label as Spotify's second most streamed artist behind Taylor Swift, whose Big Machine Records is also distributed by UMG.",

      "The legal action comes days after Lamar released \"GNX,\" his first album since the beef.

    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

      "Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday. An obituary\u00a0was also posted to her website.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \"Breaking the Rules\" and \"Act of Will,\" she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis.",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\"And if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\" Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford's maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \"powerhouse of glamour and warmth\" and a \"force of nature\" who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\"Success never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\" Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\"",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \"lanky and disheveled with acne,\" and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \"Out walked the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: 'Don't you wish you'd gone to the pictures with him now?' I never got over Peter's transformation.\"",
      "According to the obituary on her website, when Bradford was recently asked what would be on her epitaph, she replied: \"She made her dreams come true.\"",
      "According to the obituary, Bradford will be laid to rest alongside her husband at Westchester Hills Cemetery, New York following a private funeral at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.",

      "The island of Maui is a mere dot in the enormity of the vast Pacific Ocean, but it's not hard to see why millions visit every year, and why there are some who never want to leave. Fleetwood Mac founder Mick Fleetwood fell in love with Maui decades ago, and put down deep roots. \"Long story, a long love affair,\" he said.",
      "\"But it really is your heart and your home?\" I asked.",
      "\"Uh-huh. People often think, 'Oh yeah, how often are you on Maui?'\" Fleetwood said. \"This is my home. No other place.\"",
      "As a young man he'd dreamed of a place, a club, where he could get his friends together, and 12 years ago he made it happen in the west Maui city of Lahaina:\u00a0 Fleetwood's on Front Street. The menu was eclectic \u2013 they served everything from Biddie's Chicken (just like Fleetwood's mom, Biddie, made it) to cookie dough desserts dreamed up by his children. It was also a place where Mick and friends could play. \"We created, I created, a band of people under a roof,\" he said. \"Instead of a traveling circus, it was a resident circus at Fleetwood's on Front Street.\"",

      "\"No.\"",
      "\"But at the same time, this was your family. This was your home. That must've been a huge loss.\"",
      "\"It was a huge loss,\" Fleetwood said. \"And in the reminding of it, that wave comes back. Today knowing we're doing this, I go, like,\u00a0Okay, this is gonna be \u2026 a day.\"",
      "We took a walk with Fleetwood down the street where his place once stood: the last time he was here, the place was still smoldering. \"Literally, parts of it were still hot,\" he said.",
      "More than a year later, the Lahaina waterfront is still very much a disaster zone.",
      "The decision about what to do with the land is still up in the air; the priority is housing for the displaced residents. But Fleetwood says he's determined to rebuild, just maybe not in the same place.",
      "Asked what he pictures in a new place, he said, \"For me, it has to encompass being able to handle playing music. There has to be music. We had it every day. That's a selfish request!\"",
      "But before anything is rebuilt, there's still a massive cleanup that needs to be completed here.",
      "\"We will see,\" he said. \"You have a blank [canvas] to paint on, and there's a lot of painting to do.",
      "\"You have to be careful, even in this conversation, of going like, 'How sad that was,' when really it's about, 'Yes, but now we need this.' In the end you go like, it happened. And what's really important is absorbing maybe how all these things happened, and can they be circumnavigated to be more safe in the future, and be more aware? Of course that's part of it. But the real, real essence is the future.\"",

      "Barry Enderwick is eating his way through history, one sandwich at a time. Every day from his home in San Jose, California, Enderwick posts a cooking video from a recipe that time forgot. From the 1905 British book \"Salads, Sandwiches and Savouries,\" Enderwick prepared the New York Sandwich.",
      "The recipe called for 24 oysters, minced and mixed with mayonnaise, seasoned with lemon juice and pepper, and spread over buttered day-old French bread.",
      "Rescuing recipes from the dustbin of history doesn't always lead to culinary success. Sampling his New York Sandwich, Enderwick decried it as \"a textural wasteland. No, thank you.\"\u00a0 Into the trash bin it went!",
      "But Enderwick's efforts have yielded his own cookbook, a collection of some of the strangest \u2013 and sometimes unexpectedly delicious \u2013 historical recipes you've never heard of.",
      "He even has a traveling stage show: \"Sandwiches of History Live.\"",
      "From the condiments to the sliced bread, this former Netflix executive has become something of a sandwich celebrity. \"You can put just about anything in-between two slices of bread,\" he said. \"And it's portable! In general, a sandwich is pretty easy fare. And so, they just have universal appeal.\"",
      "Though the sandwich gets its name famously from the Fourth Earl of Sandwich, the earliest sandwich Enderwick has eaten dates from 200 B.C.E. China, a seared beef sandwich called Rou Jia Mo.",
      "He declared it delicious. \"Between the onions, and all those spices and the soy sauce \u2026 oh my God! Oh man, this is so good!\"",
      "While Elvis was famous for his peanut butter and banana concoction, Enderwick says there's another celebrity who should be more famous for his sandwich: Gene Kelly, who he says had \"the greatest man sandwich in the world, which was basically mashed potatoes on bread. And it was delicious.\"",
      "Whether it's a peanut and sardine sandwich (from \"Blondie's Cook Book\" from 1947), or the parmesian radish sandwich (from 1909's \"The Up-To-Date Sandwich Book\"), Enderwick tries to get a taste of who we were \u2013 good or gross \u2013 one recipe at a time.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 09:52:13 -0500",
    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal panel has been meeting for months to draft recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A monthslong process to decide the federal government's food recommendations for the next five years is now set to stretch well into 2025. That timing means Biden officials will miss their opportunity to lock in new guidelines before the Trump administration takes over.",
      "Switching terms in the middle of an update is unprecedented in recent history, though previous versions have come close: an update in 2005 was finished days before the inauguration and the 2020 revision came a month before Biden took office.",
      "The guidelines are hotly contested in Washington because they influence a broad array of federal programs, ranging from rules on nutrition labels to standards for school lunches. They are traditionally based around a scientific report from outside experts.",
      "That committee has been meeting since last year, wrestling with an array of controversial questions, and is not expected to issue its recommendations until mid-December. It usually takes several months after their report is done for officials to publish their guidelines.",
      "This timeline was decided long before Election Day, one person familiar with the process told CBS News.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not comment on the timing of the report, except to confirm that it is expected \"later in the year.\"",
      "\"HHS and USDA continue to demonstrate their commitment to transparency, equity, and scientific integrity throughout the entire process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It is virtually impossible for the Biden administration to finish an update before leaving office, former officials said. Too many tasks remain, like vetting the findings and developing and testing updated messaging through tools like MyPlate, which replaced the food pyramid.",
      "\"This is a very heavy lift, given the complexity and given the points of view of the different departments,\" said Dr. Brett Giroir, who served as assistant secretary for health in HHS under the Trump administration's last revision.",
      "Input from the public and agencies also must be worked into the guidelines, before the agriculture and health departments can come to an agreement.",
      "\"My belief is that when Congress tells two agencies to collaborate on something, that is an intended tension, hopefully to move the final product in the right direction. And I think certainly folks would agree that HHS and USDA often come from different constituencies, different perspectives,\" said Brandon Lipps, who was the USDA's deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services under Trump.",
      "One expected fight will be over proposals floated last month by members of the committee \"to emphasize plant sources\" of protein, as part of a broader recommendation to \"shift\" to more \"nutrient dense, plant-based meals.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump had accused his rival of wanting to \"stop people from eating red meat.\" In a statement last month, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association denounced the recommendations as \"unhinged\" and \"impractical.\"",
      "Under the drafts, beans, peas and lentils could be listed as protein sources too, not just vegetables. Red meat would be moved down the ranking of protein foods, over health concerns like cardiovascular disease.",
      "Red meats often needed to be substituted the most in American diets, analyses by the committee concluded, to cut health risks and still meet nutritional goals.",
      "\"Red meats, whether they were processed or not, were the ones to reduce more than the poultry or the eggs. So I would've put them very last,\" said Christopher Gardner, a member of the committee.",
      "How Trump administration officials could change the guidelines",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to the committee a central part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.",
      "\"What we need to do is change the panel, so they're making good recommendations and they're telling people don't eat these foods,\" Kennedy said in September.",
      "They could also offer Kennedy a vehicle to accomplish his goals, like curbing ultra-processed foods in school lunches. If confirmed as secretary, Kennedy and his counterpart at USDA would have the ultimate authority over what goes into the guidelines.",
      "\"If Congress wanted a group of scientists to write the dietary guidelines, they would have put that in statute. So the committee makes recommendations, and the secretaries take the input from that report,\" said Lipps.",
      "Completely ignoring the committee's work would be unprecedented, though departments in the past \u2013 often driven by career civil servants \u2013 have sometimes disagreed with some recommendations.",
      "\"The process is not perfect, there's bureaucracy in there. But I do believe having transparent scientific committees that everybody knows where it's coming from is the best way to go,\" said Giroir.",

    "summary": "When it comes to eating healthy, all of us respond to foods differently. The National Institutes of Health's new nutrition study hopes to finally provide Americans a personalized answer to the question: \"What should I eat?\"",
    "story": [
      "It's been said the best meals come from the heart, not from a recipe book. But at this USDA kitchen, there's no pinch of this, dash of that, no dollops or smidgens of anything. Here, nutritionists in white coats painstakingly measure every single ingredient, down to the tenth of a gram.",
      "Sheryn Stover is expected to eat every crumb of her pizza; any tiny morsels she does miss go back to the kitchen, where they're scrutinized like evidence of some dietary crime.",
      "Stover (or participant #8180, as she's known) is one of some 10,000 volunteers enrolled in a $170 million nutrition study run by the National Institutes of Health. \"At 78, not many people get to do studies that are going to affect a great amount of people, and I thought this was a great opportunity to do that,\" she said.",
      "It's called the Nutrition for Precision Health Study. \"When I tell people about the study, the reaction usually is, 'Oh, that's so cool, can I do it?'\" said coordinator Holly Nicastro.",
      "She explained just what \"precise\" precisely means: \"Precision nutrition means tailoring nutrition or dietary guidance to the individual.\"",
      "The government has long offered guidelines to help us eat better. In the 1940s we had the \"Basic 7.\" In the '50s, the \"Basic 4.\" We've had the \"Food Wheel,\" the \"Food Pyramid,\" and currently, \"My Plate.\"",
      "They're all well-intentioned, except they're all based on averages \u2013 what works best for most people, most of the time. But according to Nicastro, there is no one best way to eat. \"We know from virtually every nutrition study ever conducted, we have inner individual variability,\" she said. \"That means we have some people that are going to respond, and some people that aren't. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"",
      "The study's participants, like Stover, are all being drawn from another NIH study program called All Of Us, a massive undertaking to create a database of at least a million people who are volunteering everything from their electronic health records to their DNA. \u00a0It was from that All of Us research that Stover discovered she has the gene that makes some foods taste bitter, which could explain why she ate more of one kind of food than another.",
      "Professor Sai Das, who oversees the study at Tufts University, says the goal of precision nutrition is to drill down even deeper into those individual differences. \"We're moving away from just saying everybody go do this, to being able to say, 'Okay, if you have X, Y and Z characteristics, then you're more likely to respond to a diet, and somebody else that has A, B and C characteristics will be responding to the diet differently,'\" Das said.",
      "It's a big commitment for Stover, who is one of 150 people being paid to live at a handful of test sites around the country for six weeks \u2013 two weeks at a time. It's so precise she can't even go for a walk without a dietary chaperone. \"Well, you could stop and buy candy \u2026 God forbid, you can't do that!\" she laughed.",
      "While she's here, everything from her resting metabolic rate, her body fat percentage, her bone mineral content, even the microbes in her gut (digested by a machine that essentially is a smart toilet paper reading device) are being analyzed for how hers may differ from someone else's.",
      "Nicastro said, \"We really think that what's going on in your poop is going to tell us a lot of information about your health and how you respond to food.\"",
      "Stover says she doesn't mind, except for the odd sounds the machine makes. While she is a live-in participant, thousands of others are participating from their homes, where electronic wearables track all kinds of health data, including special glasses that record everything they eat, activated when someone starts chewing. Artificial intelligence can then be used to determine not only which foods the person is eating, but how many calories are consumed.",
      "This study is expected to be wrapped up by 2027, and because of it, we may indeed know not only to eat more fruits and vegetables, but what combination of foods is really best for us. \u00a0The question that even Holly Nicastro can't answer is, will we listen? \"You can lead a horse to water; you can't make them drink,\" she said. \"We can tailor the interventions all day. But one hypothesis I have is that if the guidance is tailored to the individual, it's going to make that individual more likely to follow it, because this is for me, this was designed for me.\"",

      "Friday was an abbreviated trading day, with stocks closing at 1 p.m. ET and the bond market an hour later.",
      "Investors were looking to see how much shoppers are willing to spend on gifts for the holidays, with forecasts that shoppers could break spending records in 2024, with the typical consumer expected to spend more than $1,000, a 14% increase from last year. Black Friday unofficially kicked off the holiday shopping season, although retailers had been offering early deals for weeks.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:17:16 -0500",
    "summary": "As the holiday shopping season kicks off, here are five ways retailers try to get consumers to spend.",
    "story": [
      "As shoppers gear up for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, it can be easy for people to rack up debt that will weigh them down well into the new year. So it pays for consumers to be aware of some of the tactics retailers employ to get them to spend.",
      "For example, most offers that dangle savings in the form of free shipping or a free gift if you spend over a certain amount don't save you money. The practice, called \"spaving,\" or spending more in order to save, rarely benefits consumers, according to personal finance experts.",
      "\"I understand the appeal of getting to checkout and a notification pops up saying spend $10 more to get some perk,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But 90% of the time when you break it down, it doesn't make sense. You're not actually saving money if you are spending more of it.\"",
      "Here are five tactics retailers use to get you to spend more, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Creating a false sense of urgency",
      "The fear of missing out on a good deal can nudge consumers into making impulse buys. Although some offers really are only valid for a limited time, U.S. PIRG identified a number of sellers on Etsy, an e-commerce site for independent craftspeople, who used fake countdown clocks for deals that never expire.",
      "Of 20 top-selling products on the site with countdown timers on deals, 80% of them simply reset when their tickers tickers hit \"0,\" according to a PIRG study.",
      "\"The 'limited' time window may not be as limited as it sounds and the deals not as good as they seem,\" U.S. PIRG's R.J. Cross told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Make your list, comparison shop on those items, and don't get distracted by offers you haven't had the time to think through.\"",
      "Implying scarcity",
      "Online retailers may label products as \"selling fast!\" or, as a consumer is considering a purchase, display how many other consumers are browsing the same item.",
      "\"Retailers and advertisers are always trying to get you to buy more than you need and spend more than you want,\" Cross said in a statement.\u00a0\"Once you know what to look for, you end up chuckling when you see these tactics instead of falling for them.\"",
      "Pricing tricks",
      "Ever wonder why a price reads $4.99 and not simply $5? When sellers round an item's price down, it suggests to a shopper that it is cheaper, PIRG notes. Although $4.99 is only a penny less than $5, a shopper is more likely to fixate on the dollar figure \u2014 $4 \u2014 versus the cents.",
      "Even removing a comma from a high sticker price like $1,200 and displaying it as $1200 can entice someone to pull the trigger, according to PIRG. Meanwhile, breaking the cost of an item down into monthly installments can also make the price seem smaller than it really is, the organization noted.",
      "\"You're still going to have to pay the full cost, and sometimes\u00a0even more in late fees, if you're not careful,\" Cross pointed out.",
      "Dubious testimonials",
      "Many retailers feature online testimonials ostensibly from customers raving about a \"life-changing\" vacuum cleaner or pair of sweatpants. Some of these account are from real customers, while other reviews cannot be trusted because they have been generated by a bot or the company itself, PIRG said.",
      "At bottom, it's a form of peer pressure \u2014 shoppers are subtly induced to think that buying the product will make them as happy as the satisfied customers depicted in the testimonial. In reality, many online reviews are fake, especially as AI bots proliferate.",
      "\"When you look at reviews on a product, don't necessarily take the star ratings for granted. Better to look through the comments and find those that seem real \u2014 that either include a picture of the product or that make a point specific to the product instead of a generic note like 'great product!'\" Cross recommends.",
      "Appeals based on fear",
      "Many marketing pitches and ads suggest that your life will somehow be worse if you don't make a purchase, from being at risk of a home invasion to hair loss. With e-commerce, of course, such messages are tailored to your individual interests and tastes given that website cookies track and share your browsing patterns with retailers.",
      "Messages \"about how to fix our perceived flaws only become more capable of finding us at all hours of the day whenever we go online,\" Cross said.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Some companies are weaving Trump's tariffs into their marketing efforts, telling consumers to buy now in case prices rise.",
    "story": [
      "Some retailers are using President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs to urge consumers to shop now, suggesting if the import duties go into effect next year, a\u00a0range of goods could cost Americans a lot more money.",
      "It's yet another sales tactic some companies are implementing, in addition to the traditional Black Friday discounts, to get consumers to spend as much as possible ahead of the holidays.",
      "On Monday, Trump pledged to add a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The proposed taxes are in addition to earlier campaign promises to impose a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, once he takes office.",
      "While\u00a0prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise if Trump moves forward with his tariff proposals, some retail experts say that retailers may be seeking to tap into people's universal fear of missing out on a limited-time offer or experience. But the tactic could also rub some shoppers the wrong way, experts caution.",
      "\"It's a double-edged sword. I think it it might get people interested in buying things, but it could also split consumers if they think everyone's going to bring their prices up,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. \"The other problem is it's slightly political as well, so some retailers would want to steer clear of it.\"",
      "While Trump has said he plans to move forward with tariffs, some economists have pointed out that the next administration may simply use the duties as a bargaining chip, which could enable the White House to strike new trade deals, for instance. Even though the tariffs are far from certain, a number of companies have explicitly said the levies floated by Trump would inevitably force them to raise prices for consumers.",
      "\"Lock in our current prices\"",
      "For example, filtered shower head maker Jolie recently said it would have pass along some of the anticipated costs from the tariffs to consumers. In a recent email to customers, the company said that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy CEO Corie Barry similarly said on its latest earnings call that the goods it sells could become more expensive under Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors on Nov. 26, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"Pre-tariff\" sales",
      "And on Facebook, a Dallas, Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings, announced a \"pre-tariff sale\" that runs until January, earlier this month.",
      "\"Get a deal while you still can,\" the retailer said.",
      "Finally Home Furnishings did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, or indicate how much it expects it may need to hike prices if new tariffs go into effect.",
      "Etsy seller Buzzy Park, who sells handmade bamboo picture frames, also advertised a \"pre-tariff \" sale on his entire inventory, starting this month and lasting until any new tariffs go into effect. \"Hurry and get them at their current prices,\" Park wrote in a social media post.",
      "While prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise, some marketing and retail experts say that even sellers who don't expect to face added costs could be using potential tariffs as an excuse to charge customers more.",
      "\"If consumers panic about things getting more expensive, they are playing right into the hands of companies around the country to use it as an excuse to raise prices, even when it's not necessary,\" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group. \"",
      "He added, It's a pretty handy excuse when you are in a constant battle with consumers on price.\"",

    "summary": "Target is the only place you can buy the latest Taylor Swift merch, including a new book, vinyl and CD.",
    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's latest release isn't a new song or album \u2014 it's a book commemorating the pop star's\u00a0record-setting\u00a0\"Eras Tour,\" which hit store shelves on Black Friday.",
      "The collector's item chronicles Swift's wildly successful concert tour, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Some Target stores opened as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of Black Friday shopping crowds and Taylor Swift fans.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period of her career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",
      "\"Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched, and they are shopping carefully,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a Nov. 20 earnings call.",
      "That restraint seems unlikely to deter the Swifties, the singer's rabid fans, as she prepares to wind up the Eras Tour in Vancouver on Dec. 8.",

      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",

    "summary": "Experts warn of fabricated websites posing as retailers to scam shoppers looking for Black Friday deals.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are warning that fraudsters are exploiting Black Friday sales to target U.S. shoppers with fake websites and ads for major brands like IKEA, Wayfair and The North Face, after online scams hit record highs in 2023.",
      "A new report released by threat intelligence company EclecticIQ identified a campaign that operates a sprawling network of fabricated websites using \"Trusted Store\" badges to lure shoppers with fake products.",
      "When consumers attempt to make a purchase, scammers steal their personal and payment information. The consumers are often unaware they were scammed until they fail to receive the product.",
      "Reports of online fraud in 2023 exceeded $12.5 billion in potential losses \u2014   a 22% jump from 2022, according to FBI data. Officials say increasingly sophisticated scams are using tools including AI to power their campaigns.",
      "\"With the way it now seems like everyone is shopping online, reliance on digital platforms has handed these groups a wider attack surface than ever,\" EclecticIQ CEO Cody Barrow told CBS News. \"Unfortunately, it's likely we'll see its impact stretch into next week.\"",
      "The scams",
      "EclecticIQ says it identified at least 8,000 fabricated sites that lure shoppers by offering steep \"deals\" on popular brands. The websites are not affiliated with the brands they appear to represent, but are designed to look like official sites and use URLs that appear authentic.",
      "In one example, a site posing as Wayfair used the URL wayfairtoday.com. Another site used the URL wayfairblackfriday.com. The website was registered in early November and offered fake \"deals\" including an $800 mattress reduced to $39.",
      "CBS News also found an ad appropriating Wayfair's logo that directed users to another counterfeit site posing as the retailer. It was removed from Meta's ad library as of Friday. Wayfair told CBS News that it is actively monitoring scams to ensure customers are protected.",
      "Analysts discovered Mandarin coding and Chinese IP addresses on the sites, indicating that the phishing campaign was operated by a China-based group. IKEA told CBS News it was investigating one of the scam websites using its name that EclecticIQ identified.",
      "Separately, an ad on Facebook and Instagram using The North Face logo routed users to a fabricated site. The ad was removed for policy violations, and The North Face told CBS News it was working with Meta and \"other partners\" to combat scam sites.",
      "\"Scammers use every online platform available to them and constantly evolve their tactics in order to evade enforcement,\" said Meta spokesperson Erin Logan. \"In this instance, our systems proactively detected and removed a number of these ads before they were reported to us.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission released data in February that shows online shopping fraud was the second most common type of fraud reported in 2023.",
      "Experts say fraudulent sites and ads remain a pervasive issue. \"Many of the scam sites are short-lived campaigns, so it's an ongoing effort to identify new sites,\" Ilya Volovik, director of Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence, told CBS News. \"Some of the longer living scam sites change their 'sales' advertisement based on a holiday.\"",
      "Tips to protect yourself",
      "Cliff Steinhauer, director of Information Security and Engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, said consumers should take precautions, stay alert when online shopping and act quickly if they believe they have been scammed.",
      "Secure your accounts. Experts recommend setting up multifactor authentication as well as strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including shopping and bank sites.",
      "Avoid unfamiliar links: Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages. Instead, use a search engine to navigate to the retailer's website.",
      "Look for red flags. Be wary of deals that appear too good to be true, as well as websites that use excessive pop-ups and urgent language. If in doubt, leave the site.",
      "Research the website. Look up reviews from other shoppers who have used the site. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website, which maintains a database with ratings for millions of businesses.",
      "If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately notify your bank to reverse the charges. You should also change the passwords to your online accounts. File a police report if you experience harassment or repeated attempts to steal more of your information.",
      "Experts also recommend freezing your credit on the three major credit reporting bureaus if your personal information has been compromised through a data breach. This will ensure your identity can't be stolen in the event that scammers obtain your social security number.",

    "story": [
      "Experts say a volley of tariffs between the U.S. and Canada could tip both countries into a recession and severely disrupt cross-border commerce between the key trading partners.",
      "A Canadian government official said Wednesday it is exploring potential retaliatory levies on certain U.S. imports after President-elect Donald Trump on Monday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. The official, who stressed no final decision has been taken, spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Trump tariffs could make these items more expensiveHere's why Trump thinks tariffs are good for the U.S. - and what the experts sayTrump tariffs on Canada imports could lead to sharply higher gas prices, experts warn",

      "Here's why Trump thinks tariffs are good for the U.S. - and what the experts say",
      "Trump tariffs on Canada imports could lead to sharply higher gas prices, experts warn",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier this week also hinted that the country could retaliate against the U.S. with its own tariffs on American products. Trump said the stepped-up duties are necessary to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs from Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Blanket 25% tariffs on Canada threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week would push Canada into a recession in 2025, cause a sharp spike in inflation and force the Bank of Canada to hold rates higher next year,\" economist Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics said in a report Thursday.",
      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",
      "Canada fired back with duties of its own when Trump slapped tariffs on the country's steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. during his first stint in the White House. Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about an influx of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "U.S. also would feel the pain",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have said\u00a0tariffs deployed during his first term advanced U.S. economic aims, including boosting federal revenue, and didn't boost inflation.",
      "But the U.S. likely wouldn't go unscathed in a full-blown trade war with Canada. Across-the-board tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S. and fracture political relations between the allies, according to Oxford.",
      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, Canada supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied the tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With so much on the line, the incoming Trump administration is more likely to impose limited tariffs on Canadian products, such as steel, lumber and farm products like dairy.",
      "\"Despite Trump's latest threat of blanket tariffs, we still think it's unlikely that the Trump administration will put tariffs on Canadian autos and energy exports, which make up about 40% of total Canadian exports to the U.S.,\" Davenport said. \"The North American energy sector and auto supply chains are highly integrated across the U.S.-Canada border and any tariffs on these goods would also have a significant negative effect on the US economy.\"",

      "An Arizona produce company is recalling whole cucumbers distributed in 26 states and Canada because they could contain salmonella.",

Salmonella can cause fatal infections in young children, elderly people or other individuals with weakened immune systems.",
      "The recall applies to all sizes of SunFed whole, fresh cucumbers.

Some of the recalled cucumbers also could have ended up at retail outlets beyond those states.",
      "The cucumbers were also sold in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Calgary, Ontario and Saskatchewan.",
      "Consumer are urged to check their own produce against images of the potentially affected products and to refrain from consuming or distributing suspect cucumbers. Recalled products should be destroyed, SunFed said.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump this week said he would enact a 25% tariff on all products from both countries, citing concerns about illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. While prices could climb on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S., the potential impact on motorists and on the transportation sector could be particularly acute, analysts say.",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are huge U.S. trading partners, so it's a shot across the bow of longtime U.S. allies,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For a lot of the U.S., it could be problematic for what they pay at the pump,\" De Haan said of the tariffs' impact, in particular to inland regions such as the Great Lakes, Midwest and the Rockies. \"The coastal areas have more options \u2014 they don't rely as much on Canadian crude.\"",

      "The threatened tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada could also result in a $3,000 increase in the cost of the average car, according to Wolfe Research analysts cited by the Wall Street Journal. Roughly $97 billion in auto parts are imported to the U.S. from the two nations annually, and 4 million vehicles are shipped in \u2014 roughly 3 million from Mexico and 1 million from Canada, the firm estimated.",
      "To be sure, it remains uncertain if Trump will follow through on his trade threats. Some analysts think the president-elect is likely using the specter of tariffs as a way to wring concessions from other countries, noting that his administration will be eager to avoid setting off another round of inflation just as U.S. prices are growing at a normal level.",
      "\"We would be surprised if [the tariffs] were ever actually implemented,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics wrote in a report, noting that the auto sectors in the Canada, Mexico and the U.S. are tightly interconnected.",

      "Best Buy CEO Cory Barrie on Tuesday also said on the company's earnings call that Trump's proposed tariffs would force the retailer to raise costs on a\u00a0range of consumer electronics, noting that \"there's very little in consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Footwear",
      "Footwear is another goods category that experts are watching. According to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries, with 56% of footwear by volume coming from China.",
      "\"We know that if they apply tariffs on Chines goods and Chinese footwear, it will hit working families the hardest,\" FDRA CEO Matt Priest told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some retailers could also decide to hike prices whether or not they face added costs related to potential tariffs. \"It's a pretty handy excuse when you're in a constant battle with consumers on price,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Home goods",
      "A number of retailers have already suggested that the proposed tariffs could force them to raise prices. In an email to customers, filtered shower head maker Jolie said this week that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Home furnishings giant Ikea told CNN that Trump's tariffs, if enacted, would make it more difficult for the company to keep its prices low.",
      "\"Tariffs make it more difficult for us to maintain the low prices and be affordable for many people, which in the end is our goal,\" Jesper Brodin, Ingka Group CEO, told CNN. \"But it's beyond our control. We will need to understand and adapt.\"",
      "Gasoline",
      "Adding a 25% tariff to Canadian imports would affect crude oil, which is imported from Western Canada and refined at U.S. facilities, according to Patrick De Haan, an analyst at Gas Buddy.",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are huge U.S. trading partners, so it's a shot across the bow of longtime U.S. allies,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For a lot of the U.S., it could be problematic for what they pay at the pump,\" De Haan said of the tariffs' impact, in particular to inland regions such as the Great Lakes, Midwest and the Rockies. \"The coastal areas have more options \u2014 they don't rely as much on Canadian crude.\"",
      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, we still import a lot of crude, with Canada providing roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, within as little as two days after the tariffs take effect, De Haan said.",
      "So should consumers be thinking about buying certain products now ahead of possible tariffs next year? Brzytwa thinks so.",
      "\"People should be thinking about buying now. From all indications we have, the Trump administration wants to move as fast as possible to impose much higher tariffs on imports from China, including products not yet subject to tariffs,\" he said.",
      "He added, \"If I am a consumer thinking about something I would want to buy next year and know price might go up, I'd want to buy it sooner rather than later.\"",
      "Trump speaks with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum",
      "In a\u00a0post\u00a0to his Truth Social platform Wednesday evening, Trump said that he \"just had a wonderful conversation\" with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, during which he alleged that Sheinbaum \"agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our southern border.\"",
      "He said the two also spoke about \"what can be done to stop the massive drug inflow into\" the U.S.",
      "Sheinbaum responded with her own\u00a0social media post, writing that in her \"conversation\" with Trump she \"explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights. Thanks to this, migrants and caravans are assisted before they reach the border. We reiterate that Mexico's position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples.\"",
      "This comes\u00a0a day after\u00a0Sheinbaum indicated that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own if Trump followed through with his threat to impose tariffs on Mexico.",

    "title": "How Trump's economic agenda could affect mortgage rates in 2025",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what a noted housing expert thinks will happen to mortgage rates next year as Donald Trump outlines his priorities.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised to lower prices for Americans, but his economic policies may not help one embattled part of the economy: the housing market.",
      "Mortgage rates continue to hover near a 20-year high, while house hunters face near record high\u00a0home prices. The Federal Reserve's two rate cuts, in September and November, haven't trickled through to mortgages, which instead have climbed during the past month and are again hovering close to 7%.",
      "That's because mortgage rates are based on several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond. The latter surged after Trump's November 5 electoral victory on concerns that his policies, including stiff tariffs on U.S. imports, big tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants could drive up inflation.",
      "A key question for housing",
      "Housing affordability is viewed as a top problem within the U.S. by Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, according to a May\u00a0poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The difficulty of affording a home, as well as the impact of rising rents, are issues that colored how voters viewed the economy leading into the election, with the high cost of living top of mind for many.",
      "\"Going forward, the key question is: Are some of the Trump proposals inflationary or non-inflationary?\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One alarming part is tariffs \u2014 that means imported products will be more expensive, and it could take time for domestic production to ramp up.\"",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods. Those costs could boost the U.S. inflation rate by almost 1 percentage point, according to a new Goldman Sachs estimate. Higher inflation in turn could lead the Fed to slow or even pause its rate cuts \u2013 another blow to Americans hoping for lower borrowing costs.",
      "Where will mortgage rates go in 2025?",
      "To be sure, forecasting mortgage rates is difficult, given the number of factors that influence them. Yet based on Trump's stated economic plans, Yun said he thinks the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will bounce around between 6% and 7% for the next year, and could stick around 6.5% for much of 2025.",
      "But, he added, there's a risk mortgage rates could inch even higher if Trump's policies prove more inflationary than expected. Higher mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars in monthly costs for borrowers.",
      "Another issue is whether Trump's policies could widen the federal deficit, which impacts borrowing as well as the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that Trump's proposals would increase the federal budget deficit by $7.75 trillion over the next decade.",
      "To pay interest on that debt, the government would likely have to issue more bonds, like 10-year Treasurys. That could lead investors to demand higher yields, or the return they receive for investing in the bonds. As those yields rise, that would push mortgage rates higher.",
      "\"In the first Trump presidency, the average mortgage rate was about 4% to 5%,\" Yun said, adding, \"We won't get back to that 4% to 5% of that first Trump presidency.\"",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Most Americans report that housing in their communities has become less affordable during the past year, a trend they don't see improving, the Bipartisan Policy Center found.",
      "The median sale price of U.S. homes has dropped slightly during the past year, dipping to about $420,000 in the third quarter from $435,000 a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But that's also considerably higher than the median sale price of $329,000 at the start of 2020, just prior to the pandemic.",
      "The double whammy of high home costs and mortgage rates is pricing many buyers out of the market. The share of first-time home buyers dropped to 24% in 2024, the lowest since 1981, when the National Association of Realtors started tracking the metric. Prior to 2008, the share of first-time buyers had historically been 40%.",
      "That's a problem for would-be homebuyers \u2014 as well as the nation's overall economic health \u2014 because homeownership is a key to building personal wealth. People who delay buying a home have fewer years to grow their assets, which can in turn crimp their ability to build a nest egg for their later years.",
      "The difference in wealth between homeowners and renters is stark: Homeowners had a median net worth of $396,200 in 2022, compared with $10,400 for renters and other non-homeowners, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "While mortgage rates might not see much relief in 2025, home prices are likely to remain stable, Yun predicted.",
      "\"The American way is to buy a home,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a little smaller, or not perfectly ideal, but then trade up to the next home \u2014 in terms of buying rather than delaying, the data shows that homeowners build wealth, while renters are spinning their wheels.\"",

    "summary": "Millions of Americans would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a rule the Biden administration has proposed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",

      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills.

    "summary": "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki talks to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King about the company's recent struggles, welcoming employee feedback and her vision for the future of the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company.",
    "story": [
      "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki knows the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company has been in \"the eye of the storm\" recently, but she said she's confident that the company is still viable and believes it will be \"growing and thriving\" a year from now.",
      "\"I believe in the company. I believe in the long-term mission. But I believe it's essential for us to restructure,\" Wojcicki told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview.",
      "Wojcicki acknowledged recent headlines about the California-based company's struggles, including a data security incident in late 2023, a full board resignation in September, and laying off 40% of the company's workforce in November. In a public letter, the seven board members said it was \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"",
      "The announcement came as a surprise to Wojcicki, saying that she doesn't have \"great insights into what the strategic differences were\" and that \"there was not an overt disagreement.\" Wojcicki has recently said she intends to take the company private and isn't open to considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "\"I will make [mistakes], and I will learn from them\"",
      "Former 23andMe employees were critical of Wojcicki's management style in an October interview with Fortune Magazine \u2013 with one calling her \"outwardly charming, but stubborn and controlling behind the scenes.\"",
      "\"I love getting feedback. Like, one of my favorite things\u2026\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she encourages everyone to voice their opinions and share suggestions.",
      "\"At the heart of what 23andMe does\u2026we're about consumer empowerment and research. Okay.\u00a0 So help me navigate because this has never been done before. So I love getting feedback for all those reasons because it has never been done before,\" Wojcicki explained. \"We're doing all kinds of things for the first time. So we will make mistakes. 100% admit all of that. But\u2026my commitment to the world has always been I will always learn from my mistakes. I will make them, and I will learn from them, and we will be better going forward.\"",
      "Wojcicki sent \"CBS Mornings\" emails she says the company received in support of 23andMe, including one from 70-year-old Rebecca Jones who thanked the company for helping her learn about her increased risk for Alzheimer's. Wojcicki said stories like these show the company provides real value.",
      "When asked by \"CBS Mornings\" if she was concerned about her data following the 2023 security incident at the company, Jones said, \"I have to have some level of confidence in the integrity of 23andMe, like I trust my physician. I have to trust that they are going to safeguard it. Of course I'm concerned and am watching it and will see if there are any steps I should take. I downloaded my data and all of that.\"",
      "Wojcicki's future plans for 23andMe",
      "23andMe's stock has dropped around 98% since 2021, when it went public. The company, which was once valued at $6 billion, now has a market cap of around $80 million. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a net loss of $59.1 million.",
      "King asked, \"How does a company survive when it's lost 98% of its value though?\"",
      "\"I think market cap and reality of a company are always two different realities,\" Wojcicki said. \"We absolutely are in a situation where we're figuring out cash burn and we're looking at all the ways that we're gonna drive revenue growth.\"",
      "To help boost revenue, Wojcicki said the company is focusing on its subscription service, where members can get more insights into their health. With a premium membership, customers get health and ancestry kits, discover things like their historical matches, receive new research reports on health findings - such as new breast cancer variants - and more.",
      "\"People did 23andMe, and they loved it. And we see over 50% of our customers coming back on a quarterly basis, so they're engaged,\" said Wojcicki, adding that it shows \"they want more.\"",
      "Wojcicki said the recent layoffs, which affected more than 200 employees, were also an attempt to help slash costs.",
      "\"The focus right now is 100% on making 23andMe sustainable. And I will not be taking on research initiatives at our own cost anymore. So we will be focusing on \u2013 you know, the consumer business, the subscription, and research partnerships. And I absolutely think, like, 23andMe will, you know, turn a point at some point of being profitable,\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she's confident that in 2025, the company will be \"growing and thriving.\" In five years, it \"will transform health care,\" she told King.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 06:59:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The cartel allegedly uses fishing boats to smuggle drugs and migrants \u2014 and catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species.",
    "story": [
      "For years, U.S. authorities and fishermen have been complaining about illegal fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, and now it's been revealed who is behind the lucrative trade: a Mexican drug cartel.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against members of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.",
      "While commercial fishing and drug cartels may seem like an unlikely combination, it makes perfect sense for a criminal organization.",
      "The department says the cartel uses fishing boats to facilitate drug and migrant smuggling; along the way, the boats catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species. The boats often launch from Playa Bagdad, east of Matamoros, on the Gulf coast.",
      "\"The Gulf Cartel engages in the illicit trade of red snapper and shark species through 'lancha' operations based out of Playa Bagdad,\" the department said. \"Apart from their use for IUU (illegal, unregulated or unreported) fishing in U.S. waters, lanchas are also used to move illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.\"",
      "To add insult to injury, these Mexican boats, often based out of Playa Bagdad, sell their catch in Mexican border cities, where they are sometimes shipped into Texas for resale in the U.S. market.",
      "This occurs while U.S. fishermen had to respect strict seasonal limits or closures designed to protect fish populations.",
      "\"As the fishing of red snapper and shark species is under strict limits in the United States, and therefore those species are more abundant in U.S. waters, Mexican fishermen cross into U.S. waters to fish via these lanchas,\" the department said.",
      "\"They then bring their catch back to lancha camps into Mexico, where the product is ultimately sold and, oftentimes, exported into the United States,\" it continued. \"This activity earns millions a year for lancha camps. In addition, it also leads to the death of other marine species that are inadvertently caught\" on the long lines of baited hooks the boats use.",
      "The Treasury announced Tuesday it was designating five individuals linked to the cartel for illegal fishing -- Ildelfonso Carrillo Sapien (a.k.a. \"El Chivo\"), Raul Decuir Garcia (a.k.a. \"La Burra\"), Ismael Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"El Comandante\"), Omar Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"Samorano\"), and Francisco Javier Sierra Angulo (a.k.a. \"El Borrado\").",
      "History of illegal fishing",
      "This isn't the first time cartels have been involved in illegal fishing in Mexico. Experts say other drug cartels are involved in the prohibited gillnet fishing for totoaba in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, threatening the world's most endangered porpoise, the vaquita marina.",
      "Those designated under Tuesday's sanctions - which block any of their U.S. assets - include Gulf cartel local bosses in Playa Bagdad, as well as two owners of fishing camps there.",
      "The illegal fishing problem became so severe that in 2022, the U.S. government prohibited Mexican fishing vessels from entering U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico, arguing the Mexican government had not done enough to prevent its boats from illegally fishing in U.S. waters.",
      "Mexican fishing boats in the Gulf \"are prohibited from entering U.S. ports, will be denied port access and services,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a report in 2022. According to a Sept. 10, 2024 NOAA bulletin, those restrictions remain in place.",
      "Small Mexican boats frequently use prohibited long lines or nets to haul in snapper in U.S. waters, which can harm other marine life, such as sharks.",
      "NOAA said in a previous report that the U.S. Coast Guard apprehended dozens of Mexican boats in the Gulf, including repeat offenders who had been interdicted multiple times since 2014.",
      "It noted the United States imported nearly five tons of fresh and frozen snapper from Mexico in 2018, raising concerns that \"these imports may have included fish harvested illegally in U.S. waters.\"",
      "U.S. targeting cartels recently",
      "In recent months, the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on cartels for a variety of reasons -- from drug trafficking to fuel theft to time share scams.",
      "In October, the U.S. sanctioned senior members of the armed wing of a Mexican drug cartel that operates on border territories in and around Chihuahua, Mexico. The cartel has also been linked to the 2019 ambush that\u00a0killed nine Americans\u00a0in Mexico.",
      "In September, the U.S. sanctioned a\u00a0man known as \"The Tank\"\u00a0who allegedly leads the fuel theft arm of Mexico's hyper-violent\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel.",
      "In July, the U.S. imposed sanctions on a group of Mexican accountants and firms allegedly linked to a\u00a0timeshare fraud\u00a0ring run by the Jalisco cartel in a multi-million dollar scheme targeting Americans.",
      "The month before that, U.S. officials announced economic sanctions against eight targets affiliated with a Mexican drug cartel, La Nueva Familia Michoacana, accused of fentanyl trafficking and human smuggling. Among the leaders targeted was an alleged assassin named Uriel Tabares Martinez.\u00a0 According to the Treasury Department, he is known as \"El Medico\" (\"The Doctor\") for the violent and surgical manner in which he\u00a0tortures\u00a0and kills those who cross the high-ranking members of the cartel.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 20:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is proposing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is pledging to enact stiff import duties as soon as he's inaugurated in January. For Trump, these new levies would both supercharge the\u00a0trade policies\u00a0pursued during his first administration and, more broadly, help the U.S. achieve key economic and social goals.",
      "On his Truth Social site Monday evening, Trump unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on January 20, his inauguration day. The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "Trump's penchant for protectionist trade policies is a source of concern for many economists and Wall Street analysts, who worry new tariffs and retaliatory measures by U.S. trade partners could slow economic growth, spur inflation and trigger a trade war.",
      "But Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent, have argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that the upside could far outweigh any negatives.",
      "\"But tariffs are two things if you look at it,\" Trump said in October in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "Here are four ways Trump says tariffs will help with the U.S., along with what experts say.",
      "Protect U.S. manufacturing",
      "Trump believes that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help protect U.S. businesses at a time when domestic manufacturing jobs have fallen far from their peak in 1979.",
      "In some instances, the tariffs that Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal, with the Brookings Institution noting there's some evidence that jobs in specific industries may have received a boost. For instance, tariffs on imported washing machines may have created 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other manufacturers, according to the centrist think tank.",
      "But that ignores the broader impact of Trump's first-term tariffs on U.S. manufacturing, with the Federal Reserve finding\u00a0that U.S. manufacturers ended up facing higher costs for raw materials they imported, as well as from retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers, although a range of factors could account for that decline.",
      "\"[O]ur results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,\" the Fed researchers noted.",
      "Bring new companies to the U.S.",
      "Trump also contends that broad-based tariffs will convince some foreign manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. as a way to avoid the import duties.",
      "\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,\" Trump told Bloomberg's Micklethwait.",
      "Although such a shift is possible, Micklethwait said such changes would \"take many, many years.\" (Trump disputed that, saying companies would \"come right away.\") Experts note that many factors beyond tariffs affect where companies decide to operate, including supply chains, taxes, shipping costs, and labor and regulatory policies.",
      "Already, some businesses are anticipating the impact of tariffs by shifting their manufacturing locations, but that may not be guaranteed to benefit the U.S. For instance, shoemaker Steve Madden said if Trump places new tariffs on Chinese imports, it will shift manufacturing away from China and toward nations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Deliver billions in new federal revenue",
      "Trump has also touted tariffs as a way to generate new federal revenue that can offset his proposed tax cuts. During his first administration, his tariffs \u2014 more limited than his current proposals \u2014 generated $80 billion in revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "If Trump institutes a 10% tariff on all imports, as he proposed during his campaign, the federal government would reap $2 trillion from 2025 through 2034,\u00a0estimates\u00a0the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese imports, would generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year. Overall, 43% of U.S. imports come from Mexico (15.4%), Canada (13.6%),and China (13.9%).",
      "However, that revenue would largely be paid by U.S. consumers and businesses, experts say. That's because tariffs are not paid by the countries that export to the U.S., as Trump maintains, but rather by U.S. importers.",
      "In other words, companies like Walmart would be faced with the decision of whether to swallow the higher costs of imports, or passing those on to consumers, Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.",
      "\"If the costs are passed on, then customers face a choice: continue buying the (now more expensive) import or switch to buying a domestic alternative (which will cost more than the import pre-tariff),\" she noted.",
      "Trump's tariffs could cost the typical U.S. family an additional $2,600 a year due to importers and manufacturers passing the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to an August analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigration",
      "Trump also sees the threat of new tariffs as a way to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, citing people \"pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\" The tariffs would remain \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\" he added.",
      "Much of the fentanyl within the U.S.\u00a0is smuggled from Mexico. During President Biden's term, border seizures of the drug rose sharply, with U.S. officials tallying about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, versus 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "While it's possible that Canada, Mexico and China could increase enforcement against drug smuggling or immigration to avoid Trump's tariffs, it's unclear whether such a threat along would achieve those goals. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own and described illegal drugs as a U.S. problem, while indicating a willingness to discuss the issues with Trump.",
      "The flow of drugs into the U.S. \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society,\" she said.",

      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said Tuesday that personal electronics could become more expensive if President-elect Donald Trump carries out his threat to slap new tariffs on foreign goods, as large retailers scramble to assess the potential impact of the proposed levies on their business.",
      "The warning came one day after Trump said he would impose a\u00a0new round of tariffs\u00a0on Mexico, Canada and China on his first day in office. Before the Nov. 5 election, he had proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, arguing the such levies protect domestic manufacturers and encourage American companies to create jobs at home.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"These are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful,\" she added.",

      "Best Buy could try to partly offset the impact of new tariffs by importing more goods ahead of levies taking effect in 2025, as well as working with vendors to source products from countries other than China, Barry said during the call. Roughly 60% of the goods Best Buy sells are imported from China.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:30:16 -0500",
    "summary": "John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., talks about the company's decision to scale back its DEI policies.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart's decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies nationwide is designed to \"ensure every customer, every associate\" feels welcome and like they belong, according to John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S.",
      "\"Like many companies all across the United States, we've been on a journey and we continue to be on a journey. And what we're trying to do is to ensure that every customer, every associate feels welcome here to shop. And to feel like they belong,\" Furner said in response to questions about the DEI policy decision in an exclusive interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday after\u00a0Wall Street Journal earlier reported\u00a0on them, represent the end of a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd, as well as the retailer's decision to phase out the term DEI. Walmart will also no longer give priority treatment to suppliers based on race or gender diversity and will halt sellers from listing some transgender-related or themed items on the website.",
      "Furner said Walmart is undergoing the changes to help foster inclusion.",
      "\"We're going to continue to make the best decisions we can that makes everyone \u2013 our customers, our associates \u2013 feel like this is an environment they can shop in and thrive in,\" he said.",
      "Even so, Walmart's decision comes amid growing pressure from conservatives to halt corporate DEI policies, which ramped up after the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023\u00a0ending affirmative action in college admissions. Some conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace DEI initiatives as well as hiring practices that give boosts to historically marginalized groups.",
      "Other corporations that have recently backed away from DEI policies include\u00a0Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply\u00a0and\u00a0Harley-Davidson.",
      "When asked if diversity among suppliers remains important to Walmart, Furner turned the focus to small businesses and small suppliers.",
      "\"We'll continue to do the things we can do to ensure small suppliers have a path to be successful,\" he said, noting that Walmart started in 1962 as a single store in Rogers, Arkansas.",
      "Walmart is also committed to selling American-made goods, which make up about two-thirds of what the company sells, Furner said, adding, \"We're going to continue to lean into ensuring that we provide the very best pathways for small businesses, our supplies to be successful here in the store.\"",
      "How Walmart's preparing for Trump's proposed tariffs",
      "Walmart will be ready for President-elect Donald Trump's new trade policies, as the retailer's products are mostly made within the U.S., Furner said. Even so, he acknowledged customers may see some impact on prices.",
      "On Monday, Trump doubled down on his campaign promise, threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on imported goods from Mexico, Canada and China \u2013 America's top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data \u2013 \u00a0as one of his \"many first Executive Orders.\"",
      "Trump said he plans to add a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which he described as part of his crackdown on drugs and immigration. He said the tariffs would stand \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! \"",
      "\"We'll adjust to any environment. We've been in an environment with tariffs now for the last seven years,\" Furner said, adding that they have a team of people who are responsible for managing changes in trade policy.",
      "Furner said Walmart will do everything possible \u2013 between the suppliers and supply chain \u2013\u00a0 to keep prices low and help people save money.",
      "\"We're going to focus on products and values,\" Furner said, noting the company continues to monitor and evaluate the incoming Trump administration's potential plans.",

      "That's according to recently released data that outlines the heavy financial burden on the nearly 14 million American parents who rely on paid caregivers to look after their children. Families spent as much as $15,600 per year on full-day care per child in 2022 (the latest year for which data is available), although those with infants can face costs as high as $31,544 annually, according\u00a0to\u00a0a recently updated\u00a0database\u00a0compiled by the Department of Labor.",
      "That exceeds the U.S. median rent of $15,216 that same year, while some families are spending as much as almost 30% of their annual earnings on child care, the agency noted. Overall, the cost of child care has soared more than 50% over the last decade.",
      "\"Having a young child in this country is a cause of poverty. It's not correlated with it, it is a cause of poverty,\" Elliot Haspel, the author of the nonfiction book \"Crawling Behind, America's Childcare Crisis and How to Fix It,\"\u00a0told the Harvard Graduate School of Education in October.",
      "Haspel noted that the demographic group most likely to face eviction \"are Black children under the age of five. And a lot of this is a child care story. It isn't a housing story.\"",
      "Families with infants typically pay more for child care, as well as those living in more populous counties\u00a0or using center-based, instead of home-based, care, the Labor Department found.",

      "The cost burden of paying for child care can exceed a typical family's annual housing costs, and even cost more than in-state tuition at public universities, other research has found.",
      "In some U.S. states, child care expenses are consuming\u00a0more than a quarter of an average household's total income, with a typical family spending $700 a month on the service, Bank of America found in a 2023 report.",
      "In 2022, the cost of child care for two kids in a center exceeded the typical annual mortgage payment in 41 states and the District of Columbia, while infant care costs at a center surpassed in-state tuition at a public university in 32 states and D.C., according to the advocacy organization First Focus.",
      "While consuming a large chunk of many families' income, child care workers are generally poorly paid. As of May 2023, wages averaged $15.42 an hour, or just over $32,000 a year, according\u00a0to\u00a0federal data. Overall, the nation's child care workforce is among the lowest 5% paid of all occupations, noted Haspel.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic worsened an existing\u00a0shortage of child care workers\u00a0as thousands left the industry in favor of higher-paid work. More than half of child care providers surveyed in 2024 said their programs were under-enrolled relative to their current capacity for reasons including staffing shortages, First Focus found.",
      "The infusion of $24 billion in federal pandemic aid to child care providers, along with $14 billion more to help states address the issues, stopped costs from rising even further, the Labor Department said.",

    "summary": "Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and that drugs were a U.S. problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",

    "summary": "Most Americans are forced to retire earlier than they had expected, often disrupting their financial planning.",
    "story": [
      "The typical American retires far earlier than he or she expects to, and it's often not by choice, according to new research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",
      "The median retirement age in the U.S. is 62, with nearly six in 10 retirees telling the research firm that they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned. Almost half of those people said the reason came down to health issues, such as physical limitations or disability. Losing a job or an organizational change at their employer were among the other reasons people stopped working before they planned to retire.",
      "\"Financially precarious\"",
      "The findings underscore the fragility of retirement in the U.S., with older Americans often finding themselves retired before they're financially ready to call it quits. And with many people outliving earlier generations \u2014 the typical respondent told Transamerica they believe they'll live to age 90 \u2014 they're also facing the prospect of supporting themselves financially for several decades in retirement, which can easily stretch or even exhaust their savings.",
      "\"Many of them are financially precarious \u2014 if they were to have some sort of major financial shock or their health would decline and needed long-term care, they would have a hard time affording it,\" Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The research backs up previous research about the typical retirement age, with the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute finding earlier this year that the median retirement age for Americans is 62. That underscores a gap between retirement plans and reality, with business leaders and policy experts often urging Americans to work longer so they can save more for their old age \u2014 a strategy that often doesn't unfold as envisioned.",
      "Retirees forced to leave their jobs earlier than planned is a \"cautionary tale for people currently in the workforce,\" Collinson said.",
      "People should actively maintain their health and keep their skills up to date, while also educating themselves about retirement and financial planning, as well as socking away savings, she noted.",
      "Why Americans claim Social Security early",
      "Retiring before a person expects may explain why millions of Americans claim Social Security before they reach their \"full retirement age,\" or the age at which they are entitled to their full benefits.",
      "Retirement experts generally urge Americans to hold off on claiming Social Security as long as possible because of the financial benefits of waiting. Workers can file for the retirement benefit as early as age 62, but the tradeoff is a roughly 30%\u00a0reduction\u00a0in their monthly checks compared with waiting until full retirement age, which is either 66 or 67 depending on one's birth year.",
      "But the median age when Americans claim Social Security benefits is 63, Transamerica found in its survey of more than 2,400 retirees. That means many older Americans are locking themselves into permanently lower monthly checks throughout their retirement.",
      "On the flip side, waiting until age 70 to collect Social Security \u2014 the maximum age to claim benefits \u2014 provides a boost of more than 30% to one's monthly benefits. Despite that incentive, Transamerica found that only 4% of retirees wait until 70 to file for their benefits.",
      "\"One of the most important things they can do is fully understand their benefits, and if they have any options to stretch out those benefits,\" Collinson said. \"If it's a spousal situation, maybe if they need the income, one claims first and the other later, or if they can jump back in the workforce and hit the pause button on Social Security and get more income.\"",
      "Another reason for claiming Social Security early is likely that many retirees may not have enough money put away in a retirement fund to keep them afloat. Only about half of U.S. retirees participated in a 401(k) or similar plan throughout their working careers, while more than one in four said their employer never offered retirement benefits while they worked, Transamerica found.",
      "About 6 in 10 retirees cited Social Security as their primary source of income, underscoring the importance of the program for older Americans. By comparison, only about 1 in 10 said retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs would be their main source of income.",
      "Challenged but happy",
      "Despite the challenges, many retirees are sanguine about stepping back from work, the study found. Almost 9 in 10 described themselves as being generally happy and having close relationships with family and friends.",
      "\"One of the things that stands out is retirees are really enjoying their time in retirement, which I think bodes well for all of us,\" Collinson said. \"They've made some adjustments, especially to their financial situation, and overall they are doing well.\"",
      "Americans \"dream of retirement,\" she added. \"Retirement is more about freedom and the ability to spend their time as they want to, rather than it is financial freedom specifically.\"",

      "Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0flew to Florida to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Canada's CBC News reported. The meeting comes in the wake of Trump's threat to impose tariffs on goods coming from Canada.",
      "Trudeau was expected to dine with Trump at Mar-a-largo Friday night, according to senior sources who spoke to CBC News on condition they not be named due to the sensitivity of the trip. The sources said the meeting was pushed for by Canadian officials, the Canadian broadcaster said.",
      "Trudeau's plane landed at Palm Beach International Airport at about 5:30 p.m. local time. A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday from Mar-a-Lago. The Trump transition team did not comment on the meeting when reached by CBS News.",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives, a person familiar with the dinner plans who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press.",
      "Also attending the dinner, the person told the AP, were Republican Senator-elect David McCormick of Pennsylvania, and his wife Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.",
      "The meeting comes after Trudeau earlier Friday cautioned that if Trump follows through on this threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, he would be raising prices for Americans and hurting American businesses.",
      "Trump\u00a0has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products\u00a0entering the U.S.\u00a0from Canada and\u00a0Mexico\u00a0as one of his first executive orders.",
      "\"It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it,\" Trudeau said to reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada earlier Friday.",
      "\"Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,\" he added.",
      "Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries, but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products, including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.",
      "Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump's team negotiated during his first term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a \"win-win\" for both countries.",
      "\"We can work together as we did previously,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Although Trump once called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest\" during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the Group of Seven countries to visit Trump since the Nov. 4 election.",
      "Trump aide Corey Lewandowski, speaking on Fox News Friday night, said that he was \"certain\" that Trudeau \"is going to come down and have a conversation with the president and say, 'Sir, what can we do to keep this border open, what can we do to keep goods flowing? We know we have problems we are here to fix it.'\"",
      "Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but they are ready to make new investments in border security.",
      "\"We're going to work together to meet some of the concerns,\" Trudeau said. \"But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that\u00a0a tariff war with the United States\u00a0will be averted. Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with her and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 17:05:04 -0500",
    "summary": "LGBTQ voters were among the only demographic groups that did not move more toward Trump in the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Lucian Holness woke up to a daunting reality on Nov. 6. Acute stress led the mix of emotions that struck the transgender marketing manager as they learned President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 never a reliable ally to the LGBTQ community and an increasingly hostile figure for transgender Americans \u2014 had won a second term in the White House.",
      "\"I went into this election fully expecting Trump to win,\" said Holness, who lives in New Jersey and began to medically transition during the pandemic, an experience they called \"liberating\" and \"amazing\" after a long time spent \"feeling like something was wrong.\"",
      "Assuming Trump would take the presidency again was a self-preservation tactic, Holness told CBS News but it did not necessarily soften the blow.",
      "\"Maybe I thought it would be a closer race than it was. And just seeing how many states we were losing, the immense way that we lost \u2026 that really destroyed me,\" Holness said. \"And for several days after I had no hope in humanity.\"",
      "After the election, commentators and analysts suggested Trump's decisive victory against Vice President Kamala Harris was broad evidence of a thirst for economic change across\u00a0the bright red map of the country. To win, he had punctured the Democratic \"blue wall\" and flipped all seven battleground states, with CBS News exit polls\u00a0indicating he had received support from more of the electorate than ever.",
      "LGBTQ voters were among the only demographic groups that did not stray toward Trump when they cast ballots in the presidential contest this year. Black women also overwhelmingly backed Harris at the polls.",
      "\"Black voters and queer voters understood the assignment in this election, and our assignment was to defeat the great threat to our safety and freedom that Trump poses, so that we can fight for what all of us need to be safe and free,\" said Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, the executive director of GLSEN, an LGBTQ advocacy group focused on supporting and educating young people. Willingham-Jaggers identifies as nonbinary and queer.",
      "The LGBTQ community has historically voted Democrat but unlike most other demographic trends this year, LGBTQ support for the party's presidential nominee rose substantially from 2020. CBS News' national exit polls showed 86% of people who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender voted for Harris, while just 13% voted for Trump. Echoing most Harris voters, a majority of LGBTQ\u00a0 people said they feared what could happen during another Trump presidency.",
      "People in the LGBTQ community told CBS News they see the recurrence of Trumpism as a tangible affront to their basic human rights. The implications feel particularly urgent to transgender Americans, whom the president-elect and his affiliates categorically targeted throughout the campaign.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these individuals are sadly misinformed,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition team, in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump campaigned on being a president for ALL Americans and will unify our country through great success.\"",
      "\"I don't feel welcome here\"",
      "The Trump campaign ran advertisements attacking trans people for months ahead of Election Day, in a move that likely cost at least tens of millions of dollars. Criticized for scapegoating, one TV ad bore a tagline interpreted as an attempt to sow division: \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"",
      "The advocacy organization GLAAD\u00a0counted 225 defined attacks on the LGBTQ community by Trump during his first White House term and latest presidential campaign, in terms of policy decisions and rhetoric, which transgender Americans and others who are LGBTQ told CBS News is damaging on its own. The Trevor Project saw a 700% spike in crisis calls throughout the day after the election, and research from the organization found recent politics negatively impacted the well-being of 90% of LGBTQ young people, while anti-trans state legislation in the last year drove up suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth by as much as 72%.",
      "\"I don't feel welcome here,\" said Holness.",
      "Although New Jersey is a sanctuary state for LGBTQ rights, and Gov. Phil Murphy last year declared it a safe haven for transgender and nonbinary people seeking gender-affirming care, Holness is still concerned about the ways in which a second Trump administration and Republican Congress could potentially work to break down that refuge.",
      "\"What people think being trans is, versus the actual experience of being trans, are so vastly different. And if people would just listen to us, I think they'd be surprised how much we are the same as them,\" Holness told CBS News. \"It took me a while to take Trump seriously, but after seeing the rise in trans hate crimes, and the rise in anti-trans legislation, the bounty out on trans people just for existing, you know, it's become really scary.\"",
      "Trump's anti-LGBTQ and specifically anti-trans positions stretch back to his first term in the White House, when he scrubbed federal agency sites of representation and proceeded to roll back protections for LGBTQ\u00a0 people, among other policy decisions that clamped down on their abilities to live and work freely.",
      "But vitriol toward the community became integral to Trump's politics and his overall public brand during the latest presidential bid.",
      "Health care access under siege",
      "As Trump doubled down on anti-trans rhetoric in his speeches, he backed conservative proposals to restrict access to healthcare for transgender people and punish doctors who give minors gender-affirming care.",
      "\"The number one issue, of the many that the trans people I spoke with are worried about, is access to the health care that we need to live. This is not an abstraction. It is not a culture war. It is not a political football,\" said Gillian Brandstetter, a communications strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It is very much a problem of material need. Can we access hormone therapy? Can we maintain our relationship with our doctors? Can we maintain our insurance coverage?\"",
      "Trump pushed during his last administration to federally redefine gender along binary lines that would exclude transgender identities, effectively denying trans people legal recognition and upholding an outdated characterization of \"biological sex,\" even though\u00a0the medical field has expanded its view of the spectrum of gender identity. Renewed promises made by the campaign this year are fueling panic that he will attempt to implement it nationally again.",
      "Ryan Lyman, a trans college student in New York City who volunteered for the Harris campaign and said he has \"passing privilege\" after beginning hormone therapy at 17 and undergoing top surgery, told CBS News trans people elsewhere in the country are preparing for the worst case scenario. \"Passing privilege\" in this instance means Lyman may avoid some of the prejudice other transgender people face if he is publicly perceived to be a cisgender man.",
      "\"I've seen a lot of people on the Internet lately who are going back to their assigned gender presentation,\" Lyman said. \"There is a part of the community that lives in the Deep South, in red states, who have to go stealth for their own safety. And I do not judge them at all.\"",
      "A decision that could potentially work to protect certain trans rights before Inauguration Day is the outcome of United States v. Skrmetti, a landmark case set to go before the Supreme Court in December where justices will hear a challenge to Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender people younger than 18. The decision could have wide-ranging impacts at a time where almost half of U.S. states have enacted laws to limit access to various aspects of gender-affirming care, like hormones, puberty-blocking drugs or surgery.",
      "An uncertain future",
      "Many LGBTQ people are anxious about how Trump could alter fundamental parts of their lives, out in the world and at home.",
      "A growing number of transgender social media users have now spent the better part of a month sharing guidance on how to update licenses, passports and other legal documents to reflect their names and pronouns. LGBTQ couples told CBS News they are having conversations about whether they should rush to get married before January's inauguration and what family planning might look like once Trump is sworn in.",
      "Lee Robinson, a comedian moving from Denver to New York City, said they were already considering some of those big questions within days of the election. They had started to discuss their options with their girlfriend, too.",
      "\"It's not just marriage, it's parentage and fertility stuff, and queer adoption,\" said Robinson. \"It just totally throws off our ability to plan for our futures when this kind of thing happens.\"",
      "Everyone who spoke to CBS News for this story shared concerns about losing discrimination protections under a second Trump administration. They also wonder what it would mean if the Supreme Court's 2015 marriage equality ruling came under review and marriage rights, like abortion rights, were returned to the states.",
      "An updated policy rundown on Trump's 2024 campaign website called Agenda 47 offers a blueprint of his \"20 Core Promises To Make America Great Again.\" Among the items on that list, Trump pledges to \"keep men out of women's sports\" and cut federal funding for schools \"pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\"",
      "These items echo GOP state lawmakers and government leaders who have sought to bar trans youth from athletic teams that align with their gender identities and ban\u00a0LGBTQ and racial identity-focused\u00a0lesson plans and books from school curriculum. The First Amendment's freedom of speech and religion clauses have been used in high-profile court cases to justify anti-LGBTQ discrimination.",
      "They are not just concepts. Anti-LGBTQ doctrines embraced at Republican rallies have in recent years been codified across the country, keeping transgender children off of sports teams and away from bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. In Florida, laws have been passed to take transgender-focused curriculum out of schools; a legal settlement earlier this year clarified that students and teachers would be able to discuss gender identity as long as it's not part of the curriculum.",
      "Capitol Hill is not immune, as Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat set to become the first openly transgender person in Congress, faced a swift Republican-led attempt after her trailblazing win to restrict her restroom use\u00a0in the Capitol Complex.",
      "\"It's dehumanizing people,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and CEO of the advocacy organization GLAAD. \"They want to treat us as second-class citizens, question our dignity and respect.\"",
      "Ellis said measurable repercussions in the balance, like medical coverage and equality under the law, are joined by intangible consequences that could trickle down generations.",
      "\"I think of my kids, as my wife and I's marriage is under fire, but our neighbors' marriage isn't under fire. It's awful when you think about that,\" she shared. \"So, my kids, in their understanding, see us as less than the family next door because they have two moms versus a mom and a dad, or a single mom. I just think all these are their culture wars, not ours.\"",
      "Project 2025",
      "Experts often attribute the intensification of Trump's anti-LGBTQ platform to his ties with right-wing religious groups like the Heritage Foundation, an organization with a long history of espousing anti-LGBTQ laws that helmed the presidential transition proposal Project 2025.",
      "Project 2025 is a 900-page policy handbook developed by a team linked to more than 100 conservative groups, to which Trump had denied connections, though he is hiring several of its architects to fill key staff positions in the next administration. The book calls for an overhaul of the federal government to \"restore family as the centerpiece of American life.\" Its socio-political vision for how to do that, introduced on the first page of Project 2025, directs government officials to reject transgender people and LGBTQ identities across the board.",
      "\"The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors. This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\"SOGI\"), diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\"), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists,\" the document states, at the outset of its opening chapter.",
      "Although Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, even going so far as to call some of its proposals \"abysmal,\" the blueprint is compatible with the Republican Party agenda. But at the same time, Trump also plans to nominate Scott Bessent to be treasury secretary. He's a billionaire and former George Soros hedge fund manager and if confirmed, he'd be the first openly gay person to serve in this role.",
      "\"We should absolutely take Trump at his word,\" said Willingham-Jaggers, of GLSEN. \"We should take Project 2025 at its word. We should expect a full court press to get everything outlined in Project 2025, created into policy and enacted as the starting point, not the end point, as the starting point. That's part one. That's what I'm concerned about.\"",

    "summary": "As Donald Trump's second term approaches, Republicans have cited inflated figures on noncitizens with criminal records.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's appointed \"border czar\" Tom Homan has said that he wants to prioritize deporting noncitizens with criminal histories when Trump's second term starts in January.",
      "This follows recent high-profile criminal cases involving undocumented immigrants, including the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley by a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "But in interviews, Homan and other top Republicans have shared contradictory and inflated figures about the overall number of noncitizens who Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials say fall into this category.",
      "In a recent interview with Fox News, Homan said there are \"over 1.5 million convicted criminal aliens in this country with orders for removal who we'll be looking for.\" The Trump transition team has said this number includes some migrants who have crossed into the country illegally, although they are not considered \"convicted criminal aliens.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed in recent weeks that the number of migrants apprehended for committing violent crimes specifically is \"by some counts, as many as 3 or 4 million people.\"",
      "However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided much lower estimates to Congress.",
      "As of July 21, ICE's national docket, which tracks immigrants facing deportation proceedings, listed roughly 660,000 noncitizens with criminal histories, including 436,000 convicted criminals and 227,000 with pending criminal charges.",
      "This includes noncitizens in ICE detention and those not detained by the agency.",
      "There are only estimates of the number of noncitizens currently in the U.S. As of 2022, there were roughly 24.5 million noncitizens \u2014 including at least 11 million unauthorized immigrants and 13.5 million people who are lawful permanent residents or temporary lawful residents, according to estimates by Pew Research Center based on the latest Census data.",
      "By Homan's numbers, around 6% of noncitizens would be convicted criminals. By Johnson's numbers closer to 12% of the noncitizens would be criminals, or as much as 24% of the unauthorized population.",
      "According to ICE's figures closer to 2.6% of the noncitizens in the U.S. have criminal histories.",
      "Response from Trump's transition spokesman",
      "The agency's totals are far below the millions suggested by Homan and Johnson, and ICE's figures remain the most accurate available for tracking noncitizens with criminal histories, according to C. Mario Russell, executive director for the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that also supports policies that safeguard migrant rights.",
      "Johnson's office did not respond to a request for clarification at time of publication.",
      "Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesman, told CBS News that Homan was considering the number of migrants who have crossed illegally into the U.S. who evaded border patrol, sometimes called \"gotaways\" by immigration and border security officials.",
      "\"Tom Homan is right\u2013nearly 2 million 'gotaways' have evaded border patrol under the Biden-Harris wide-open border, which is more than four times the average under President Trump,\" Hughes said.",
      "Border Patrol estimates that roughly 1.7 million migrants have evaded apprehension since the start of fiscal year 2021. However, there is no official data on the number of so-called \"gotaways\" with criminal records.",
      "There were also \"gotaways\" during the Trump administration but the average number during Trump's first three years in office, before immigration fell during COVID-19, was four times lower than the totals in fiscal year 2022 and 2023, according to testimony by Steven A. Camarota, the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies.",
      "In some interviews, Homan has also cited lower figures more in line with ICE data. On Nov. 14, for example, Homan told NewsNation, \"authorities have identified more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions.\"",
      "What ICE's data shows about the number of noncitizens with criminal histories",
      "Noncitizens \u2014 including those with green cards \u2014 can lose their legal right to be in the U.S. after committing a crime. Many of the people ICE tracks remain incarcerated and can be deported only after serving their sentences.",
      "Data suggests many of the 436,000 convicted criminals on this list, including over 13,000 convicted of murder and 62,000 people convicted of assault, have been in the U.S. for years. Non-violent offenders are also on ICE's docket, including more than 125,000 people convicted of or facing traffic offenses.",
      "In 2016, under the Obama administration, there were 368,574 convicted criminals in ICE's non-detained docket, according to data published by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. In June 2021, a few months into the Biden administration, there were 405,786 convicted criminals on the list.",
      "Some criminal noncitizens remain in the U.S. for years because they come from countries that don't accept or limit U.S. deportations, including Cuba, Venezuela, and China. Others are legally protected from deportation under United Nations convention because they face a credible threat of torture if they return to their home countries.",
      "Government statistics indicate that a relatively small fraction of migrants processed by Border Patrol have criminal records in the U.S. or in other countries that share information with American officials.",
      "Additionally, although the data is not exhaustive, available studies suggest that undocumented migrants are incarcerated less frequently than native-born Americans.",

      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Monday, President Biden issued the final two turkey pardons of his term, to Peach and Blossom, sending them to live out the rest of their lives at Minnesota's Farmamerica as poultry ambassadors for agricultural students.",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump spent all but one Thanksgiving of his first term at his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida. President Biden has spent every Thanksgiving during his term with family in Nantucket, Massachusetts as the Biden family has for over 40 years.",

Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin, tapped to be U.N. ambassador and EPA administrator respectively, both said they were targeted, and the NYPD responded to a threat at the home of Howard Lutnick, tapped to be Commerce Secretary.

      "\"Swatting\" is the action of falsely calling emergency services in an effort to send armed police officers to a specific address or target in a threatening way. Bomb threats can represent a form of swatting \u2014 misleading authorities to believe that a serious threat or crime is underway to prompt an urgent response from police.

Mr. Biden wrote in his memoir \"Promise Me, Dad,\" that \"we had some great years in that span, and we had some lousy years, but whatever was happening, whatever bumps and bruises we were suffering, we put it all aside and celebrated Thanksgiving in Nantucket.\"",
      "Jill Biden wrote in her memoir \"Where the Light Enters,\" that the Bidens started going to Nantucket when she and the president started dating.",
      "\"When Thanksgiving rolled around, we knew we wanted to spend it together, but we didn't know where,\" she writes. \"My parents wanted us to join them, his parents wanted us to join them, and even Neilia's parents had extended an invitation. We were touched and grateful, but it was stressful to think about choosing one family gathering over another, so I said to Joe, 'Let's go somewhere, just the four of us.'\"",
      "Jill Biden said that her husband's then-chief of staff suggested Nantucket, which neither of them had ever been, but she said they decided \"it sounded as good as anywhere.\"",
      "\"I packed a cooler with sandwiches and sodas, we loaded the boys into a station wagon and we drove six hours to the Cape,\" she writes. \"On a packed ferryboat to the island, we chugged past beautiful Brant Point Lighthouse and up to the pier. Joe and I took deep breaths of salt-tinged air as we got our first view of the shingled cottages that lined the coast \u2026 That first year, we stayed in one of those cottages, right on the water, paying one hundred dollars for the whole week.\"",
      "Jill Biden writes that Nantucket Thanksgiving became the family tradition for the next four decades. \"With a few exceptions, we've made the trek every year since, creating rituals that would become a key part of our family along the way,\" she writes.",
      "\"Once in Nantucket, we spend hours poking around in the shops, and on the Friday after Thanksgiving, we go to the Brotherhood of Thieves restaurant for lunch. We gather on cobblestoned Main Street on Friday evenings to see Santa Claus, watch the big Christmas tree-lighting ceremony, and sing carols.

They were celebrating their twelfth anniversary at the end of the week, and Hallie had never missed a Thanksgiving. Even the year Beau was stationed in Iraq, she insisted we all keep the tradition and go to Nantucket.\"",
      "\"The holiday trip was a constant in our grandchildren's lives from the time they were aware, and they made it clear how much it meant to them,\" Mr. Biden wrote.",

      "Bidens return to Nantucket",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:17:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Then-candidate Donald Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe.",
    "story": [
      "When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the battleground state.",
      "Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe, a distinction that would unlock access to federal funds. He ultimately won North Carolina by more than 3 points, in part due to continued support from Lumbee voters.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, the promise will be put to the test. He has Republican allies in Congress on the issue, and now the Lumbee, as well as tribal nations across the country, are watching closely to see what comes next.",
      "Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior, but the Lumbee have been trying for many years to circumvent that process by going through Congress. Chairman John Lowery called Interior's application process \"flawed\" and overly lengthy and said it should be up to Congress to right what he calls a historic wrong.",
      "\"It's just crazy that we're sitting here fighting this battle, and I have to tell you that I am real in 2024,\" Lowery said.",
      "Following the presidential election, the Lumbee hope there will be momentum behind their cause, but they face deep-rooted opposition from tribal nations across the country.",
      "There are questions about Trump's next move",
      "Several tribes, including the only one that is federally recognized in North Carolina, argue that if the Lumbee Tribe wants federal acknowledgment, it should go through the formal process in the Department of the Interior. One person familiar with Trump's thinking said the president-elect will require the Lumbee Tribe to do just that, and he won't sign a Lumbee recognition bill. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about Trump's views.",
      "Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said \"no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.\"",
      "Federal recognition is of enormous importance, as it comes with access to resources like healthcare through Indian Health Services and the ability to create a land base such as reservations through the land-to-trust process. But before that happens, a tribal nation has to file a successful application with the Office of Federal Acknowledgement, a department within the Interior.",
      "The Lumbee Tribe has applied for federal recognition, but that petition was denied in 1985 because it \"could not establish the group's descendency either culturally, politically, or genealogically from any tribe which existed historically in the area.\"",
      "In 2016, the Interior reversed a decision barring the Lumbee Tribe from reapplying, but the Lumbee have opted for the congressional route.",
      "Gaining federal recognition through legislation is a rare but not unheard of path. But the Lumbee's approach has stoked a simmering debate in both Indian Country and Congress about Indigenous identity and tribal nationhood.",
      "The Lumbee have received support from members of both parties",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have supported recognizing the Lumbee through legislation, including Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation who campaigned for Trump in North Carolina and backed the legislation.",
      "But perhaps the state-recognized tribe's most ardent ally in Congress is North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "Tillis introduced the\u00a0Lumbee Fairness Act\u00a0last year and has been a vocal supporter of the Lumbee. In interviews with The Associated Press, several tribal leaders, lobbyists, and advocates said they were told by Tillis directly or by his staff that the senator is currently and will continue to block certain bills backed by tribal nations unless the leaders of those tribes support the Lumbee.",
      "One of the bills he's promised to block, according to those interviewed by the AP, is a land transfer that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to return 70 acres of land to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribal nation in Tillis's state. It would allow the tribe to put the land in Monroe County, Tennessee into trust. The plot is part of the tribal nation's homelands and contains the birthplace of Sequoyah.",
      "\"It's appalling to me. It's disgraceful,\" Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Michell Hicks said. He said that Tillis told him earlier this year that he would stop any legislation dealing with the Eastern Band unless Hicks pledged his support.",
      "Hicks is among the tribal leaders who question the validity of the Lumbee's historical claims, and he said that is out of the question. At one point about a century ago, the Lumbee were known as the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and for many years now all three Cherokee tribes \u2014 the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians \u2014 have denounced this and been vocal opponents of granting the Lumbee federal recognition.",
      "Representatives for Tillis declined to comment.",
      "Tillis held up legislation last week that would have allowed for the preservation of the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. While doing so, he singled out the heads of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who have backed the preservation measure, for not supporting his efforts to federally recognize the Lumbee.",
      "\"This is not about you,\" Tillis said to the two tribal nations, who he acknowledged had been trying for a century to preserve the site of the massacre. \"But you need to know that your leadership is playing a game that will ultimately force me to take a position.\"",
      "Tillis suggested it was a \"casino cartel\" in part driven by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an Osage attorney named Wilson Pipestem working for the tribe, that is trying to keep the Lumbee from gaining recognition, which could one day lead to the Lumbee opening their own casinos. Tillis threatened to continue publicly naming tribal leaders and their employees who he felt were standing in the way of his bill.",
      "In a statement to the AP, Pipestem said Tillis should \"apologize to the Tribal leaders for his false allegations and unscrupulous tactics.\"",
      "Lowery acknowledged that Tillis has held up both pieces of legislation, but he said that Tillis has not done so at the direction of the Lumbee.",
      "\"If he's put a hold on the bill it's because he reached out to tribal leaders to see where they stand on his bill, and they apparently have told him that they're not in support,\" Lowery said. \"So, he said 'well, if you can't be supportive of my bill, I can't be supportive of your bill.'\""

      "\"Last night and this morning, several of President Trump's Cabinet nominees and administration appointees were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These attacks ranged from bomb threats to 'swatting.' In response, law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted. President Trump and the entire transition team are grateful for their swift action.\"",
      "Leavitt didn't offer specifics about who was targeted or where, but multiple Trump associates shared that they were targets.",
      "Susie Wiles, Trump's incoming chief of staff, and Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general whom Trump has chosen to be the next U.S. attorney general, were targeted in this wave of attacks, according to a senior law enforcement official. Rep.\u00a0Elise Stefanik, Trump's pick to be the\u00a0U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was targeted with a bomb threat to her New York home, her office said.",

      "\"This morning, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, her husband, and their three year old son were driving home to Saratoga County from Washington for Thanksgiving when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence,\" Stefanik's office said in a statement Wednesday morning. \"New York State, County law enforcement, and U.S. Capitol Police responded immediately with the highest levels of professionalism. We are incredibly appreciative of the extraordinary dedication of law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe 24/7. We want to share our best wishes to the Upstate NY community for a happy and safe Thanksgiving. We are especially grateful to our law enforcement officers and military families who are on duty over the holiday season.\"",
      "The home of Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick to be secretary of commerce who is a transition adviser, was also threatened, according to the New York Police Department. NYPD said a 911 call came in reporting a terrorist bomb threat at his home.",
      "Former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who Trump tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, also said he was targeted.",
      "\"A pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family at our home today was sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message,\" Zeldin\u00a0said in a post on X. \"My family and I were not home at the time and are safe. We are working with law enforcement to learn more as this situation develops. We are thankful for the swift actions taken by local officers to keep our family, neighbors, and local community secure.\"",
      "Brooke Rollins, Trump's pick to be secretary of agriculture, also said a \"threat was issued\" against her home and family, and thanked the Fort Worth, Texas, police department for their help. She said she and her family were unharmed, and returned home quickly.",
      "A White House spokesperson said the president has been briefed on the incidents and \"unequivocally\" condemns threats of political violence.",
      "\"The White House is in touch with federal law enforcement and the president-elect's team, and continues to monitor the situation closely,\" the White House spokesperson said. \"Federal law enforcement's response, alongside state and local authorities, remains ongoing. The president and the administration unequivocally condemn threats of political violence.\"",
      "The FBI said in a statement that it's aware of \"numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees\" and is working with law enforcement partners.",
      "\"We take all potential threats seriously, and as always, encourage members of the public to immediately report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement,\" the agency said.",
      "U.S. Capitol Police didn't address specific reports, but said they work closely with law enforcement in swatting incidents.",
      "\"Anytime a member of Congress is the victim of a 'swatting' incident, we work closely with our local and federal law enforcement partners,\" The U.S. Capitol Police said. \"To protect ongoing investigations and to minimize the risk of copy-cats, we cannot provide more details at this time.\"",

And on Tuesday, the Justice Department said an Arizona man was arrested on Nov. 21 for allegedly making threats against Trump and his family.",

Additionally, the Biden Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union have sued Texas, arguing the law interferes with the federal government's authority over immigration.",
      "Homan on Tuesday vowed to \"help Abbott finish the job he started\" when Trump takes office.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez asked a federal court in New York on Wednesday to throw out his conviction in a sprawling bribery scheme and grant him a new trial after prosecutors disclosed that the jury was inadvertently provided information during deliberations that it should not have been given.",
      "The request from Menendez's lawyers came in response to a letter prosecutors sent to the court on Nov. 13 revealing they had unintentionally loaded onto a laptop given to the jury during deliberations the incorrect versions of nine exhibits. Prosecutors said neither they nor Menendez's lawyers, who inspected the exhibits on the laptop, noticed the error at the time.",
      "Government lawyers told U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein that they did not believe the inclusion of the nine exhibits warranted upsetting Menendez's guilty verdict, in part because \"there is no reasonable likelihood any juror ever saw any of the erroneously less-redacted versions.\" But Menendez's lawyers told Stein in a separate filing that the improper disclosure was a \"serious breach\" by prosecutors and said a new trial was \"unavoidable.\"",
      "The exhibits, they said, \"exposed the jury to a theory of criminality that the government was barred from presenting under the Speech or Debate Clause \u2014 namely, that Senator Menendez made specific decisions with respect to military sales to Egypt in exchange for bribes.\"",
      "Under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, senators or House members \"shall not be questioned\" for \"any speech or debate\" in either chamber of Congress. Stein had ruled that certain material referencing arms sales and military aid to Egypt were legislative acts shielded by the clause.",
      "Menendez's defense team said the information disclosed to the jury contained the only evidence that tied him to the provision of military aid to Egypt, which was at the center of the bribery scheme the New Jersey Democrat was accused of engaging in.",
      "They also lambasted prosecutors for attempting to \"shift the blame,\" calling it \"factually and legally outrageous.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the court had \"expressly prohibited\" evidence of past legislative activity, including actions Menendez allegedly took as a senator about foreign aid to Egypt, and said the evidence at issue \"squarely crossed that line \u2026 and allowed the jury to infer bribery from Senator Menendez's legislative acts \u2014 exactly what the Speech or Debate Clause is meant to prevent.\"",
      "Prosecutors claimed that Menendez helped orchestrate a corrupt agreement through which he would work to secretly benefit the Egyptian government in exchange for lavish gifts including cash, gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, furniture and mortgage payments from three New Jersey businessmen.",
      "He was convicted on 16 felony counts in July, including bribery, fraud and acting as a foreign agent.",
      "Menendez's two co-defendants in the case, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, also separately asked the court to grant them new trials and toss out their convictions.",
      "Menendez faced immense pressure to resign after he was indicted on federal bribery charges last year but resisted doing so until he was convicted. He stepped down from the Senate in August, a stunning capstone to a lengthy career in the upper chamber that included a position atop the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",

The Trump team announced Tuesday that it has signed the White House agreement.",
      "\"After completing the selection process of his incoming Cabinet, President-elect Trump is entering the next phase of his administration's transition by executing a Memorandum of Understanding with President Joe Biden's White House,\" said incoming Trump White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. \"This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power.\"",

She said the White House will work to protect non-public information and prevent conflicts of interest, despite the lack of a signed memo.",
      "And although White House officials say progress has been made toward a memorandum of understanding between the Trump team and the Justice Department, White House officials say no DOJ agreement has been signed. It's the Justice Department that is responsible for processing requests for security clearances for incoming administration officials who will need access to briefing materials and national security information, and those clearances cannot happen without a signed memorandum of understanding between the Trump transition team and the Justice Department.",
      "The Justice Department, not the White House or General Services Administration, is responsible for security clearances for transition personnel.",

      "Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center who focuses on presidential transitions, said the terms of the memo of understanding outlined Wiles reflect, in her assessment, an effort from the Trump transition team to shield themselves from transparency.",
      "\"They're sort of making it up as they go, because it's never been done like this before,\" she said.",

      "What could Trump's second term bring? Deportations, tariffs, Jan. 6 pardons and more",
      "While Wiles has suggested not signing the General Services Administration document saves taxpayer money, using taxpayer money comes with strings attached \u2014 specifically, more requirements for transparency and documentation, Dunn Tenpas said.",
      "\"If you take government resources, the memorandum with GSA requires that you then have to report all donations to the transition, and they cannot exceed $5,000 per person,\" she said. \"It's two things: One, they want the privacy of who their donors are and if they don't accept the GSA money, they don't have to disclose anything \u2014 and secondly, they have a few supporters, like Miriam Adelson and Elon Musk that are billionaires... So this notion of getting $7 million from the government to help jump-start your transition just isn't as attractive as it might have been to the Harris campaign, but I think more importantly, they probably don't want people to know that so-and-so gave $2 billion to the transition.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation's Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\"",
      "\"Together, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America's biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,\" he wrote.",
      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and during the first Trump administration \u2014 promoted \"herd immunity,\" the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\"I think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\" Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then-NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \"not mainstream science.\"",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Jim O'Neill, a former HHS official, will serve as deputy secretary of the sprawling agency. Trump said O'Neill \"will oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\" the president-elect announced.",
      "O'Neill is the only one of Trump's health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the bureaucracy to the job. Trump's previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for Food and Drug Administration commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",
      "Bhattacharya, who faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was also a plaintiff in Murthy v. Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in that case.",
      "After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he invited Bhattacharya to the company's headquarters to learn more about how his views had been restricted on the platform, which Musk renamed X. More recently, Bhattacharya has posted on X about scientists leaving the site and joining the alternative site Bluesky, mocking Bluesky as \"their own little echo chamber.\"",
      "Bhattacharya has argued that vaccine mandates that barred unvaccinated people from activities and workplaces undermined Americans' trust in the public health system.",
      "He is a former research fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economist at the RAND Corporation.",
      "The National Institutes of Health falls under HHS, which Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee. The NIH's $48 billion budget funds medical research on vaccines, cancer and other diseases through competitive grants to researchers at institutions across the nation. The agency also conducts its own research with thousands of scientists working at NIH labs in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Among advances that were supported by NIH money are a medication for opioid addiction, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, many new cancer drugs and the speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",

    "story": [
      "A California man who prosecutors alleged lied to federal agents and pushed fake criminal allegations against President Biden and his son Hunter now faces new charges of tax evasion from special counsel David Weiss, according to court records.",
      "Alexander Smirnov was an FBI informant for about a decade, providing information to federal investigators in what his defense attorneys claimed in court filings demonstrated an \"undivided, years-long loyalty to the United States.\"",
      "But Weiss \u2014 the Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. attorney who was kept on during the Biden administration and later elevated to the role of special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to continue the Hunter Biden probes \u2014 alleged in a February 2024 indictment that Smirnov illegally made false claims to FBI handlers about Hunter and Mr. Biden that dated back to 2020.",
      "Smirnov was accused of lying to investigators when he told them the two Bidens had each accepted $5 million from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The claims \"were false, as the Defendant knew,\" according to the charging documents filed against him.",
      "Smirnov, who court records say was born in Ukraine, pleaded not guilty to the charges and in court filings, his defense team has accused prosecutors of charging their client \"as a result of the rejection of Hunter Biden's plea resolutions.\" He remains in pretrial detention pending trial.",
      "On Nov. 21, just weeks before he was set to go to trial on Dec. 3, federal prosecutors in Weiss' office filed a little-noticed indictment in a separate case against Smirnov, alleging he had illegally concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in income between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Court records alleged Smirnov spent unreported income on a Las Vegas apartment, a Bentley and payments on credit card debt. Prosecutors did not name the alleged source of the funds, but the dates and amounts of his payments to him from a single company identified in their filing as \"Company 1\" coincide with payments they alleged Smirnov received from the Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation, which was named in court records filed in Smirnov's other case. The new charges do not indicate any wrongdoing by Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation. Other income came from an unnamed individual, the new indictment said.",
      "\"In order to conceal the millions of dollars he received in income in 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Defendant created and filed false Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns, for himself and in Domestic Partner's name that included false and fictitious income and expenses,\" the 27-page indictment filed last week said.",
      "According to newly published court records, the judge overseeing Weiss' first case against Smirnov \u2014 District Court Judge Otis Wright \u2014 held a status conference on Tuesday and delayed his upcoming trial on the false statements charges until January.",
      "Responding to the new tax charges, David Chesnoff, Smirnov's attorney, told CBS News, \"Mr. Smirnov intends to vigorously defend this case as he is vigorously defending the first case.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Weiss declined to comment when contacted by CBS News.",
      "Prosecutors alleged earlier this year that Smirnov's false claims against the Bidens were memorialized in an FBI document known as an FD 1023. Congressional Republicans previously pointed to that document's allegations of bribery as evidence of misdeeds and fought with the FBI to publicly release the document, which investigators now say contained fake allegations.",
      "Smirnov's attorneys have argued in court records that the case \"smacks of political bias.\" But prosecutors pushed back, writing this month that Smirnov, \"has never provided any discovery to the government or evidence to this Court supporting his baseless claims\u2014indeed, there is no such evidence because the claims are meritless.\"",
      "In court records filed earlier this year, the special counsel said Smirnov told the FBI about contacts with foreign intelligence officials, \"including Russian intelligence agencies, and has had such contacts recently.\" Defense attorneys in court filings of their own called allegations of Russian ties baseless.",
      "Apart from the specific charges at issue, law enforcement experts told CBS News earlier this year that the mounting questions about Smirnov's truthfulness should trigger an audit of every case in which he was involved. A CBS News investigation published earlier this year revealed that serious doubts about Smirnov's credibility were raised almost a decade ago.",
      "The FBI declined to comment on the results of the CBS News investigation earlier this year.",
      "Weiss secured a conviction against Hunter Biden in Delaware on illegal gun charges and a guilty plea from the president's son in a second case in California in which Hunter Biden admitted to tax fraud. He is set to be sentenced in both cases later this month.",
      "The trial conviction and guilty plea were the results of a protracted legal battle between Weiss's office and Hunter Biden's legal team after an initial plea and diversion agreement fell apart and ultimately were rejected by a federal judge in 2023.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:42:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and that drugs were a U.S. problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

      "Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations that have done the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday, are sweeping and include everything from not renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd to pulling out of a prominent gay rights index. And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X.

      "\"This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\" Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he'd been in conversation with Walmart.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don't feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. That would include chest binders intended for youths who are going through a gender change, the company said.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it isn't financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion isn't next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said.",
      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. The company said it didn't have quotas and won't do so going forward. It won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.",
      "Walmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to, according to its website, \"address the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.\"",
      "And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "\"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The changes come soon after an election win by former President Donald Trump, who's criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views, including his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while. For example, it's been moving away from using the word DEI in job titles and communications and started to use the word \"belonging.\" It also started making changes to its supplier program in the aftermath of the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling.",
      "Some have been urging companies to stick with their DEI policies. Last month, a group of Democrats in Congress appealed to the leaders of the Fortune 1000, saying DEI efforts give everyone a fair chance at achieving the American dream.",

    "story": [
      "Married couples across the U.S. have had access to no-fault divorce for more than 50 years, an option many call crucial to supporting domestic abuse victims and key to preventing already crowded family courts from drowning in complicated divorce proceedings.",
      "But some advocates for women worried as old comments from now Vice President-elect JD Vance circulated during the presidential campaign opposing no-fault divorce. And after President-elect Donald Trump and Vance won the election, warnings began popping up on social media urging women who might be considering divorce to \"pull the trigger\" while they still could. Some attorneys posted saying they were seeing a spike in calls from women seeking divorce consultations.",
      "Trump - who is twice-divorced - hasn't championed overhauling the country's divorce laws, but in 2021 Vance lamented that divorce is too easily accessible. Conservative podcasters and others have, as well.",
      "\"We've run this experiment in real time and what we have is a lot of very, very real family dysfunction that's making our kids unhappy,\" Vance said during a speech  at a Christian high school in California, where he criticized people being able to \"shift spouses like they change their underwear.\"",
      "Despite concerns, even those who want to make divorces harder to get say they don't expect big, swift changes. There is no national coordinated effort underway. And states determine their own divorce laws, so national leaders can't change policy.",
      "\"Even in some of the so-called red states, it hasn't gotten anywhere,\" said Beverly Willett, co-chair of the Coalition for Divorce Reform, whose group has unsuccessfully attempted to get states to repeal their no-fault divorce laws.",
      "Mark A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Washington, said that while many Americans have become accustomed to no-fault divorce being an option, Vance's previous comments on making it more difficult to separate from a spouse could help jumpstart that effort.",
      "\"Even though he's not directly proposing a policy, it's a topic that hasn't gotten a ton of discussion in the last 15 years,\" Smith said. \"And so to have a national profile politician talk that way is noteworthy.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Republican Party platforms in Texas and Nebraska were amended in 2022 to call for the removal of no-fault divorce. Louisiana's Republican Party considered something similar earlier this year but ultimately declined to do so.",
      "A handful of proposals have been introduced in conservative-led statehouses over the years, but all immediately stalled after they were filed.",
      "In January, Oklahoma Republican Sen. Dusty Deevers introduced legislation that would have kept married couples from filing for divorce on the grounds of incompatibility. Deevers backed the bill after writing a piece declaring no-fault divorce was an \"abolition of marital obligation.\"",
      "Similarly, in South Carolina, two Republican lawmakers in 2023 filed a bill that would have required both spouses to file for a no-fault divorce application rather than just one. And in South Dakota, a Republican lawmaker has attempted to remove irreconcilable difference as grounds for divorce since 2020.",
      "None of the sponsors of these bills responded to interview requests from The Associated Press. All are members of their state's conservative Freedom Caucus.",
      "Alarms sounded",
      "Nevertheless, some Democratic lawmakers say they remain worried about the future of no-fault divorce. They point to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to abortion in 2022 as an example of a long-accepted option that was revoked through a decades-long effort.",
      "\"When you choose to be silent, you allow for this to creep in,\" said Democratic South Dakota Rep. Linda Duba. \"These are the bills that gain a foothold because you choose to be silent.\"",
      "Before California became the first state to adopt a no-fault divorce option in 1969, married couples had to prove their spouse had violated one of the approved \"faults\" outlined in their state's divorce law or risk a judge denying their divorce, said Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Qualified reasons varied from state to state, but largely included infidelity, incarceration or abandonment.",
      "The system was a particular burden on domestic violence victims, often times women, who could be stuck in dangerous marriages while trying to prove their partner's abuse in court through expensive and lengthy legal proceedings.",
      "\"(Even) if there was any evidence that the couple both wanted to get divorced, that was supposed to be denied because divorce was not something you got because you wanted it, it was something you got because you've been wronged in a way that the state thought was significant,\" Grossman said.",
      "\"Extremely worried\"",
      "To date, every state in the U.S. has adopted a no-fault divorce option. However, 33 states still have a list of approved \"faults\" to file as grounds for divorce - ranging from adultery to felony conviction. In 17 states, married people only have the option of choosing no-fault divorce to end their marriages.",
      "Calls to reform no-fault divorce have remained fairly silent until the late 1990s, when concern pushed by former President George Bush's administration over the country's divorce rate sparked a brief movement for states to adopt \"covenant marriages.\" The option didn't replace a state's no-fault divorce law, but provided an option for couples that carried counseling requirements and strict exceptions for divorce.",
      "Louisiana was the first state to embrace covenant marriage options, but the effort largely stopped after Arizona and Arkansas followed suit.",
      "Christian F. Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, said she is \"extremely worried\" about the possibility of no-fault divorce being removed with the incoming Trump administration, Republican-controlled Congress and wide range of conservative state leaders.",
      "\"With so many states focusing on a misogynistic legislative agenda, this will turn back the clocks on women's rights even more,\" Nunes said in a statement. \"This is why removing 'no fault' divorce is another way for the government to control women, their bodies, and their lives. Eliminating no-fault divorce is also a backdoor way of eliminating gay marriage, since this implies that a marriage is only between a man and a woman.\"",
      "With Trump's reelection, Willett, whose group opposes no-fault divorce, said she's cautiously optimistic that the political tide could change.",
      "\"Was what he said an indication of things to come? I don't know,\" Willett said. \"It's a good thing but it's certainly not anything that has been really discussed other than a few high profile conservatives who talk about it.\""

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:46:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists now have a clearer picture of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base long hidden under the ice in Greenland, thanks to a NASA research team's good luck.",
    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

    "summary": "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all the unidentified people at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office.",
    "story": [
      "Some may have been lost hikers, runaway children, or wanderers.",
      "One thing connects the 58 or so remains at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office found with no identification card and no next of kin to claim them: They remain nameless.",
      "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all of the agency's unidentified people. But for now, five cases - all children and teens - have been sent for additional testing thanks to a $50,000 grant from Texas-based cold case resolution company Othram.",
      "They include the partial skeleton of a teenager found in Keehi Lagoon near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in 2002; parts of the body of a 7- to 10-year-old boy discovered in Waianae in 2000; six fingers of a girl under the age of 4 who was found in Honolulu in 2012; and the skeletal remains of an adolescent found mixed with animal bones inside of a vase purchased in Honolulu in 2015.",
      "The medical examiner's office wouldn't provide additional details about the cases, but medicolegal investigator Charlotte Carter said each represents a person whose family deserves closure.",
      "The five cases sent to Othram for testing were chosen in part because they are juveniles who DNA experts felt had a good chance of being identified through advanced technology.",
      "One case is connected to a 2014 homicide, so the medical examiners office declined to provide information while the investigation continues.",
      "For the case involving the severed fingers, it's unclear whether they belong to a child who died or only suffered trauma to their hands. The other cases could be missing children, a possibility that can't be ruled out until DNA testing is complete.",
      "Carter said she's committed to resolving the other unidentified cases in Honolulu's morgue, especially if DNA testing becomes more accessible and affordable.",
      "\"Anybody who's unidentified deserves to have a chance at being found and identified,\" she said, \"and given their name back.\"",
      "The Honolulu City Council in June accepted the grant from Houston-based Othram, which performs forensic genetic genealogy testing, which combines DNA analysis with genealogy research.",
      "So far, Carter said, none of the samples have been identified.",
      "Sparse information about each case is available publicly through the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, an organization funded by the National Institute of Justice, which runs a national database of unidentified, missing and unclaimed persons. Representatives with NamUs didn't respond to interview requests.",
      "For some cases, very little is known.",
      "For the skeletal remains found inside the vase in Honolulu, for example, forensic pathologists could not identify an age range, gender, height, weight or year of death - only that the person was still an adolescent.",
      "Other cases include more clues. The young boy found in Waianae in 2000 was suspected to have died that same year. He was recovered without a torso and was missing one or more of his limbs and one or both of his hands.",
      "A forensic artist reconstructed his face, which is included on his NamUs profile, showing what he may have looked like in life. He's listed in the missing children's database as \"John Waianae Doe 2000.\"",
      "Carter said it can take a year or more for DNA testing results to come back.",
      "Thus far, her agency has worked on one successful identification with Othram.",
      "Skeletal remains unearthed by a construction crew in Manoa in 2010 were tested and later identified as belonging to William Hans Holling Jr., a Washington man last seen by friends and family in January 1985. Othram identified Holling's remains and the Honolulu Police Department confirmed his identity in July. No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains open.",
      "Serial killer-rapist identified with the technology",
      "Forensic genetic genealogy testing enables investigators to search for an unidentified person's relatives as a starting point and, with the help of public records, to build a family tree they hope will get them closer to an identification.",
      "The method became popular in criminal investigations in the 2010s after companies like 23andMe and Ancestry came onto the market. Those companies block law enforcement agencies like the FBI from their databases, but investigators can use others, like GEDMatch, which is public-facing, and FamilyTreeDNA, which allows limited access by law enforcement, according to Stephen Kramer, a former FBI in-house counsel and founder of Indago Solutions, a DNA identification company.",
      "While still working with the FBI in 2018, Kramer helped identify the Golden State Killer using forensic genetic genealogy testing. Joseph James DeAngelo Jr., pleaded guilty to 13 murder and rape charges for crimes committed in the 1970s and '80s and has admitted overall to 161 crimes involving 48 victims, including dozens of rapes.",
      "Kramer's company recently identified Albert Lauro as the murder suspect in the 1991 killing of Dana Ireland on the Big Island.",
      "During a presentation to University of Hawaii law students this month, Kramer said genetic analysis of the DNA found on Ireland's body connected him to ancestry information about the suspect. He discovered the man was 83% Filipino, meaning he had three Filipino grandparents. He was also 5% European and Scandinavian, with the rest a mix of Hawaiian, Maori and South Pacific Islander.",
      "That told Kramer the suspect's fourth grandparent was about 30% European and 25% Pacific Islander, he said. Kramer focused on that grandparent because it's generally easier to find public records for people of European descent.",
      "He used records to identify people with this ancestry who had moved to Hawaii and married into Filipino families, leaving very few potential matches. He traced a family tree with three Filipino grandparents and one grandparent descending from Europeans, Scandinavians and Pacific Islanders.",
      "There, he found his suspect.",
      "Investigators followed Lauro by picking up a fork he discarded, which was tested against a DNA sample from Ireland's body.",
      "Detectives later reconfirmed Lauro's identity with a swab when they brought him in for questioning on July 19. Hawaii County Police Chief Ben Moszkowicz later said police didn't have enough probable cause to arrest Lauro for Ireland's murder, and they let him go.",
      "He killed himself four days later.",
      "Factors hindering use of the technology",
      "Lack of funds is the main obstacle to more intensive screening and forensic genetic genealogy on cold cases, Carter said. Each case costs about $10,000, and NamUs pays for Honolulu to send around five cases per year for testing.",
      "The 58 unidentified cases at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office date back to about 1966 and include people found under a variety of circumstances.",
      "Many are skeletal remains uncovered at construction sites, Carter said. Others are remains discovered by hikers that likely belonged to people who were homeless and living in encampments in remote parts of the island.",
      "If remains are found on tribal lands, are more than 50 years old or otherwise suspected to be Native Hawaiian, medical examiners contact the Department of Land and Natural Resources' State Historic Preservation Division for confirmation. If the remains are confirmed to be Native Hawaiian, the agency takes custody of them for repatriation.",
      "But some unidentified cases involve people who died fairly recently and, although they were physically recognizable when they were found, still haven't been claimed by family members or matched through any national database.",
      "Forensic pathologists haven't been able to identify a woman fatally struck by a car while trying to cross a road on May 21, 2016, Carter said. She was between 50 and 75 years old, of Asian or mixed Asian ancestry and appeared to be homeless, according to her NamUs profile. Her DNA was run through the national database and Honolulu police collected her fingerprints and sent them to the FBI but received no matches.",
      "A few people have come forward thinking they knew her, but her identity wasn't able to be confirmed, Carter said.",
      "\"That is a person who was a victim of a crime,\" she said. \"But, unfortunately, we're not able to figure out who she is.\"",
      "The most recent case was discovered on Oct. 9 when military personnel doing a training exercise found two femurs inside a camping tent off a hiking trail in Haleiwa.",
      "Carter said her office doesn't track statistics on identifications but said usually one or two unidentified remains are ID'd each year through DNA testing. If a person is identified but their next of kin can't be found, their case is moved to NamUs's unclaimed persons database.",
      "If family members are found, they are able to collect their relative's remains for burial or cremation, Carter said.",
      "She hopes that as technology improves, testing will become more accessible so every case can be resolved.",
      "\"I just think everybody deserves a name and their family deserves an answer,\" she said. \"We have a lot of families who are out there wondering what happened to somebody they love. And now that there's new technologies, we're maybe going to get a little step closer to having more closure or more processing to that new normal for those families.\"",

      "The Sombrero galaxy, named for its resemblance to the Mexican hat, is about 30 million light-years from Earth, NASA said in a news release. The galaxy is surrounded by multiple rings, where stars are formed. At its center is a supermassive black hole that emits a bright jet of light and consumes material from inside the galaxy. Both the rings and black hole are relatively docile, NASA said, and neither creates much solar activity each year.",
      "What sets the galaxy apart is its 2,000 globular clusters, or collections of hundreds of thousands of old stars held together by gravity, according to NASA. These clusters allow astronomers to study stars, since there are thousands of stars in one area. The stars are roughly the same age, but they vary in many other ways, allowing scientists to compare them.",

      "The outer ring had been photographed before, but appeared smooth. The more detailed MIRI images revealed intricate clumps along the rings. The images also show various galaxies in the background, which NASA said can allow astronomers to learn about their properties, including how far away they are from the Sombrero galaxy.",
      "The Webb telescope is set to begin its fourth year of science operations this summer, NASA said. Researchers are able to apply for observation time with the telescope, with a record-breaking 2,377 proposals submitted in October.

      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",

      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",

      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",

      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",

      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",

The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",

      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video).

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Some companies are weaving Trump's tariffs into their marketing efforts, telling consumers to buy now in case prices rise.",
    "story": [
      "Some retailers are using President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs to urge consumers to shop now, suggesting if the import duties go into effect next year, a\u00a0range of goods could cost Americans a lot more money.",
      "It's yet another sales tactic some companies are implementing, in addition to the traditional Black Friday discounts, to get consumers to spend as much as possible ahead of the holidays.",
      "On Monday, Trump pledged to add a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The proposed taxes are in addition to earlier campaign promises to impose a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, once he takes office.",
      "While\u00a0prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise if Trump moves forward with his tariff proposals, some retail experts say that retailers may be seeking to tap into people's universal fear of missing out on a limited-time offer or experience. But the tactic could also rub some shoppers the wrong way, experts caution.",
      "\"It's a double-edged sword. I think it it might get people interested in buying things, but it could also split consumers if they think everyone's going to bring their prices up,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. \"The other problem is it's slightly political as well, so some retailers would want to steer clear of it.\"",
      "While Trump has said he plans to move forward with tariffs, some economists have pointed out that the next administration may simply use the duties as a bargaining chip, which could enable the White House to strike new trade deals, for instance. Even though the tariffs are far from certain, a number of companies have explicitly said the levies floated by Trump would inevitably force them to raise prices for consumers.",
      "\"Lock in our current prices\"",
      "For example, filtered shower head maker Jolie recently said it would have pass along some of the anticipated costs from the tariffs to consumers. In a recent email to customers, the company said that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy CEO Corie Barry similarly said on its latest earnings call that the goods it sells could become more expensive under Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors on Nov. 26, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"Pre-tariff\" sales",
      "And on Facebook, a Dallas, Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings, announced a \"pre-tariff sale\" that runs until January, earlier this month.",
      "\"Get a deal while you still can,\" the retailer said.",
      "Finally Home Furnishings did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, or indicate how much it expects it may need to hike prices if new tariffs go into effect.",
      "Etsy seller Buzzy Park, who sells handmade bamboo picture frames, also advertised a \"pre-tariff \" sale on his entire inventory, starting this month and lasting until any new tariffs go into effect. \"Hurry and get them at their current prices,\" Park wrote in a social media post.",
      "While prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise, some marketing and retail experts say that even sellers who don't expect to face added costs could be using potential tariffs as an excuse to charge customers more.",
      "\"If consumers panic about things getting more expensive, they are playing right into the hands of companies around the country to use it as an excuse to raise prices, even when it's not necessary,\" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group. \"",

      "The remains of a World War II airman were identified 80 years after his plane was shot down during a bombing mission in Germany, military officials said this week.",
      "In the spring of 1944, U.S. Army Air Force Tech. Sgt. Sanford G. Roy, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, was assigned to the 732nd Bombardment Squadron in the European Theater, according to a news release from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Roy and several other airmen were aboard the B-24H Liberator \"Little Joe\" on a bombing mission to Brunswick, Germany on April 8. The plane was shot down by German forces and other airmen flying near the aircraft did not report seeing any crew members exiting \"Little Joe\" before it crashed. His name was engraved on the Walls of the Missing at the Netherlands American Cemetery.",
      "Though military members saw the incident, the crash site could not be located during the war. The remains of Roy and eight other crew members were listed as unaccounted for after the war. In 1946, the American Graves Registration Command began investigating bomber losses like the one that Roy died in in the region. Those efforts still failed to find any crash or burial sites associated with the crew of Little Joe.",
      "An independent research group finally shed new insight into the crash in 2015. The Missing Allied Air Crew Research Team contacted historians from the DPAA to inform them of a possible crash site near Wistedt, Germany. The DPAA conducted interviews with local residents, which led to the realization that there had been two crash sites, but only one had been examined and had remains recovered from it during the war.",
      "DPAA investigators found the second crash site and recovered various pieces of wreckage and possible human remains. Those remains were transferred to the DPAA's laboratory, but no identifications could be made. Between 2021 and 2023, the agency conducted more research at the crash site, including excavation and recovery of more remains. By the end of November 2023, all evidence from the crash site had been transferred to the DPAA laboratory.",
      "Scientists used anthropological and dental analysis, as well as DNA analysis, to identify the remains. One set of remains from the crash site were identified as those of\u00a0Staff Sergeant Ralph L. Mourer. Another set of remains was identified as Roy's.",
      "Roy's surviving family has been informed of his identification. He will be buried in his hometown on April 8, 2025, the 81st anniversary of his loss. A rosette has been carved next to his name on the Walls of the Missing to indicate that he has been identified.",

    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0flew to Florida to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Canada's CBC News reported. The meeting comes in the wake of Trump's threat to impose tariffs on goods coming from Canada.",
      "Trudeau was expected to dine with Trump at Mar-a-largo Friday night, according to senior sources who spoke to CBC News on condition they not be named due to the sensitivity of the trip. The sources said the meeting was pushed for by Canadian officials, the Canadian broadcaster said.",
      "Trudeau's plane landed at Palm Beach International Airport at about 5:30 p.m. local time. A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday from Mar-a-Lago. The Trump transition team did not comment on the meeting when reached by CBS News.",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives, a person familiar with the dinner plans who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press.",
      "Also attending the dinner, the person told the AP, were Republican Senator-elect David McCormick of Pennsylvania, and his wife Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.",
      "The meeting comes after Trudeau earlier Friday cautioned that if Trump follows through on this threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, he would be raising prices for Americans and hurting American businesses.",
      "Trump\u00a0has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products\u00a0entering the U.S.\u00a0from Canada and\u00a0Mexico\u00a0as one of his first executive orders.",
      "\"It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it,\" Trudeau said to reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada earlier Friday.",
      "\"Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,\" he added.",
      "Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries, but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products, including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.",
      "Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump's team negotiated during his first term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a \"win-win\" for both countries.",
      "\"We can work together as we did previously,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Although Trump once called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest\" during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the Group of Seven countries to visit Trump since the Nov. 4 election.",
      "Trump aide Corey Lewandowski, speaking on Fox News Friday night, said that he was \"certain\" that Trudeau \"is going to come down and have a conversation with the president and say, 'Sir, what can we do to keep this border open, what can we do to keep goods flowing? We know we have problems we are here to fix it.'\"",
      "Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but they are ready to make new investments in border security.",
      "\"We're going to work together to meet some of the concerns,\" Trudeau said. \"But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that\u00a0a tariff war with the United States\u00a0will be averted. Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with her and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

Video from The Associated Press showed their bodies placed next to each other on the floor inside the hospital's morgue.",
      "The flow of food allowed into Gaza by Israel has fallen to nearly its lowest level of almost 14-month-long war for the past two months, according to Israeli official figures. U.N. and aid officials say hunger and desperation are growing among Gaza's population, almost all of which relies on humanitarian aid to survive.",

But it does not address the devastating war in Gaza. For Palestinians in Gaza and families of hostages held in the territory, the ceasefire marked another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months.",

      "Prologue",
      "This book tells a story that will not happen again, because the state I lived in for thirty-five years ceased to exist in 1990. If it had been offered to a publishing house as a work of fiction, it would have been turned down, someone said to me early in 2022, a few weeks after I stepped down from the office of federal chancellor. He was familiar with such issues, and was glad that I had decided to write this book, precisely because of its story. A story that is as unlikely as it is real. It became clear to me: telling this story, drawing out its lines, finding the thread running through it, identifying leitmotifs, could also be important for the future.",
      "For a long time I couldn't imagine writing such a book. That first changed in 2015, at least a little. Back then, in the night between September 4 and 5, I had decided not to turn away the refugees coming from Hungary at the German-Austrian border. I experienced that decision, and above all its consequences, as a caesura in my chancellorship. There was a before and an after. That was when I undertook to describe, one day when I was no longer chancellor, the sequence of events, the reasons for my decision, my understanding of Europe and globalization bound up with it, in a form that only a book would make possible. I didn't want to leave the further description and interpretation just to other people.",
      "But I was still in office. The 2017 Bundestag election followed, along with my fourth period of office. In its last two years the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic was the predominant theme. The pandemic, as I said publicly on several occasions, made huge demands on democracy, on a national, European, and global level. This also prompted me to broaden my outlook and not only write about refugee policy. If I was going to do it at all, I had to do it properly, I said to myself, and if I was, then I would do it with Beate Baumann. She has been advising me since 1992, and is an eyewitness.",
      "I stepped down from office on December 8, 2021. After sixteen years I left it, as I said at the Bundeswehr's Military Tattoo in my honor a few days before, with joy in my heart. By the end I had in fact longed for that moment. Enough was enough. Now it was time to take a break and rest for a few months, leave the frantic world of politics behind me, to begin a new life in the spring, slowly and tentatively, still a public life, but not an active political one, find the right rhythm for public appearances\u2014and write this book. That was the plan.",
      "Then came February 24, 2022, Russia's attack on Ukraine.",
      "It was immediately clear that writing this book as if nothing had happened was completely out of the question. The war in Yugoslavia at the beginning of the 1990s had already shaken Europe to its core. But the Russian attack on Ukraine was a greater threat. It was a breach of international law that shattered the European peace which had prevailed since the Second World War and was based on the preservation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of its states. Profound disillusionment followed. I will write about that too. But this is not a book about Russia and Ukraine. That would be a different book.",
      "Instead I would like to write the story of my two lives, the first up to 1990 in a dictatorship and the second since 1990 in a democracy. At the moment when the first readers hold this book in their hands, the two halves are of more or less equal length. But in fact, of course, these are not two lives. In fact they are one life, and the second part cannot be understood without the first.",
      "How did it happen that, after spending the first thirty-five years of her life in the GDR, a woman was able to take over the most powerful office that exists in the Federal Republic of Germany and hold it for sixteen years? And that she left it again without having to step down during a period of office or being voted out? What was it like to grow up in East Germany as the child of a pastor, and study and work under the conditions of a dictatorship? What was it like to experience the collapse of a state? And to be suddenly free? That's the story I want to tell.",
      "Of course, my account is deeply subjective. At the same time, I have aimed for honest self-reflection. Today, I will identify my misjudgments and defend the things I think I got right. But this is not a complete account of everything that happened. Not everyone who might have expected, or who might have been expected, to appear in these pages will do so. For that I request understanding. My goal is to establish some points of focus with which I attempt to tame the sheer mass of material, and allow people to understand how politics works, what principles and mechanisms there are\u2014and what guided me.",
      "Politics isn't witchcraft. Politics is made by people, people with their influences, their experiences, vanities, weaknesses, strengths, desires, dreams, convictions, values, and interests. People who need to fight for majorities in a democracy if they want to make things happen.",
      "We can do this\u2014Wir schaffen das. Throughout the whole of my political career, no phrase has been thrown back at me with quite such virulence as this one. No phrase has been so polarizing. For me, however, it was quite an ordinary phrase. It expressed an attitude. Call it trust in God, caution, or simply a determination to solve problems, to deal with setbacks, get over the lows and come up with new ideas. \"We can do this, and if something stands in our way it has to be overcome, it has to be worked on.\" That was how I put it in my summer press conference on August 31, 2015. That was how I did politics. It's how I live. It's also how this book came about. With this attitude, which is also something learned, everything is possible, because it isn't only politics that contributes to it\u2014every individual person has a part to play.",

      "One afternoon Stafford Shurden took me through his family's land. A Taurus semiautomatic pistol rested casually on his console. His family footprint once stretched to the gates of Parchman, the infamous Gothic prison farm that serves as the Mississippi State Penitentiary, one of the worst and most feared prisons in the country. The front gate is twelve miles north of the barn.",
      "At the end of the drive we stopped at his family's old farm office, which would have been buzzing with people back when the Shurdens ran this little corner of the world. Now it's empty. He found a key on a big ring and opened the door.",
      "We stepped into the dark, silent room. The first thing Stafford did was go sit in his father's old desk chair made out of a green bucket seat from an old classic Thunderbird. He hoped the old man would be proud of him. A painting showed Black cotton pickers moving through a field with their long bags, with the Shurden Farms logo on the trailers parked around them. Stafford sighed.",

In a little side office was a huge map of their part of Sunflower County. It documented who owned every piece of land, divided into squares and rectangles and trapezoids, into little homesteads and big plantations. I looked down at the corner and saw the date: \"Jan 1, 1956.\"",
      "This was the first county land map made after the murder. I ran my finger along the sides of the map and found the barn: Township 22 North, Range 4 West, Section 2, West Half, measured from the Choctaw Meridian. Familiar names claimed plots all around the old Milam farm. Smaller pieces of land were marked only by initials. I found the Dougherty Bayou and all the nearby farms and then the barn. It was the only piece of dirt on the map without a name.",
      "Thomas Jefferson wrote a law that would pass Congress as the Land Ordinance of 1785. His goal was simple. He wanted the empty open space of his new country to be broken into small blocks and sold to yeoman farmers\u2014small, entirely independent (white) landowners\u2014and so he took a system invented by a military engineer named Thomas Hutchins and codified it into law. Many ancient cultures were built around the idea of shared land. America was built around the idea of owning parceled land. That foundational urge was born in the moment when Jefferson put pen to page. Yeomen weren't plantation lords like Jefferson and they weren't poor white trash. To Jefferson their protection and elevation in American life was the hill upon which this new nation would live or die. The first draft of the bill broke the country into ten\u2011mile\u2011by\u2011ten\u2011mile squares called hundreds, while a second reduced them to seven\u2011mile\u2011by\u2011seven\u2011mile squares called townships. On May 3, 1785, William Grayson of Virginia made a motion to change the seven to a six and James Monroe seconded the motion. They would send surveyors out into every bit of new territory America amassed\u2014starting with the land won from the English in the Revolutionary War\u2014and divide it into thirty\u2011six\u2011square\u2011mile blocks, which would be divided into thirty\u2011six smaller squares named sections. Each section was 640 acres, or one square mile, and the sale of all this public land would pay down the war debt of the new nation, which hadn't yet been able to agree on a way to raise money through taxes. A permanent grid appeared overnight.",
      "A central American conflict was baked into this first drawing of the new nation. Jefferson wanted the land to be settled by yeomen. But the price for the newly available land was simply too high for most farmers to pay. In the decades that followed, Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party and Jefferson's Republican Party fought over this issue. From John Adams through Jefferson and into Madison and Monroe, the minimum purchase amount (and the price) rose and fell depending on whether those in power wanted to help capitalist landowners or small, independent farmers. The Land Law of 1800 reduced the minimum purchase to 320 acres, which was cut to 160, then again to 80, and finally, in 1832, to 40 acres. The base price was about a dollar an acre. This fight between capitalized investors and small farmers dominated the politics of the new nation and would play out brutally on the land surrounding Drew, Mississippi.",
      "The barn sits on the southwest quarter of Section 2, Township 22 North, Range 4 West, measured from the Choctaw Meridian. That's its exact legal location on Jefferson's grid: a square mile per section, thirty\u2011six sections per township, over and over again across the new nation. The thirty\u2011six square miles of Township 22 North, Range 4 West, have borne witness to the birth of the blues at the nearby Dockery Plantation, to the struggle of Fannie Lou Hamer, to the machinations of a founding family of the Klan, and to the death of Emmett Till.",
      "To get to Dockery, take a right out of Jeff Andrews's driveway, take another right on Ralph Ray Road toward the Bolivar County line, and then turn left on Dockery Road. Dockery Farms has been called the birthplace of the Delta blues by B. B. King and many others. It's not an accident then that this land fueled the first protest music. The blues came from the land around the barn. From Charley Patton, the Black grandson of a white man. Patton's music flowed from a place of rage about how he lived a small, threatened life because his grandmother was Black \u2014 \"skin the color of rape,\" the poet Caroline Randall Williams wrote. He became the first blues star, the man who taught Son House, who taught Robert Johnson, who taught Muddy Waters, who hailed from the same Delta town as Sam Cooke and Nate Dogg, all these genres making the same protest music against the same forces as Patton\u2014Delta blues or G\u2011funk, Muddy and \"I'm a full\u2011grown man\" or Sam's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" or Ice Cube and \"F**k tha Police.\" Eazy\u2011E's grandparents ran a grocery store sixteen blocks up Broadway in Greenville from the house where J.W. Milam lived when he died.",
      "The Dockery family still owns their plantation. Now the granddaughters of the founder control the business. One of them, a distinguished elderly woman named Douglas Dockery Thomas, agreed to meet me in her New York apartment. Her building is on the Upper East Side, overlooking the Metropolitan Museum and Central Park. She's on the board at the Metropolitan Opera and is one of the central patrons of the Met. The doorman was expecting me. The elevator opened directly into her apartment, which covered an entire floor, easily more than four thousand square feet.",
      "She led me into a formal parlor with a piano under tall ceilings and crown molding. I looked down at the museum and the yellow cabs on Fifth Avenue. Hers is some of the most expensive residential real estate in the world. The final vapors of the Gilded Age moved through the empty rooms in a world where history stopped in 1929, or maybe 1955. Nothing we talk about can be on the record, she says. The family remains very private. Her son, I've read, is an incredibly successful venture capitalist, the money behind Venmo and BuzzFeed, among others. We talked about Mississippi. Our families knew each other. On a side table was a picture of her with King Charles III when he was Prince of Wales. I noticed her sharp cheekbones and delicate wrists. She loves the opera but also loves the blues and has set up Dockery as a living museum to honor her parents, Joe Rice and Keith, and the music that came to life on the family farm. Her mother especially seemed to understand that the line all white southerners need to see or be shown wasn't between good and bad, but between cowardly and brave.",
      "\"If I had not been married to Joe,\" Keith said, \"I might have been out on the streets marching with the protestors. But I was, and I didn't.\"",
      "Willie Reed stepped out of his family home for the last time on a Friday night. He moved alone into the darkness. He had been told the plan and followed it carefully. Lots of people wanted him dead. He'd dared to accuse a white man of murder. In his arms he carried a coat and an extra pair of pants. Everything else he left behind. No account survives of the feelings in that dark house, the sorrow and fear, the words spoken and unspoken. It must have felt like a scene from a different time, a man forced into exile, facing a kind of ancient judgment surely not possible in 1955. The history books say he walked six miles in the dark. Nobody knows for sure which direction but when you look at the map, and understand who lived in the houses lining the roads, there's only one route he could have taken: down the Drew\u2011Cleveland Road, now the Drew\u2011Ruleville Road, skirting the edge of Dockery Farms.",
      "I've driven that road at night, in a big, modern Chevrolet four\u2011 wheel\u2011drive, with my armor of white skin, with a .40\u2011caliber semi\u2011 automatic pistol in the glove box, and even then it's spooky. The darkness of rural Mississippi remains a physical thing, heavy and alive, a sonic experience, too, loud with bugs and birds. There is no safety outside the civilization of headlights. If someone wanted to kill you, there would be nobody to hear you scream. If someone approached, there would be no place to hide. This road was by far Reed's safest option, lined with poor Black families. He only had two other options to escape. The first, the Drew\u2011Merigold Road, would have taken him through the only real community of small, poor, white farmers in the Delta. That was suicide. He could have run into the town of Drew. Also suicide. That left Ruleville, which is 6.6 miles from his house and still risky. One of the policemen in the city of Ruleville was J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant's brother. Reed likely passed his girlfriend Ella Mae Stubbs's home. He didn't have time to tell her goodbye.",
      "A car waited in the dark at the end of the road. The driver took Reed north on Highway 61 through Cleveland and Merigold, finally reaching Mound Bayou and safety. Another car awaited him there. The man behind the steering wheel was Medgar Evers. The other passenger was Congressman Diggs. The three men drove north in Evers's Oldsmobile 88 with a big\u2011block V\u20118, which he had bought specifically to outrun the white terrorists who'd follow and chase him through the backroads of the rural state. His speedometer glowed red whenever he got over sixty miles an hour, which he did as the three men roared toward Memphis Airport. When they arrived, Diggs and Reed went inside the terminal. They probably took the 10:00 a.m. Delta\u2011C&S 686 from Memphis to Chicago, with a stop in Saint Louis, each leg exactly an hour and nine minutes. That's three hours with the layover to try to imagine what awaited them when the plane touched down. In Chicago, Diggs took Willie to Congressman William Dawson's office. Dawson had represented the South Side of Chicago since 1943. An uncle met him up there. Two strangers approached them.",
      "\"Willie?\" \"Willie Reed?\"",
      "Both Reed and his uncle felt terror. He'd already been found. The fear eased when the men introduced themselves as Chicago police officers. They'd been assigned to make sure Reed was safe in his new home. Reed struggled to focus as his uncle took him to his mother's walk\u2011up apartment at 2103 South Michigan, two blocks from what is now the Marriott Marquis, across the street from the Chess Records studio where the Rolling Stones would one day visit and find their hero Muddy Waters painting the walls of the lobby.",
      "Reporters met Reed there in the first hours of his exile. \"Everybody is scared,\" he told them. \"Why? What did we do?\" They asked him about the world he'd left behind.",
      "\"I feel kind of lonely for Ella Mae,\" he said.",
      "The next morning charitable strangers offered to write blank checks to bring Ella Mae Stubbs to Chicago. Mississippi reporters went out to the Clark Plantation and found her father, Ernest Stubbs, and asked his opinion. He said his daughter barely knew Willie Reed and that his family was perfectly happy in Mississippi.",
      "Willie Reed never saw Ella Mae Stubbs again.",
      "A Jackson Daily News reporter, Bill Spell, flew up to Chicago in a state\u2011owned airplane to \"interview\" him. The whole point was to let Willie know that Mississippi could reach him anytime it wanted. Spell would confess later in life that Senator Eastland's office was actively digging up dirt on the Till family and actually delivering prewritten hatchet jobs to the Jackson paper where he worked. The reporter, a member of the National Guard, got his commanding officer to approve a military flight to Chicago. Spell found Reed in Michael Reese Hospital, located in Bronzeville on the South Side, with what best can be described as a nervous breakdown. His room was in between the train station where Emmett's body would arrive and the little piece of sidewalk where Sonny Boy Williamson got murdered as he walked home from a gig. A month later, Reed swallowed his fear and returned to Mississippi to testify in Leflore County as a grand jury debated indicting Milam and Bryant for kidnapping. He told his story and flew back to Chicago. The grand jury declined to bring charges, just as the jury in Sumner had acquitted Milam and Bryant, and with that the legal proceedings in the case of Emmett Till ended.",
      "Reed changed his name to Willie Louis soon after. That had been his father's last name and he wanted to be anonymous again. Every day he went to work as a surgical technician in a South Side hospital, located between Michelle Obama's childhood home and the house of poet Gwendolyn Brooks. Mamie Till-Mobley, Simeon Wright, and Wheeler Parker all lost touch with him and thought he'd been killed. Willie Louis vanished into working-class Chicago. He would go many years before telling another person about what he'd heard that morning inside Leslie Milam's barn.",

Roy, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, was assigned to the 732nd Bombardment Squadron in the European Theater, according to a news release from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Roy and several other airmen were aboard the B-24H Liberator \"Little Joe\" on a bombing mission to Brunswick, Germany on April 8. The plane was shot down by German forces and other airmen flying near the aircraft did not report seeing any crew members exiting \"Little Joe\" before it crashed.

    "summary": "The U.S. is among 175 nations haggling over a treaty to reduce the vast quantity of plastic pollution that ends up in our food, water and even our bodies.",
    "story": [
      "Delegates from 175 countries have been meeting this week in Busan, South Korea, in an attempt to negotiate a legally binding treaty to address global plastic pollution. The gathering marks the fifth and final phase of multiyear talks of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC-5), with a decision expected on a treaty when the summit ends on Sunday.",
      "\"We have a historic moment to end the world's plastic pollution crisis and protect our environment, our health, and our future,\" Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, told attendees at the start of the week's negotiations, calling it a \"moment of truth\" for the delegations, and the planet.",
      "The talks have been marred by a wide gap in opinions between delegations from small, often developing nations, and more advanced economies \u2014 and some major global corporations whose presence is, in itself, controversial.",
      "The nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law said Wednesday that fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists at INC-5 collectively formed the single largest delegation. The 220 registered corporate lobbyists at the summit outnumber all the delegates representing European Union nations combined.",
      "\"Their strategy is designed to preserve the financial interests of countries and companies who are putting their fossil-fueled profits above human health, human rights and the future of the planet,\" said Delphine Levi Alvares, CIEL's global petrochemicals campaign manager.",
      "What's the goal of INC-5?",
      "The goal of the summit is to finalize a legally binding treaty to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that enters the environment and address the scourge of waste already clogging the world's waterways and landfills and contaminating everything from the food and water we consume to our arteries.",
      "The INC-5 delegations were tasked with defining reduction targets, determining how to regulate hazardous waste and chemicals and outlining criteria to manage the entire life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal.",
      "If they do come to an agreement and ratify a new treaty, then it will be adopted Sunday and future meetings of the group will be held to ensure signatory countries are complying.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "There's little dispute that something must be done to tackle plastic pollution, but how to do it remains contentious.",
      "One of the solutions discussed this week has been a potential cap on plastic production, but the idea has proven deeply unpopular among nations whose economies still lean heavily on the production of plastics and fossil fuels, which are essential to making plastic, including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States.",
      "Another topic under negotiation is whether to impose an outright ban on certain chemicals used in some plastics that are known to be toxic to the environment and dangerous to human health. There is historical precedent for such focused bans, including the decades-old Montreal Protocol, which saw the production of ozone-depleting chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) barred universally.",
      "Island nations and developing countries are \u2014 just as with climate change \u2014 among those most directly impacted by plastic pollution, but least responsible for producing the waste.",
      "Some of these countries say a plastic pollution treaty is vital to preserve their fragile ecosystems and public health.",
      "Speaking on behalf of the Small Islands Developing States group at the talks, Penivao Moealofa, of the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said it was \"already a challenge to manage our own plastic waste, and it is an injustice to us to continue to manage others' plastic waste, especially when we contribute to less than 1.3% of the total global plastic waste.\"",
      "If policies are not implemented to change things, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says \"annual plastics production, use and waste generation are projected to increase by 70% in 2040 compared to 2020,\" when the world churned out roughly 480 million tons of new plastic products.",
      "Where do different countries stand on plastic pollution?",
      "A group of 68 countries or blocs, including Canada, the EU, Mexico and Australia, have come to be known as the High Ambition Coalition (HAC). Their leaders have backed the goal of stopping all new plastic pollution from entering the environment by 2040, and they believe countries that create the most plastic, including the U.S., should pay to transition the global economy away from the reliance on new plastics.",
      "In a joint statement for INC-5, the HAC highlighted the importance of creating global rules to ensure products are designed with circularity in mind. Circularity is the concept in sustainability of reusing and repurposing products, rather than using and then discarding them, to reduce the amount of waste.",
      "The petrochemical industry has been broadly supportive of a treaty, but it firmly opposes production caps and would prefer to rely on other solutions, such as recycling. But as CBS News has previously reported, recycling many plastics is incredibly challenging, expensive, and has not been scaled up to anywhere near the level that would make it a viable solution to the problem.",
      "Scientists have suggested that, given the pace at which new plastic products are being manufactured, recycling won't be sufficient to combat its impact, and reduced production should be the first priority.",
      "In August, Reuters reported a shift in U.S. government policy to support a global treaty calling for a reduction in plastic production, but three months later, nonprofit news website Grist reported the Biden administration was backtracking on that support ahead of INC-5.",
      "The U.S. State Department has called for an agreement that works \"towards ending plastic pollution entering the environment by 2040,\" but the American policy leans largely on recycling and circularity as primary mechanisms to achieve the goal \u2014 solutions supported by the petroleum and chemical industries.",
      "Another factor weighing on the minds of many delegates in Busan this week is the fact that the U.S. delegation was sent by the soon-to-depart Biden administration. There's concern that any commitments Washington does make could be abandoned by the incoming Trump team.",

      "\"We are the safeguard, this place, this Parliament, you and me,\" he said. \"We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm and yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role.\"",

      "At its heart, the bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided with help to end their life, subject to safeguards and protections. They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet had said they would support the bill, while others were against it. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, said she would vote against it.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction. More than 500 British people have ended their lives in Switzerland, where the law allows assisted dying for nonresidents.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

    "summary": "Sinn F\u00e9in, the former political arm of the IRA, is hoping Ireland's 2024 election will bring it to power for the first time ever.",
    "story": [
      "Dublin \u2014 Voting began Friday in Ireland's general election after a campaign that left the country's three biggest political parties \u2014 Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il, and Sinn F\u00e9in \u2014 locked in what polls suggested was a dead heat. The voting will see Irish citizens choose lawmakers to fill all 174 seats in the country's parliament, with the winning party or parties likely forming a new government and picking Ireland's next prime minister.",
      "Here's what to know about the Republic of Ireland's general election.",
      "Who is up for election in Ireland?",
      "Incumbent Taoiseach (prime minister) Simon Harris, of the center-right Fine Gael party, called the election on Nov. 8, making way for a three-week general election campaign.",
      "Either Fine Gael or the centrist Fianna F\u00e1il party \u2014 which have led Ireland together for the last four years under the current coalition \u2014 have produced every Irish prime minister since the republic gained independence from Great Britain just over a century ago. In the aftermath of the last general election in 2020, the two longtime rivals, whose political divide can be traced back to the Irish civil war of the 1920s, came together to form the coalition.",
      "The opposition, left-wing nationalist party Sinn F\u00e9in \u2014 the oldest political party on the Emerald Isle and previously the political arm of the Irish Republican Army \u2014 is seeking to break that cycle and become at least part of Ireland's government for the first time ever.",
      "But that remains a high hurdle for Sinn F\u00e9in.",
      "The latest opinion polls suggest Sinn F\u00e9in will win around 19.5% of the vote, a share that would leave it lagging slightly behind both Fine Gael, which is polling at around 21%, and Fianna F\u00e1il with about 21.5% of the vote. The remaining 40% of the votes are expected to be distributed among independent candidates and smaller political parties, which could have an outsized say when it comes to the horsetrading involved in building a coalition government if there is, as polls suggest, no big majority winner.",
      "Given that the leaders of both Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael have publicly vowed not to form a coalition with the main opposition party, Sinn F\u00e9in would need to exceed expectations and overtake the two other parties in the number of seats its candidates win to put itself in the driver's seat of the next government.",
      "Over the course of 2024, more than half of the world's population has had the opportunity to vote on new leadership. In a majority of those countries, voters have decisively rejected incumbent governments.",
      "So, if Irish voters do usher the return of some form of Fine Gael-Fianna F\u00e1il coalition \u2014 considered the most likely scenario based on recent polling \u2014 it would buck the global trend.",
      "What's at stake in Ireland's election?",
      "A Sinn F\u00e9in victory would represent a seismic shift in Ireland's political landscape. It's a party best known around the world as the former political wing of the IRA, the terrorist Irish republican group that wrought decades of violence on the island and in Britain during a dark period of bloodshed known as \"The Troubles.\"",
      "More than 3,500 people are believed to have been killed between 1969 and 1998 as militants loyal to the British government and crown fought a bitter guerrilla war against the IRA and other nationalist Irish paramilitary groups.",
      "In the years since the U.S.-brokered Good Friday Peace Accords brought an end to that violence in 1998, Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald has sought to distance the party from its militant past, focusing instead on left-wing economic populism and, in particular, addressing the country's long-running housing crisis.",
      "In the aftermath of 2020's general election, when Sinn F\u00e9in shocked many observers by winning a lion's share of the popular vote \u2014 though not enough seats in parliament to gain a position in the government \u2014 it appeared as though McDonald's strategy was working.",
      "McDonald, who succeeded the party's longtime stalwart Gerry Adams as Sinn F\u00e9in's leader in 2018, appeared to be on a trajectory to become the country's first female leader.",
      "Sinn F\u00e9in remains the party with the most serious public commitment to achieving the aspiration of Irish nationalists \u2014 a united Ireland that includes what has, since 1921, been British-ruled Northern Ireland. McDonald has pledged to push for a referendum on Irish unification both in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland by 2030 if she's elected.",
      "Sinn F\u00e9in currently leads Northern Ireland's own semi-autonomous, power-sharing government, so securing a victory in the republic could be enormously consequential in making that referendum happen, though it's unclear how much Britain's central government in London could try to stand in the way of such a vote.",
      "Just as in the rest of Europe and in the U.S., immigration has dominated much of the political debate in Ireland in recent years. A wave of anti-immigrant sentiment, fuelled by the lack of affordable housing in the country, has swept over Ireland.",
      "The country was rattled when\u00a0far-right rioters, incited by a partially false claim on social media suggesting an illegal immigrant had stabbed young children, brought chaos to Dublin's streets last year.",
      "That sentiment has eaten into a key base of support for Sinn F\u00e9in, which is largely pro-immigration. Independent and fringe right-wing populist candidates have made gains in Irish opinion polls, as they've gained seats in recent local, national and European Union elections over the past year.",
      "Early polls suggested Sinn F\u00e9in was losing momentum as the current election campaign got underway.",
      "Simon Harris, the energetic 38-year-old leader of Fine Gael, has worked hard to keep Sinn F\u00e9in out of power. Ireland's youngest-ever prime minister took office last April and, in the months since, he's sought to assuage voter concerns about key issues including immigration and the housing and the cost of living crises.",
      "A savvy social media strategy saw the Irish press dub Harris the \"TikTok Taoiseach\" and, under him, Fine Gael did gain ground with voters ahead of Friday's election.",
      "Ireland's famously low corporation tax has led to huge investment from outside the country \u2014 not least by U.S. businesses, making it the envy of many other European nations.",
      "Unlike their financially strapped British neighbors, the Irish government currently boasts a sizable budget surplus, which left the incumbents plenty of resources to tempt voters with promises of electricity credits, welfare payments and tax breaks in the months before Harris called the election.",
      "But the advantage brought by Ireland's tax policy could soon face some stiff competition. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to match Ireland's corporate tax rate in the U.S., a policy sweetener that could incentivize American multinationals in Dublin to pick up their business and head back home.",
      "For the purposes of this election, however, the national budget surplus has doubtlessly benefited both Harris and Deputy Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, the 64-year old veteran leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, as they vie to become the country's next leader.",
      "The last-minute gift of a gaffe",
      "Sinn F\u00e9in and Fianna F\u00e1il were offered a late gift as their campaigns wound down.",
      "In the final week, Fine Gael's lead dropped by gut-punching six points, according to one Irish Times poll, after Taoiseach Harris was accosted on camera by a woman in a supermarket who protested that his government wasn't doing enough to support disability care workers like herself.",
      "The clip, which went viral, showed Harris tensely denying the woman's claims before awkwardly offering a handshake and then walking away. Opponents have criticized him for being insensitive.",
      "Whether it proves to be decisive in swinging the election toward his centrist coalition partners, or toward a landmark win for Sinn F\u00e9in, will only become clear on Saturday as the votes are counted.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",

Lebanon's state-run media said the wounded were civilians, while the Israeli military described them as suspects who violated the terms of the truce that ended more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that \"several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire. The IDF opened fire toward them.\"",
      "\"The IDF remains in southern Lebanon and will actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement,\" the military said.",
      "Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Israeli fire wounded two civilians in Markaba, a village close to the border that has been a scene of intense fighting over the past 14 months. It also reported Israeli tank fire hitting some villages and farms in the south, causing no casualties.",
      "The bursts of violence \u2014 with no reports of serious casualties \u2014 reflected the uneasy nature of the ceasefire that otherwise appeared to hold Thursday as Lebanese troops began to deploy in parts of southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has based its operations.",
      "The Lebanese military said it was setting up temporary checkpoints and detonating unexploded ordnance in hopes of helping displaced civilians return to their homes.",
      "Some 1.2 million people were displaced in Lebanon during the country's deadliest war in decades. Thousands of residents, their cars stacked high with mattresses and full of belongings, began to make the odyssey back to their war-ravaged towns on Wednesday, after the ceasefire took effect.",
      "But their movements remain constrained. The Lebanese and Israeli militaries have ordered civilians displaced from border communities to steer clear of areas where Israeli troops are still in position.",
      "Col. Avichay Adraee, an Arabic language spokesman for the Israeli military, announced that a nighttime curfew for Lebanese residents south of the Litani River remained in effect, banning movement from 5 p.m. Thursday until 7 a.m. Friday.",
      "The Lebanese army also accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire several times on Thursday by conducting strikes on Lebanon with \"various weapons\" and continuing to patrol and surveil Lebanese skies with warplanes and drones. The army said it was \"following up on these violations in coordination with the relevant authorities,\" without elaborating.",
      "An Associated Press reporter in northern Israel near the border heard Israeli drones buzzing overhead and the sound of artillery strikes in Lebanon.",
      "Hezbollah has not issued any public statements on the alleged Israeli ceasefire violations but Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah acknowledged the incidents. When asked by reporters how Hezbollah would respond, he was cautious.",
      "\"We don't want to rush things,\" he said, adding that Hezbollah \"has the right to self-defense.\"",
      "The agreement, brokered by the United States and France, includes an initial two-month ceasefire in which Hezbollah militants are to withdraw north of the Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. As Israeli forces withdrawal, the buffer zone will be patrolled by Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers moving in to take their place, but it is expected to take weeks, and Israel retained full security control over both sides of the border region as of Thursday.",
      "Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said two people were wounded by Israeli fire in Markaba, close to the border, without providing further details. It said Israel fired artillery in three other locations near the border. There were no immediate reports of casualties.",
      "While the detailed terms of the ceasefire agreement have not been made public by the U.S., President Biden made clear when he announced it on Tuesday that Israel retained the right to self-defense, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that any violations of the deal would be met with a swift and harsh military response.",
      "Israeli officials have said forces will be withdrawn gradually as it ensures that the agreement is being enforced. Israel has warned people repeatedly not to return to areas where troops are deployed, and says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah if it violates the terms of the truce.",
      "The ceasefire agreement announced late Tuesday ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that began a day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets, drones and missiles in solidarity. The Hamas attack saw the militants kill some 1,200 people in southern Israel and take 250 others hostage.",
      "Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict steadily intensified for nearly a year before boiling over into all-out war in mid-September. The war in Gaza is still raging with no end in sight, with health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory saying more than 44,280 people have been killed. Most of the enclave's 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, many of them forced to flee multiple times over the last year.",
      "More than 3,760 people were killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel, meanwhile, more than half of them civilians, as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon.",
      "Some 50,000 people were displaced on the Israeli side, but few have returned and the communities near the northern border are still largely deserted.",

      "Experts say a volley of tariffs between the U.S. and Canada could tip both countries into a recession and severely disrupt cross-border commerce between the key trading partners.",
      "A Canadian government official said Wednesday it is exploring potential retaliatory levies on certain U.S. imports after President-elect Donald Trump on Monday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. The official, who stressed no final decision has been taken, spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier this week also hinted that the country could retaliate against the U.S. with its own tariffs on American products. Trump said the stepped-up duties are necessary to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs from Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Blanket 25% tariffs on Canada threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week would push Canada into a recession in 2025, cause a sharp spike in inflation and force the Bank of Canada to hold rates higher next year,\" economist Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics said in a report Thursday.",
      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",
      "Canada fired back with duties of its own when Trump slapped tariffs on the country's steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. during his first stint in the White House. Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about an influx of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "U.S. also would feel the pain",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have said\u00a0tariffs deployed during his first term advanced U.S. economic aims, including boosting federal revenue, and didn't boost inflation.",
      "But the U.S. likely wouldn't go unscathed in a full-blown trade war with Canada. Across-the-board tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S. and fracture political relations between the allies, according to Oxford.",
      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, Canada supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied the tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With so much on the line, the incoming Trump administration is more likely to impose limited tariffs on Canadian products, such as steel, lumber and farm products like dairy.",
      "\"Despite Trump's latest threat of blanket tariffs, we still think it's unlikely that the Trump administration will put tariffs on Canadian autos and energy exports, which make up about 40% of total Canadian exports to the U.S.,\" Davenport said. \"The North American energy sector and auto supply chains are highly integrated across the U.S.-Canada border and any tariffs on these goods would also have a significant negative effect on the US economy.\"",

At that point, the hiker said he moved to a different location farther down into the valley and a built a camp and shelter in a dried-out creek bed. Eventually, Benastick found his way to the road where he encountered the Redfern Lake trail employees, well over six weeks after he first set out on his journey.",
      "\"Finding Sam alive is the absolute best outcome. After all the time he was missing, it was feared that this was would not be the outcome,\" said Corporal Madonna Saunderson, a spokesperson for the RCMP in British Columbia, in a statement.",

When he was found, the hiker was using two walking sticks to support himself and had cut his sleeping back to wrap the fabric around his legs for warmth, the Canadian broadcaster CBC News reported.

      "\"Add these things on a daily basis, and I promise this will help you gently get the bad stuff out and move you into a much healthier, stronger gut state,\" he said.",
      "1. Increase fiber intake",
      "Fiber is critical to digestive health, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"When we have more fiber-rich foods, it's like brushing the inner walls of our intestines \u2014 and that's going to help us remove the constipation and get to where we want to go,\" the doctor said.",

      "\"When you drink this on an empty stomach, it's going to go into all the little nooks and crannies of your gut \u2026 and it's going to help you start to detoxify and gently give you that \u2018internal shower\u2019 effect.\"",
      "2. Reduce inflammation",

      "\"Magnesium-rich powerhouses relax your intestinal muscles, soften stools and keep things moving, all while feeding your healthy gut bacteria.\" (iStock)",

      "\"It can also increase your happiness, improve your relationships and give you a boost in mental strength that you'll likely need during the day.\"",
      "2. Don\u2019t skip breakfast",
      "It might seem wise to forgo the meal leading up to Thanksgiving, with the idea of \"making room\" for the main food event, but experts say that\u2019s not a good idea.",
      "\"When you skip breakfast or lunch, you tend to be ravenous by the time you do eat, and that sets you up for overeating as you overindulge,\" Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Consumer Health Digest based in Wyoming, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Among the many options on the Thanksgiving table, some choices are better than others.",

      "Look for smart swaps",
      "Osborn recommended incorporating healthier versions of traditional foods whenever possible.",
      "\"For example, choose roasted vegetables instead of buttery casseroles or opt for turkey breast without gravy to reduce unnecessary fat,\" he suggested.",
      "Experts recommend choosing healthier versions of traditional foods whenever possible.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Remember, fat slows gastric emptying \u2013 it\u2019s why you feel full when you eat a fatty meal.\"",
      "When taking GLP-1 medications, gastric emptying is already slowed, Osborn noted, which means too much fat ingested in one sitting will cause nausea and potential vomiting.",
      "Opt for smaller portions",
      "The experts recommended doling out smaller portions of favorite dishes.",
      "\"You can enjoy traditional Thanksgiving dishes, but in much smaller quantities,\" Osborn said. \"Focus on a few bites of high-calorie dishes rather than full servings.\"",
      "Reierson agreed, adding, \"You can still enjoy all the variety and bounty of the meal without overeating.\"",
      "\"Listen to your body, and don\u2019t feel pressured to eat a whole plate if you\u2019re not hungry.\"",
      "Eat mindfully",
      "Overindulging while on GLP-1 medications can lead to nausea or discomfort, Osborn warned.",
      "\"Listen to your body, and don\u2019t feel pressured to eat a whole plate if you\u2019re not hungry,\" he said. \"It\u2019s OK to take small bites, chew slowly and savor the flavors.\"",
      "\"You can still enjoy all the variety and bounty of the meal without overeating,\" an expert said. (iStock)",
      "As these medications will help you feel full sooner, it\u2019s important to pay close attention to your body\u2019s signals, he noted.",
      "\"Remember, there is a delay between eating and one\u2019s perception of satiety,\" Osborn said. \"And this can hit you like a tidal wave if you\u2019re not careful.\"",
      "He added, \"Stop eating as soon as you feel satisfied, not stuffed.\"",
      "Plan for leftovers",
      "If you can\u2019t clear your plate in one sitting, simply pack it up and take it home.",
      "\"You can enjoy your favorite holiday dishes over several days, so there is no need to overeat during the meal,\" Reierson noted.",
      "Stay hydrated",
      "Hydration is important for everyone, but particularly those on GLP-1 medications.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Since \"GLP-1 medications can slow gastric emptying, dehydration can worsen side effects. Drink water throughout the day and shortly after your meals.\"",

      "\"Avoid the temptation to skip meals earlier in the day to \u2018save up\u2019 for the big meal,\" Reierson advised.",
      "\"This will often backfire and can lead to overeating and discomfort.\"",
      "Keep it simple and polite",
      "If someone comments on your small portion size, Osborn recommended keeping it \"simple and polite.\"",
      "You shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to explain your medication unless you\u2019re comfortable doing so, doctors said.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"You could say, \u2018I\u2019m not as hungry today, but everything looks amazing,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m focusing on smaller portions, as big meals make me feel lousy,\u2019\" he suggested.",

This could even spell problems for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., returning to the Speaker\u2019s suite. Johnson must win an outright majority of all House members voting when the new Congress convenes on January 3 to become Speaker. He\u2019ll have a bit of a cushion when the new Congress starts. But it won\u2019t be much. House Republicans still suffer from political PTSD after the 15 rounds it took to elect former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., early last year.",

      "The other special elections are months away because Stefanik and Waltz haven\u2019t resigned yet.

Kathy Hochul (D).",
      "The results in special elections sometimes produce \"special\" results. The usual electorate periodically stays home and the opposite party captures those seats in off-cycle elections. So, even though these are \"Republican\" seats, there\u2019s no guarantee that Republicans will automatically prevail.",
      "But if things go according to plan, Republicans will have those seats back in a few months, with a comparatively robust 220-215 majority. That means Republicans can lose up to two votes on any major issue.",

      "One factor which was a challenge for the GOP was the health of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. Scalise was diagnosed with cancer last year and was out the first part of 2023.

      "The letter, first reviewed by Reuters, comes as Ukraine has re-upped its request for NATO membership to help put an end to Russia's war, including a recent uptick in attacks on its energy infrastructure. It also comes as the Biden administration has granted Ukraine new permissions to fight back against Russia in their final months in office.",
      "In the letter, Ukraine's foreign minister acknowledged his country's ongoing war with Russia prohibits Kyiv from joining NATO right now. But he argued that an invitation for membership in Brussels would be a powerful show of force\u2014and a major symbolic blow\u2014to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long opposed the idea of their membership in NATO.",
      "\"We believe that the invitation should be extended at this stage,\" Sybiha said in the letter. \"It will become the Allies' adequate response to Russia's constant escalation of the war it has unleashed, the latest demonstration of which is the involvement of tens of thousands of North Korean troops and the use of Ukraine as a testing ground for new weapons,\" he added.",
      "Also on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used an interview on Sky News to up the public pressure for NATO leaders to extend his country a membership offer.",
      "Speaking Friday to Sky News's Stuart Ramsay, the Ukrainian president suggested that NATO could extend membership to the territory of Ukraine still under its control to help accelerate the NATO memberhsip process and wind down Russia's war as quickly as possible.",
      "\"If we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we need to take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control,\" he told Ramsay.

      "Imagine a gash in the Earth so large you could fit several football stadiums inside it. That's the Batagaika crater for you. This massive thermokarst depression \u2013 a fancy term for a giant permafrost-thaw sinkhole \u2013 is growing at an astonishing rate of 35 million cubic feet each year. To put that into perspective, it's like carving out a small town's worth of earth annually. Currently stretching about 0.6 miles long and 0.5 miles wide at its widest point, this behemoth shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it's speeding up, driven by a vicious cycle of warming temperatures and melting ice. This study was published in the\u00a0journal Geomorphology.",

      "Despite its name, permafrost isn't actually permanent. It's ground that's remained at or below freezing for at least two years. When this frozen soil thaws, it can't support the weight above it, leading to collapse and the formation of these massive \"slumps.\" The Batagaika crater is a prime example of this process in overdrive. As the permafrost melts, it exposes more soil to sunlight, which then melts more permafrost. It's a feedback loop that's difficult to break, especially in our warming world.",

      "While the sheer size of the Batagaika crater is impressive, what's truly mind-boggling is its depth, both physical and temporal. The steep walls of this mega-slump reveal permafrost layers estimated to be 650,000 years old. That's older than our species. But with ancient ice comes ancient dangers. Scientists have already revived a 48,500-year-old \"zombie virus\" from Arctic permafrost, and there's concern about what other long-dormant pathogens might be awakening. It's not just a plot from some sci-fi movie anymore. It's a real consideration for modern science and medicine.",

According to recent studies, this single mega-slump is responsible for releasing 4,000 to 5,000 tons of organic carbon every year. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of about 1,000 cars. This release of carbon, previously locked away in the frozen ground, further contributes to global warming, potentially accelerating the very process that created the crater in the first place.",

      "The Batagaika crater, while extreme, is not unique. It represents a process happening across the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. As our planet continues to warm, more of these massive permafrost thaw features are likely to appear. While some might see the crater as a tourist attraction \u2013 and indeed it has become one \u2013 it's crucial to recognize it as a warning sign. The \"Gateway to Hell\" is more than just a catchy nickname; it's a portal into a possible future where rapid environmental changes reshape our world in ways we're only beginning to understand. The question remains: Will we heed the warning signs and take action, or will we continue to watch as more gateways open across our warming world?",

      "In the 1930s, there were around 6.8 million farms in the United States. The size averaged at around 155 acres. Over the next several decades, the number of farms rapidly declined to around 1.9 million in 2023. Those farms grew larger, averaging around 464 acres.",

      "The most recent data shows 41% of farmers reported labor shortages in 2018. That\u2019s a 27% increase from those reporting shortages in 2014. The trend is expected to continue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 2% decline in workers through 2033 despite the number of job openings remaining the same.",
      "\"We do more with less. It's not that it has no set way and has totally changed the traditional work, it is empowering, and it is increasing the productivity of existing workers,\" said Ilias Tagkopoulos, a computer science professor at UC Davis and the director of AIFS.",

Whether that has to do with production of different types of vegetables, fruits, nuts, other types of meats or other types of foods,\" Earles said. \"There\u2019s a lot of potential, we think, all the way from going from the research and lab side through startups, through corporate innovation. And we're here to kind of find a way to facilitate and integrate that along the way.\"",

And the consumer sees better fruit, veggies and other products that are coming out of those fields,\" Earles said.",

      "These keywords are designed to align with popular search terms. Since Spotify\u2019s web player pages are indexed by search engines like Google, these spammy results appear in user searches, driving traffic to their links. For example, a Spotify playlist titled \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\u2026\" was found promoting \"free\" software sites in its title and description, directing users to questionable external links.",
      "The scam isn\u2019t limited to playlists. It extends to podcasts as well. Scammers create podcasts with multiple short episodes, typically under 20 seconds, using synthesized speech to direct listeners to click links in the description for free content. These podcasts often target users searching for pirated ebooks, audiobooks or game cheats.

      "2. Stick to official sources: Always download software, eBooks or other digital content from trusted official websites or reputable platforms. If you see a Spotify playlist or podcast offering \"free\" versions of paid content, it\u2019s likely a scam. Cross-check the legitimacy of the content through known channels instead of relying on unverified links.",

      "3. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex and unique passwords for your Spotify account and avoid using personal information like birthdays or pet names. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Be skeptical of synthesized speech and short episodes: Many scam podcasts feature short episodes (10-20 seconds) with synthesized speech directing you to click on a link in the description. These are a common tactic used to trick users into visiting unsafe pages. If the content feels automated, vague or overly promotional, it\u2019s best to avoid it.",
      "5. Verify curator credentials: Check the credentials of playlist curators. Legitimate curators usually have a verifiable online presence. If you can't find any information about them, it's best to avoid engaging with them.",
      "6. Recognize phishing attempts: Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Spotify that ask you to confirm account details or click on suspicious links. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials.",
      "7. Report and block suspicious content: If you come across playlists or podcasts that seem fraudulent or inappropriate,\u00a0report them directly to Spotify. Use Spotify\u2019s reporting tools to flag content that violates its platform rules. Blocking suspicious accounts or playlists also ensures you won\u2019t accidentally interact with them in the future, and reporting helps Spotify improve its filtering and moderation systems.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers will use any means possible to trick you. In the past, we\u2019ve seen bad actors weaponize\u00a0Google search results with malicious websites that install malware when links are clicked on. There have also been plenty of\u00a0SEO scams targeting users. Companies like Spotify need to implement measures to prevent their platforms from being misused by scammers. Google also has a responsibility to ensure the quality of its search results. Just because a webpage comes from a well-known organization doesn\u2019t mean it deserves to rank highly on the search results pages.",

      "With the holiday season just around the corner, many of us are gearing up to spread some cheer with gift cards.",
      "However, it\u2019s important to remember that these convenient gifts are also a favorite target for scammers. We're going to break down six sneaky gift card tricks that could leave you out of pocket during this time of year.",

      "Image of a holiday gift card (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1. Display rack gift card trick",
      "One of the latest gift card tricks involves tampering with the gift cards on the display racks at retail stores. Scammers will record the activation code on the card or place a custom barcode sticker over the real barcode, which allows them to secretly load the cash onto their own card immediately after you purchase the gift card. This means that when you or your recipient try to use the gift card, it will be empty or invalid.",
      "Check the packaging of the gift card before buying it. Look for signs of tampering, such as the wrapping being torn or resealed or stickers placed over the barcode or card number. Also, choose a card from the back of the rack, as scammers often place their fraudulent cards at the front of the display.",

      "2. Impersonation gift card trick",
      "Another common gift card trick scammers use involves impersonating someone you know or trust, such as a family member, a romantic interest, a company or the government. Scammers will contact you by phone, text, email or social media and create a fake story or emergency that requires you to send them money urgently.",
      "They will ask you to buy a gift card or multiple gift cards and then send them a photo of the card or the numbers on the back of the card. Once they have the gift card information, they will disappear with your money and cut off contact.",
      "Never send money or gift cards to anyone you don\u2019t know personally or haven\u2019t met in person. If someone claims to be someone you know or trust, verify their identity by contacting them directly through a different channel.",
      "Don\u2019t trust caller ID, as scammers can spoof phone numbers. Don\u2019t be pressured by threats or promises, as scammers use emotional manipulation to get you to act quickly and without thinking. And remember, no legitimate company or government agency will ever ask you to pay them with a gift card.",

      "3. Resale gift card trick",
      "Another gift card trick involves buying or selling gift cards on online platforms, such as websites, apps or social media groups. Scammers will offer to sell you gift cards at a discounted price or buy your unwanted gift cards for cash.",
      "However, they will either send you a fake or empty gift card or take your gift card information and money without sending you anything in return. They may also use stolen credit cards or hacked accounts to buy or sell gift cards, which can put you at risk of fraud or identity theft.",
      "Only buy or sell gift cards from reputable sources, such as official retailers, authorized resellers or trusted friends and family. Avoid buying or selling gift cards from strangers online, especially if they offer a deal that sounds too good to be true.",
      "Don\u2019t share your gift card information or personal details with anyone you don\u2019t know or trust. And use a secure payment method that offers protection, such as a credit card or PayPal, instead of a gift card, wire transfer or cash.",

      "4. Phishing gift card trick",
      "A very popular gift card trick this holiday season\u00a0involves phishing, which is a type of online fraud that tries to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information. Scammers will send you an email, text or pop-up message that looks like it comes from a legitimate company, such as a retailer, bank or\u00a0tech support service.",
      "They will claim that there is a problem with your account, your order, your device or your security and that you need to verify your identity, update your information or fix an issue. They will then ask you to click on a link, open an attachment or call a number and then request that you pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "Never click on links, open attachments or call numbers from unsolicited messages, as they may lead to fake or malicious websites or software. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, PINs, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of urgency, pressure or fear, as they are designed to make you act without thinking. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the company directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "Using antivirus protection will help to protect you against scammers and hackers who try to steal your money and personal information using gift card tricks, especially\u00a0through phishing. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links, fake websites, phishing emails and text messages is to have strong\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices. It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",

      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5. Loyalty program gift card trick",
      "This gift card trick involves loyalty programs, which are rewards programs that offer you points, discounts or freebies for being a loyal customer. Scammers will pretend to be representatives of a loyalty program that you are a member of or that you are eligible to join.",
      "They will tell you that you have won a prize, sweepstakes or a promotion and that you need to pay a fee, a tax or a shipping cost to claim it. They will then ask you to pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Be wary of any unsolicited offers or notifications that claim that you have won something, especially if you don\u2019t remember entering or signing up for anything. Don\u2019t pay any money or fees to receive a prize, as legitimate loyalty programs will never ask you to do that. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of excitement, curiosity or greed, as they are designed to make you act impulsively. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the loyalty program directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6. Fake balance checker scam",
      "In this scam, fraudsters set up fake websites or phone services that claim to check the balance of your gift cards. Victims are lured into providing their gift card numbers and PINs under the guise of verifying their balance. Once the information is entered, scammers can drain the funds from the card almost immediately.",
      "To avoid this scam, always use official websites or apps from reputable retailers to check your gift card balance. Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages asking for your gift card information, especially if they claim to be from a legitimate company. It is important never to enter your gift card details on unfamiliar websites.",

      "How to safely give and receive gift cards",
      "Buy gift cards online instead of physical cards directly from the store, not from third parties.\u00a0You can also use\u00a0these favorite sites and apps that will reward you with a percentage back on all gift card purchases.Avoid gift card racks at retail stores like the grocery store.

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson explains how to safeguard retirement accounts from cyber threats with a VPN: encryption, anonymity, secure access.",
      "Protecting your financial future goes beyond smart investing and saving. It's crucial to safeguard your retirement accounts from cyber threats. While many believe that using\u00a0public Wi-Fi to check their 401(k) or IRA is harmless, the reality is that without proper protection, you could be putting your hard-earned savings at risk. Let's explore why using a VPN (virtual private network) is essential for securing your retirement accounts and how you can implement this extra layer of security.",
      "1 WEEK LEFT!\u00a0I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her tablet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "When you access your retirement accounts online, especially through public Wi-Fi networks, you're potentially exposing sensitive financial information to cybercriminals. These hackers can intercept your data, steal your login credentials and potentially drain your accounts. What's more concerning is that retirement accounts are often less frequently monitored than regular bank accounts, making them an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone and a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR PCS, MACS, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2013 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Why a VPN is crucial for protecting your retirement accounts",
      "By creating an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, a VPN makes it extremely difficult for hackers to intercept your sensitive data. Here's a deeper look at why VPNs are indispensable for safeguarding your retirement accounts:",
      "VPNs employ military-grade encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to scramble your data. This means that even if a cybercriminal manages to intercept your information, it would appear as an indecipherable jumble of characters. For your retirement accounts, this translates to an extra layer of security for your login credentials, account numbers and financial transactions.",
      "By masking your IP address and replacing it with one from their servers, VPNs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to track your online activities. This anonymity is crucial when accessing financial accounts, as it prevents cybercriminals from identifying you as a high-value target based on your browsing habits or the financial institutions you visit online.",
      "The ability to check your accounts while traveling or using\u00a0public Wi-Fi is convenient but risky. A VPN provides a secure connection, essentially creating a protected tunnel between your device and the financial institution's servers. This is particularly important for retirement accounts, which may not have the same level of fraud protection as checking or savings accounts.\u00a0However, check if your retirement fund platform permits VPN usage, as some might flag it as unusual activity.",
      "VPNs are excellent safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, where hackers position themselves between you and the website you're trying to access. By encrypting your data from end to end, VPNs make it nearly impossible for attackers to insert themselves into your connection and steal your information.",
      "If you're traveling abroad and need to access your U.S.-based retirement accounts, some financial institutions may block access from foreign IP addresses. A VPN allows you to connect through a U.S.-based server, ensuring you can manage your accounts securely from anywhere in the world.",

      "2) Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5) Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6) Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up to date with the latest security patches.",
      "7) Be wary of phishing attempts: Don't click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Remember, the small investment in a quality VPN service is negligible compared to the potential losses from a compromised retirement account.",

      "This malware hides in seemingly harmless applications, such as a game called Minesweeper and a note-taking app referred to as a Notepad. These apps function as expected, but behind the scenes, they run malicious programs that could allow hackers to take control of your computer.",
      "The apps use a technology called Flutter, a tool often used to create apps that work on multiple devices like phones and computers. Flutter makes it easier for app developers to design their software, but its unique structure also helps hackers hide their malicious code, making it harder for experts to detect.",
      "Once installed, the malware connects to a remote server (think of it as a command center for hackers) to receive instructions. These instructions could include running commands on your computer without your knowledge. One trick this malware uses is running AppleScripts, a type of script built for macOS systems, which can quietly execute commands to steal your data or even control your device.",

      "2) Be careful with downloads and links:\u00a0Only download apps from trusted sources like the Mac App Store or official websites of known developers. Hackers often disguise malware as legitimate updates or harmless apps.",
      "3) Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular updates for macOS and installed apps are essential because they patch security flaws. Apple frequently rolls out updates to address vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates ensures you stay protected without the hassle of manually checking for them.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0A strong password can help keep your Mac safe from unauthorized access. Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here\u2014it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches.

It just shows that no device is completely safe, not even one made by Apple. Hackers, including those backed by North Korea, are constantly finding new ways to trick users into downloading malicious software. These attacks often fly under the radar because they look like regular, safe apps. With these threats becoming more sophisticated, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay aware of the risks and be cautious about what you download and click on.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Stanford University \"misinformation expert\" has been accused of using artificial intelligence (AI) to craft testimony later used by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a politically-charged case.",
      "Jeff Hancock, a professor of communications and founder of the vaunted school's Social Media Lab, provided an expert declaration in a case involving a satirical conservative YouTuber named Christopher Kohls. The court case is about Minnesota's recent ban on political\u00a0deepfakes, which the plaintiffs argue is an attack on free speech.",
      "Hancock's testimony was submitted to the court by Ellison, who is arguing in favor of the law. Hancock is \"well-known for his research on how people use deception with technology, from sending texts and emails to detecting fake online reviews,\" according to Stanford's website.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "A Stanford professor is accused of using an AI language model to write an expert declaration. (Getty Images)",
      "\"[The] Declaration of Prof. Jeff Hancock cites a study that does not exist,\" lawyers argued in a recent 36-page memo. \"No article by the title exists.\"",
      "The \"study\" was called \"The Influence of Deepfake Videos on Political Attitudes and Behavior\" and was purportedly published in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics. The Nov. 16 filing notes that the journal is authentic, but had never published a study by that name.",
      "\"The publication exists, but the cited pages belong to unrelated articles,\" the lawyers argued. \"Likely, the study was a \u2018hallucination\u2019 generated by an AI large language model like ChatGPT.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs do not know how this hallucination wound up in Hancock\u2019s declaration, but it calls the entire document into question, especially when much of the commentary contains no methodology or analytic logic whatsoever.\"",
      "The document also calls out Ellison, arguing that \"the conclusions that Ellison most relies on have no methodology behind them and consist entirely of expert say-so.\"",
      "\"Hancock could have cited a real study similar to the proposition in paragraph 21,\" the memo states. \"But the existence of a fictional citation Hancock (or his assistants) didn\u2019t even bother to click calls into question the quality and veracity of the entire declaration.\"",

      "The memorandum also doubles down on the claim that the citation is bogus, noting the multiple searches lawyers went through to try to locate the study.",
      "\"The title of the alleged article, and even a snippet of it, does not appear on anywhere on the internet as indexed by Google and Bing, the most commonly-used search engines,\" the document states. \"Searching Google Scholar, a specialized search engine for academic papers and patent publications, reveals no articles matching the description of the citation authored by \u2018Hwang\u2019 [the purported author] that includes the term \u2018deepfake.\u2019\"",
      "\"Perhaps this was simply a copy-paste error? It\u2019s not,\" the filing later flatly states. \"The article doesn\u2019t exist.\"",
      "The attorneys concluded that, if the declaration were partially fabricated, it is entirely unreliable and should be dismissed from court consideration.",
      "\"The declaration of Prof. Hancock should be excluded in its entirety because at least some of it is based on fabricated material likely generated by an AI model, which calls into question its conclusory assertions,\" the document concluded. \"The court may inquire into the source of the fabrication and additional action may be warranted.\"",

One of the most significant benefits is enhanced encryption, which provides better protection for your communications. Unlike many free services that collect and sell user data to third parties, privacy-focused providers do not engage in such practices.

Once you have made your selection, create an account with your chosen service; many offer a free tier to get started. After setting up your account, it is essential to enable encryption by following the provider's instructions.",
      "Next, you can import any existing emails from your old account using the provider's import tool. Informing your contacts about your new email address is also important to ensure seamless communication moving forward.

Of those heists, she said, 30% take place on Black Friday, 16% take place on Christmas Day, 14% take place on Christmas Eve; and 11% take place on Cyber Monday.",

      "1. E-shop scams",

      "\"It's very easy to create a fake e-shop that looks really realistic. The look and feel is amazing. You won't be able to spot it really easily. So even us, sometimes we struggle to figure out if something is real or not,\" Bilge said. \"You have to think twice with scams because they're really complicated and sophisticated now, especially with AI. Things are becoming much more powerful.\"",
      "But common sense, new tools and a few tactics can be used to spot them.",
      "One sign that an online retailer might be fake is that their deals are \"too good to be true.\"",
      "\"If something is sold for, let's say, $100, you're not going to get it for $10,\" Bilge said. \"So it's not you're never going to have [a] 90% decrease discount, but typically, you get these kind of crazy discounts on such websites.\"",

      "\"Let's say that [the fake e-shop] might be an Amazon imitation,\" she said. \"You might want to go and check whether the website's name actually fits the brand, because let's say you would have Amazon.com, [their website could be] Amazonbeautifulverycool.com, something like this.\"",
      "Paying attention before capitalizing on an attractive deal could save your wallet and private information, she said, and so can looking into the seller itself if you've never shopped there before.",
      "\"You might want to be really careful and cross-check with third-party organizations that are actually kind of providing reviews about our organizations,\" Bilge said. \"We actually have an AI-powered chatbot, which we call Norton Genie, that a user can easily just cross-check.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Ireland is voting Friday in a parliamentary election that will decide the next government \u2014 and will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures.",
      "Polls opened at 7 a.m.. (0700GMT), and Ireland\u2019s 3.8 million voters are selecting 174 lawmakers to sit in the Dail, the lower house of parliament.",
      "2,000-YEAR-OLD FIG UNEARTHED IN IRELAND MARKS \u2018OLDEST EXAMPLE OF AN EXOTIC FRUIT\u2019 DISCOVERED IN THE AREA",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the parties, the issues and the likely outcome.",
      "Who\u2019s running?",
      "The outgoing government was led by the two parties who have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war.",
      "After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister. Fianna Fail leader Miche\u00e1l Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael\u2019s Leo Varadkar in December 2022. Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down in March, passing the job to current Taoiseach Simon Harris.",
      "Opposition party Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "Under Ireland\u2019s system of proportional representation, each of the 43 constituencies elects multiple lawmakers, with voters ranking their preferences. That makes it relatively easy for smaller parties and independent candidates with a strong local following to gain seats.",
      "Presiding officer Caroline Sharkey and Garda Ronan Steede look after a ballot box that is taken by boat to the Island of Gola as voters go to polls the for the 2024 General Election in Ireland, Friday, Nov. 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Morrison)",
      "This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry \"the Monk\" Hutch.",
      "What are the main issues?",
      "As in many other countries, the cost of living \u2014 especially housing \u2014 has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country\u2019s \"Celtic Tiger\" boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis.",
      "\"There was not building during the crisis, and when the crisis receded, offices and hotels were built first,\" said John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Threshold.",
      "The result is soaring house prices, rising rents and growing homelessness.",
      "After a decade of economic growth, McCafferty said \"Ireland has resources\" \u2014 not least 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in back taxes the European Union has ordered Apple to pay it \u2014 \"but it is trying to address big historic infrastructural deficits.\"",
      "Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades.",
      "Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies.",
      "What\u2019s the likely outcome?",
      "Opinion polls suggest voters\u2019 support is split into five roughly even chunks \u2014 for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents.",
      "Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum, but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it.",
      "Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers.",
      "\"It\u2019s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,\" said Eoin O\u2019Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. \"Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.\"",
      "When will we know the results?",
      "Polls close Friday at 10 p.m. (2200GMT), when an exit poll will give the first hints about the result. Counting ballots begins on Saturday morning. Full results could take several days, and forming a government days or weeks after that.",

      "Amos Hochstein, special presidential coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Energy Security, says the Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire agreement is comprehensive on 'Your World.'",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Amid the start of a cease-fire on Wednesday between Israel and the Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah terrorist movement in Lebanon, some leading Republican lawmakers accused President Biden of browbeating Israel into a temporary suspension of the war as the Jewish state staged a near-takedown of the terror group's leadership and military structure.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reached the Litani River in Lebanon on Tuesday. A key war goal for the IDF is to push Hezbollah forces north of the Litani River. Under the\u00a0cease-fire deal, Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border.",

      "\"The cease-fire agreement does not diminish what Israel managed to achieve in short order against Hezbollah. Within two months, it dismantled its infrastructure along the border, decapitated its entire senior command structure, destroyed a large percentage of its arsenal, and killed and injured thousands of its fighters,\" Tony Badran Levant, analyst and news editor at Tablet Magazine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Describing the move by former officials from the Obama administration who now work in the Biden administration, he said, \"What the Obama-Biden team did on their way out was to coerce the Israelis, reportedly with the threat of an arms embargo at the Security Council, into signing onto Obama\u2019s vision for the U.S. role in Lebanon, which is part of his broader pro-Iran realignment. This is the downside of the agreement: it consolidates this Obama framework that should have been dismantled \u2014 and that\u2019s separate from the tactical and strategic gains that Israel achieved on the battlefield. Rather, this pertains to U.S. policy and how the Obama-Biden team used Israel to lock in their regional preferences.\"",
      "He continued, \"The deal puts the incoming Trump administration and the Israelis in a weird situation, not just because it saddles the new administration with Obama\u2019s preferences in Lebanon \u2014 including hundreds of millions in additional aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces \u2014 but also it makes the U.S. an arbiter for Israeli action against Hezbollah moving forward and the possibility for friction that may create between the Trump administration and Israel.",
      "U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein speaks during a press conference after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut on March 4. (Reuters/Mohamed Azakir/File Photo)",
      "\"Meanwhile, the Obama-Biden team have set their structure in place. If the incoming administration keeps it, that would be great for the Democrats, who will pick it up on the other end and expand on it. In any case, they have a document \u2014 a bilateral side agreement \u2014 that will be there for a future Democratic administration,\" he warned.",
      "Amos Hochstein, the presidential envoy who brokered the deal, told Israel's Channel 12 evening news anchor Yonit Levi that he had informed President-elect Trump's team about the tenets of the deal \"because it's very important for them to understand and support it, because they are going to have to carry it forward and implement as they took office in just a few weeks.\"",
      "Echoing Badran's warning, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., noted in a statement that \"I am deeply disturbed both by reports that Obama-Biden officials exerted enormous pressure on our Israeli allies to accept this cease-fire and by how those officials are characterizing Israel's obligations. This pressure and these statements are further efforts to undermine Israel and constrain the incoming Trump administration. Obama-Biden officials pressured our Israeli allies into accepting the cease-fire by withholding weapons they needed to defend themselves and counter Hezbollah, and by threatening to facilitate a further, broader, binding international arms embargo through the United Nations.\"",

It's only that we didn't threaten it\u2026 literally the topic never came up, so, I don't even know how to answer the question any other way. It is completely new to me. And none of us has heard of this before.\"",
      "Backing this up in his interview with Israel's Ch. 12, Hochstein also denied the Biden administration threatened Israel over use of its U.N. Security Council veto if it did not sign the deal, saying, \"There was no such discussion at any point,\" adding that \"it never came up.\"",

      "The 13-year civil war in Syria has roared back into prominence\u00a0with a surprise rebel offensive\u00a0on Aleppo, one of Syria\u2019s largest cities and an ancient business hub. The push is among the rebels\u2019 strongest in years in a war whose destabilizing effects have rippled far beyond the country\u2019s borders.",
      "It was the first opposition attack on Aleppo since 2016, when a brutal air campaign by Russian warplanes helped Syrian President Bashar Assad retake the northwestern city. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power, within the 70% of Syria under his control.",
      "The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East, at a time when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups.",
      "Robert Ford, the last-serving U.S. ambassador to Syria, pointed to months of Israeli strikes on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in the area, and to Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon this week, as factors providing Syria\u2019s rebels with the opportunity to advance.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the key aspects of the new fighting:",
      "Why does it matter?",
      "Assad has been at war with opposition forces seeking his overthrow for 13 years, a conflict that\u2019s killed an estimated half-million people. Some 6.8 million Syrians have fled the country, a refugee flow that helped change the political map in Europe by fueling anti-immigrant far-right movements.",
      "The roughly 30% of the country not under Assad is controlled by a range of opposition forces and foreign troops. The U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, far from Aleppo, to guard against a resurgence by the Islamic State. Both the U.S. and Israel conduct occasional strikes in Syria against government forces and Iran-allied militias. Turkey has forces in Syria as well, and has influence with the broad alliance of opposition forces storming Aleppo."

Four years ago, a ceasefire brought an end to the most intense violence, but the new push from rebels has upended a period of relative calm.",

    "summary": "Indiginous AI",
    "story": [
      "Indigenous researchers are up against a ticking clock: Of the 4,000 Indigenous languages worldwide, one dies every two weeks with its last speaker. \u201cWithin the next five to 10 years, we\u2019ll lose most of the Native American languages in the U.S.,\u201d Michael Running Wolf, founder of Indigenous in AI, an international community of Native, Aboriginal and First Nations engineers, said.",
      "Running Wolf has dedicated his career to preventing this loss. He leads First Languages AI Reality, an initiative of the Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, where researchers are building speech recognition models for over 200 endangered Indigenous languages in North America.",
      "However, first, he must overcome a major roadblock: There aren\u2019t enough Indigenous computer scientist graduates \u2014 people who know the language and culture \u2014 to tackle these language preservation projects. Running Wolf emphasized that Indigenous scientists know to respect the data itself. \u201cThe core data we use isn\u2019t just tweets or social media posts; it\u2019s deeply culturally identifying information from speakers who may have passed away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that the community is always retaining their relationship to the data.\u201d",
      "Running Wolf said that in his years of artificial intelligence research, he\u2019s only come across about a dozen Indigenous North American AI scientists. \u201cWe only graduate one or two Indigenous Ph.D.s in AI and computer science every year,\u201d he said.",
      "Indigenous people make up less than 0.005% of the tech workforce in the U.S., hold only 0.4% of bachelor\u2019s degrees in computer science every year and have one board member at the top 200 tech companies. In 2022, Native-founded companies only received a mere 0.02% of total venture capital funding.",
      "That\u2019s where the handful of Indigenous engineers who do exist come in: They are leading organizations like First Languages AI Reality, IndigiGenius, Tech Natives and the Wihanble S\u2019a Center for Indigenous AI to train Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian computer science students to preserve Indigenous culture and language.",
      "\u201cTraditionally, AI assumes that data is proprietary, and that can be harmful for Indigenous communities,\u201d Running Wolf said. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that we can succeed in our mission of reclaiming Indigenous languages ethically with ethical AI protocols.\u201d",
      "Building the Indigenous-tech pipeline",
      "Kyra Kaya is one of the dozens of beneficiaries of the tech training program Tech Natives, an organization of Indigenous women in tech that offers mentorship and recruitment opportunities on college campuses. Studying computer science at Yale University, Kaya was inspired to build an AI tool that would honor her Native Hawaiian grandmother, with whom she spent summers in Maui. \u201cI realized many Native Hawaiians don\u2019t have access to technology that many people take for granted,\u201d the 20-year-old said.",
      "She fed the tool Hawaiian Pidgin English, a heavily stigmatized English-based creole language used by many Hawaii residents, and trained it to recognize spoken phrases. \u201cI wanted to change the narrative around pidgin as a \u2018lesser language,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI input phrases that my grandmother, aunties and mother used and got it to identify them.\u201d",
      "Kaya hopes to turn her work into an app accessible to other Hawaii locals. \u201cAI and the tech industry have the power to either uplift or silence marginalized groups like mine,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Indigenous people can and should play a large role in it.\u201d",
      "Researchers say getting more Indigenous people into the tech industry begins with piquing their interest at a young age. In South Dakota every summer, IndigiGenius\u2019 Lakota AI Code Camp brings together Native teens for three weeks to design an app that documents the Lakota culture, including sacred plants and everyday Lakota words. Since its launch in 2022, the code camp has trained 33 students to contribute to the app, many of whom have returned as instructors or pursued other computer science projects.",
      "To continue tech education throughout the school year, IndigiGenius has also launched T3PD, training a group of 20 mostly Native high school teachers across the country to develop culturally relevant computer science courses at their schools. Only 67% of Native students have access to a computer science course, lower than any other student demographic, and the organization is partnering with teachers to bring laptops and computer science classes to their students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about making AI education culturally relevant for students,\u201d IndigiGenius Executive Director Andrea Delgado-Olson said. \u201cWhat sets us apart is how we\u2019re utilizing Indigenous knowledge to bridge technology with our traditions.\u201d",
      "Preserving other aspects of Indigenous culture with AI",
      "AI is also helping to fill Indigenous cultural gaps beyond language. As a child, Madeline Gupta seldom visited her Chippewa lands. But as she grew older, the call to return to her ancestral lands grew stronger. \u201cI had this feeling that I belonged on that land, that my ancestors wanted me there,\u201d Gupta said.",
      "She said that after the government tore tribal members away from their land and their families from 1819 to 1969, many were disconnected from their roots. \u201cMy tribe has about 50,000 people, but only 2,000 of them live on the reservation,\u201d the 21-year-old Yale student said. \u201cThat means thousands of students haven\u2019t seen their own lands.\u201d",
      "In college, Gupta joined the Tech Natives program and proposed an immersive virtual reality experience for Native youth to \u201cvisit\u201d their traditional lands in the Great Lakes region. After securing funding from the Aspen Institute and the Yale School of Medicine, Gupta traveled to Mackinac Island this past summer to film and record stories from tribal elders, capturing 3D spatial video on her phone, then recording the audio stories to accompany it. She hopes to create a virtual reality map of the island that users can click into to view videos related to the area.",
      "\u201cI want to reach people who don\u2019t currently feel connected to the land or don\u2019t know our stories,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to cultural preservation, artists are also using artificial intelligence in their creative practices. Suzanne Kite at Bard College\u2019s Wihanble S\u2019a Center for Indigenous AI describes herself as one of the first American Indian artists to use machine learning in art. \u201cMy question is simple: How do we create ethical art with AI by applying Indigenous ontologies?\u201d she said.",
      "Kite dug into the Lakota dream language to process the knowledge that her family received through their dreams from spirits and animals. She spent three months last year recording all of her dreams, then used machine learning to translate the contents into a Lakota women\u2019s geometric language commonly used in beadwork and quiltwork. She also turned her dreams into a graphic score for the American Composers Orchestra. \u201cI try to resist Western personification of AI and instead dig into the hyperlocal, grounded and practical frameworks of knowledge that American Indigenous communities provide,\u201d Kite said.",
      "While many of these Indigenous AI projects are in their early stages, Running Wolf hopes programs like his will be irrelevant in a decade or two. His dream is to revive dying languages and enable new generations of Native speakers to create ethical tech. \u201cI hope this technology will be remembered as an artifact of a troubled time,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely crazy during the holiday season,\u201d she said.",
      "Even so, Sonday, 25, of Lincoln, Nebraska, prefers retail to a job that would put her animal science degree to use. She makes around $30,000 a year at Target and has a social media side hustle that pulls in extra income, but Sonday likes retail and thinks more people should get some experience in the industry.",
      "\u201cYou are truly helping people directly,\u201d she said.",
      "Primary source of income: Sonday\u2019s hours fluctuate, but she normally works around 35 hours a week making $16.50 an hour, up from her starting pay of $11 an hour. That\u2019s well above the state\u2019s $12 hourly minimum but beneath the $19.71 that MIT researchers calculate as a \u201cliving wage\u201d for a single, childless adult in Lincoln\u2019s Lancaster County.",
      "Sonday isn\u2019t allowed to work overtime, so she doesn\u2019t clock more than 40 hours per week. But she pulls in additional earnings as a social media influencer, drawing on her day job. About three years ago, Sonday started posting on TikTok about working at Target and has since gained a following of over 70,000.",
      "Her posts range from tips about Target products to social media strategy and budgeting. Brands like Skims, EOS and Rare Beauty have taken notice and sent her packages of goods to promote.",
      "Sonday estimated she made about $35,000 from social media in her first year. While that side-gig income has ranged widely more recently, it typically adds up to about $10,000 annually, helping her cover bills more comfortably and pad her savings, which she\u2019s built up to about $20,000.",
      "Living situation: Sonday can say something many young people can\u2019t: She\u2019s a homeowner. She bought her two-bedroom property in 2021 for $205,000 with assistance from NeighborWorks, a community housing development nonprofit. The aid included a $10,000 loan for her down payment and $15,000 for repairs with no interest, and she\u2019ll only have to pay it back if she sells the house within 10 years.",
      "Sonday lives with one roommate who rents from her for $580, which Sonday puts toward her $1,400 monthly payments on a 30-year fixed mortgage with a 6.38% interest rate.",
      "Her utilities usually range from $60 to $100 per month, with her phone bill costing an additional $60 and Wi-Fi another $30. She estimates spending about $70 each month on gas, with a gallon of regular hovering around $2.83 in her area, about 23 cents below the national average.",
      "Sonday\u2019s other roommate is her dog, Winston, a playful golden retriever who eats about $30 in food every month.",
      "Economic outlook: Sonday pulls in less than the annual median household income in Lancaster County, which was about $70,000 in 2022, the latest year for which federal data is available. But she\u2019s relatively comfortable all the same.",
      "\u201cI know how to manage,\u201d Sonday said. \u201cI know how to allocate money well, so then I can still enjoy things in life.\u201d",
      "Target\u2019s employee discounts help keep down her weekly costs, shaving 10% off her grocery purchases at the store and an additional 20% on certain healthy options like fruits and vegetables. She has been driving the same 2011 Hyundai Elantra, which her mother bought for her, since she was 16.",
      "\u201cThat has helped me achieve what I have \u2014 by holding off and focusing on other financial goals in my life versus wanting a newer car,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, Sonday has found herself paying more attention to day-to-day costs lately, even as inflation cools down. \u201cSeeing how expensive everything is in general, you have to really think about, \u2018What do I want to spend my money on? What\u2019s worth it?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Sticking with retail: Sonday was raised by a single mother, who used to work at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, which Sonday attended at a discounted rate. As a result, she didn\u2019t have to take out any student loans, graduating in 2020 with a degree in animal science, having also minored in business.",
      "Just because you work in retail doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the end goal. And if retail works for you, that\u2019s OK, too.",
      "Kaitlin Sonday, Lincoln, Neb.",
      "But many jobs working with animals don\u2019t pay well, Sonday said, unless they\u2019re science-heavy or accompanied by graduate degrees. (For example, veterinary technicians, who typically have associate degrees, make an average of $19 an hour in the Lincoln area, according to ZipRecruiter.)",
      "She has considered ways to make use of her B.A., but being \u201cnot as much the science girl,\u201d Sonday became more keen on social media marketing in college. And combining her Target job with her TikTok side gig gives her a creative outlet.",
      "Sonday works mainly in the store\u2019s beauty section, but her shifts increasingly involve fulfilling pickup orders. That can require searching backstocks and truck deliveries for items purchased online. \u201cIt is more like a daily thing, even though that isn\u2019t my specific work area,\u201d she said.",
      "The rise of online orders has also made predicting staffing levels difficult, and the store can feel understaffed during the holidays, she said. Sonday said she often jumps in to help co-workers, especially those running out curbside pickup orders in the cold.",
      "\u201cTarget\u2019s team members are at the heart of making Target a great place to shop \u2014 during the holidays and year-round,\u201d spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo said in a statement. \u201cMost store team members are trained to work in our Drive Up area because, like check-out, we aim to help our guests quickly receive their orders, even during peak hours. We know our teams work hard, and their flexibility and dedication to our guests are greatly appreciated.\u201d",
      "Despite periodic challenges, Sonday has no immediate plans for a career change. After starting at Target part-time while still in college, she developed close friendships there. She also said she\u2019s learned a lot about the business and doesn\u2019t view retail as a \u201cdead end job.\u201d",
      "It gives her great flexibility, too; since starting at Target, she\u2019s taken six weeks off to travel to Italy \u2014 twice.",
      "\u201cJust because you work in retail doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the end goal,\u201d Sonday said. \u201cAnd if retail works for you, that\u2019s OK, too. You don\u2019t always have to be chasing some type of goal that society has given everyone.\u201d",

      "A New York woman whose grandparents went missing 44 years ago said on Friday their disappearance haunted her for decades, but the recent discovery of what could be their car submerged in a Georgia pond has her family believing the mystery may soon be solved.",
      "\u201cI never went a day without worrying or thinking about if they had a terrible ending to their life,\u201d Christine Heller Seaman, 60, of Manhattan, said about her grandmother Catherine Romer, who was married to Charles Romer. The couple was reported missing in April 1980.",
      "\u201cFor years and years, we didn\u2019t hear anything. \u2026 It\u2019s something that you held with you every single day of your life \u2026 if they were tortured or harmed,\u201d Seaman told NBC News on Friday in a phone call.",
      "Charles Romer, a retired oil executive, and his wife, vanished along with their 1978 Lincoln Continental while traveling home from Miami Beach, Florida. At the time, law enforcement expressed concerns about potential foul play against the couple from Scarsdale, New York, partly because Catherine Romer was wearing approximately $81,000 worth of jewelry.",
      "They had checked into a Holiday Inn in Brunswick, Georgia, where hotel employees grew concerned that their bed had not been slept in and reported them missing.",
      "But decades later, answers appear to be emerging from a Georgia pond.",
      "One human bone was discovered in the submerged Lincoln Continental on Nov. 22,\u00a0according to a Saturday statement from the Glynn County Police Department.",
      "\u201cThe vehicle is similar to the description of a vehicle that Charles and Catherine Romer were believed to be driving,\u201d the police department said in the statement posted to Facebook.",
      "The car was found in a pond between the Royal Inn Hotel and Interstate 95 on New Jesup Highway in southeast Georgia, police said, adding that the agency is collaborating with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.",
      "Seaman said a detective informed her family that along with a femur found in the Continental, personal belongings such as jewelry and a license plate bearing the couple\u2019s initials were also discovered in the car.",
      "Lawton Dodd, a spokesperson for Glynn County police, said on Friday the human remains have not been identified as belonging to either of the Romers, and the vehicle has not been determined to belong to the couple. Dodd declined to elaborate.",
      "'A happy time'",
      "Although a positive identification or identifications are not expected for months, Seaman said the developments have led her family to believe the couple died in some kind of accident rather than falling victim to a vicious crime.",
      "Seaman, who spoke from Scotland, said she and her family enjoyed Thanksgiving and reminisced about their missing relatives.",
      "\u201cThe whole family just shared stories about them. It was a happy time because of this resolve we\u2019re feeling,\u201d Seaman said. \u201cIt sort of gave us permission to celebrate their lives and talk about the fun memories without the feeling of dread, sorrow and sadness.\u201d",
      "Seaman said she was only 15 when her grandmother and her step-grandfather \u2014 Charles was Catherine\u2019s second husband \u2014 vanished.",
      "She still remembers the look on her dad\u2019s face after he spoke to a detective in Georgia who told them the couple was missing.",
      "\u201cWe saw his face and he said, \u2018Something is very, very wrong.\u2019\u201d Seaman explained that her father was his mother\u2019s only child and he had not heard from her, which was unusual.",
      "Seaman described her grandmother as the \u201clife of the party\u201d who was very close to Seaman and her eight sisters. Catherine Romer loved thoroughbred racing and enjoyed traveling with her granddaughters, introducing them to new foods and restaurants, Seaman said.",
      "\u201cShe was like the celebrity of our house. She was always visiting us. She was very much part of our upbringing,\u201d she said. \u201cShe made everyone feel like her favorite child \u2014 her favorite granddaughter.\u201d",
      "Seaman called Charles Romer a \u201clovely and generous man.\u201d",
      "She expressed gratitude toward investigators and a diving team from Florida, the Sunshine State Sonar team, that found the submerged Continental.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all in shock, but ... we have this gratitude for the people that hunted this whole mystery down,\u201d Seaman said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t know us and we\u2019re not related to and are perfect strangers would go to extensive measures to find answers and \u2026 help give a family peace of mind and resolve.\u201d"

    "title": "The affordable housing shortage is reshaping parts of rural America",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 14:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "When Suzanne D\u2019Amico moved from Dallas an hour north to Celina, Texas, there was one grocery store, longhorn cattle down the road and no lights on the horizon at night.",
    "story": [
      "When Suzanne D\u2019Amico moved from Dallas an hour north to Celina, Texas, there was one grocery store, longhorn cattle down the road and no lights on the horizon at night. Farmers wearing overalls gathered for morning coffee, teenagers packed the local pizzeria after Friday night football games, and neighbors prayed together at church on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were on another planet,\u201d said D\u2019Amico, who has lived for nearly 30 years in Celina where she raised her children. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just outside the city, we were completely gone from anything we considered at the time remotely civilized.\u201d",
      "But D\u2019Amico\u2019s slice of small town America is quickly vanishing. Like rural communities across the country, Celina is seeing a housing boom that made it America\u2019s fastest growing city in 2023. Now, pastures have been replaced with densely packed homes, golf carts zip around planned communities where tractors once plowed and local businesses are being replaced with big box chains.",
      "While the expansion of the suburbs is nothing new, a surge in home prices over the past several years has supercharged the trend, pushing homebuyers across the country further out from city centers to areas like Celina where land is cheaper and more plentiful and local barriers for developers tend to be lower.",
      "Since the start of the pandemic, the population in rural areas has been growing for the first time in at least a decade, a U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis found. Among the 500 fastest growing cities in the country, the number of those more than 30 miles from a city center increased by 26% between 2019 to 2023, according to Census figures.",
      "At the forefront of that trend is Celina. Its population increased by 27% in 2023 and over the past decade the town has gone from around 7,000 residents to more than 43,000 last year, according to Census data. With more than 200 people moving there each week, the city projects it will have more than 100,000 residents by 2029.",
      "\u201cFor families that are moving now, affordability is a huge factor,\u201d said Celina Mayor Ryan Tubbs, who said the town has been attracting people from higher-priced parts of Dallas as well as more expensive states like California. \u201cThe amount of house that you can get goes a lot farther.\u201d",
      "For those coming to Celina, which is about 40 miles north of Dallas, the development boom has provided a refuge from soaring housing prices, allowing newcomers to have the suburban lifestyle they are seeking at a lower cost than they could find elsewhere. But for some longtime residents, the migration has meant a loss to their sense of community, higher costs and a threat to their livelihoods.",
      "A shortage of undeveloped land in the Dallas area has pushed builders further north into Collin County, which includes Celina and other fast growing communities like Princeton, Prosper and Anna. There, homebuilders are selling 2,000-square-foot homes for $400,000 to $500,000 compared to $700,000 to $1 million for a similar home in suburbs closer into downtown Dallas, said Bryan Swindell, president of PulteGroup\u2019s Dallas Division.",
      "\u201cSouthern Collin County is just getting really, really, really expensive. Places like Frisco, McKinney, they just have no more large pieces of land so builders have started working north,\u201d said Swindell. \u201cWhen a piece of land comes on the market there\u2019s 10 developers and builders bidding on it.\u201d",
      "Most of the new developments being built are master-planned communities with more than 1,000 tightly packed homes, a scale that makes the construction process more economical for builders. Many of the communities have their own self-contained amenities, like pools, parks, biking trails, playgrounds, and in some cases, their own school.",
      "The big box retailers and chain stores are following the migration. The town will get its first Walmart and Costco in the coming months and last year it got its second Starbucks.",
      "While Celina has been racing to keep up with the pace of growth, the nearby town of Princeton, Texas, the third fastest growing city in the country, put a hold on all new residential development in September to give the city time to expand its water and roadway infrastructure and build up the necessary police force.",
      "'It's happening'",
      "For LaCinda Russell, the growth has come at a loss. Her family has lived near Celina for three generations, but after home prices in the region increased more than 50% over the past five years she doesn\u2019t expect to ever be able to afford her own home there. She\u2019s been living with her best friend in the house her friend\u2019s family built more than two decades ago \u2014 a place that now feels like an island of familiarity in a sea of change.",
      "Outside her window, a large crane is putting in a well on land that she expects to become a subdivision once the elderly woman who has owned it for decades passes away. The town recently lost the pizzeria where her classmates used to gather after football games along with a popular snow cone stand and burger joint off the town square.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen businesses come and go. I\u2019ve seen people come and go,\u201d said Russell. \u201cSentimentality dies when you cannot afford to maintain that lifestyle, and that\u2019s a lot of what we\u2019re seeing around here. People that have owned land for hundreds of years around here are having to let it go.\u201d",
      "That growth has also threatened those trying to make a living off the land, which has some of the country\u2019s best soil for farming and cattle grazing. Collin County lost 115,000 acres of farmland between 2012 and 2022 and the number of farms with more than 500 acres has been nearly cut in half over that time, according to USDA data. Nationwide, the country lost 35 million acres of farmland over that period.",
      "\u201cNorth Texas is some of the most fertile soil in the country, that\u2019s why Dallas is where it\u2019s at and we\u2019re building houses and developments on top of it,\u201d said Kelcey Kasper, a sixth-generation rancher whose family has been in Collin County since the 1860s. \u201cThey\u2019re not making any more land so eventually, if we keep building like we are, there won\u2019t be any land for ag production. We\u2019ll have to rely on somebody else for our food. I think that\u2019s a really scary future.\u201d",
      "Kasper currently raises cattle and grows hay about 30 miles east of Celina, but he fears the growth happening there will soon be coming for his community and jeopardizing his ability to keep the family tradition going. Most farmers and ranchers in the area have to lease their land from investors or developers, who have been buying up properties over the past decade.",
      "\u201cI intend to live here for as long as I can, but I may not always be able to run livestock here and farm here, because the property values are going up,\u201d Kasper said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard being able to still make a living out here because the land is going away.\u201d",
      "But that loss is a gain for newcomers like Jasmine Hughes. She is among those who flocked to the area looking for a more affordable life for her and her six children. When she was living in Dallas, her rent was $1,900 a month for a two-bedroom apartment and she struggled to find anything in her price range with more space. Now, she\u2019s renting a three-bedroom house in a sprawling subdivision for $2,500 a month with better schools and more outdoor space.",
      "\u201cI just needed something that was more affordable,\u201d said Hughes, who moved to the area last year. \u201cThat is why we moved out here. It\u2019s more realistic to get into a three or four-bedroom house so that me and my kids can all sleep and live comfortably.\u201d",
      "In just the past year, the main road o\u200b\u200butside her subdivision has added a Starbucks, a McDonald\u2019s, a carwash and dentist office.\u00a0 She sees that growth as a professional opportunity \u2014 she runs a daycare that she is hoping to expand and has started teaching fitness classes.",
      "\u201cI feel excited about it, I just see so much opportunity for me and my family,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI do hear some of the people who\u2019ve lived here not wanting Celina to change that much, which I do understand, but it\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "Local officials are seeing no slowdown in growth, which has presented a range of logistical challenges. The city is proposing $757 million in projects over the next five years, including new parks, water infrastructure and an emergency dispatch center. The school district plans to add one to two new elementary schools each year for the foreseeable future.",
      "Keeping Celina relatively affordable has also been a challenge for local officials with the typical home now selling for around $550,000. As land prices go up in Celina, developers like Plute\u2019s Swindell are looking even further north to be able to build homes in the $300,000 price range.",
      "'A mixed blessing'",
      "Luke Thigpen moved to Celina in 2019 to start a church and has been renting while trying to save up to buy a home for around $400,000. But it has been a challenge as home prices have continued to rise year after year.",
      "He sees the growth as an opportunity, especially when it comes to expanding his congregation, but he worries about the tensions a wave of newcomers could create in a community known for having a strong tradition of Christian values.",
      "\u201cPeople see diversity coming in and they automatically put their guard up. They want to protect what they find are good values in life and that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Thigpen said. \u201cYou have other cultures that are moving in and it\u2019s just simply an understanding that some people see the world differently, some people celebrate life differently and you have to make room for that.\u201d",
      "For D\u2019Amico, after nearly three decades in Celina, she\u2019s seen both pros and cons from the growth. Her husband\u2019s construction business has thrived and the value of the land they\u2019ve purchased over the years has soared.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen full fields of five-foot tall sunflowers, full fields of winter wheat, head-high corn and it\u2019s hard to see it gone now,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband is a builder so it\u2019s kind of a mixed blessing for us, but I do hate to see the fields go away.\u201d",
      "A 2,500-acre ranch down the road from her home was recently sold to a developer who plans to put thousands of housing units on it. Soon, a thoroughfare will be cutting through the open land 500 yards from her back fence.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s going to kill my silence, the quietness around my house,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had 27 years of it, so I can\u2019t really complain, but it has become very precious to me now.\u201d"

      "New charges filed against a Colorado dentist accused of fatally poisoning his wife\u2019s protein shakes focus on his alleged efforts to kill a detective involved in the case, authorities said.",
      "A spokesman for the Aurora Police Department confirmed the accuracy of a report from NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver about the solicitation to commit first-degree murder charge filed last week against James Craig, 46.",
      "Craig was previously arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the March 18, 2023, death of his wife of 23 years, Angela Craig, 43. He has pleaded not guilty to that charge.",
      "Citing a professional conflict, Craig\u2019s lawyer withdrew from the case just before prosecutors filed the solicitation charge last week. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Craig has a new attorney to speak on his behalf about the new charges, which also include solicitation to commit perjury.",
      "According to records obtained by KUSA, Craig was in jail twice with the man he allegedly sought to have murder the detective, once in May and June 2023 and again last month. The inmate has not been accused of any crimes in connection with the Craig case, the station reported.",
      "Citing multiple sources familiar with the investigation, the station reported that the detective who was the target of the alleged plot worked on the investigation into Angela Craig\u2019s death.",
      "The police spokesman declined to provide additional details to NBC News about the allegations.",
      "Authorities previously accused James Craig of dosing his wife\u2019s drink with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, a medication found in eye drops. She first became sick in early March 2023 and was admitted to a hospital on March 15 with a severe headache and dizziness. Angela Craig later died after experiencing a severe seizure, authorities said in James Craig\u2019s arrest warrant.",
      "Investigators initially believed her death was a result of poisoning by arsenic and cyanide, according to the arrest warrant. But the county coroner later attributed it to a combination of cyanide and tetrahydrozoline.",
      "Authorities have pointed to Craig's internet search history, which showed he sought information on whether arsenic was detectable in an autopsy. They also pointed to his online purchases: Weeks before his wife's death, Craig ordered potassium cyanide from Amazon and had it delivered to his dental practice, the warrant shows.",
      "When James Craig\u2019s business partner learned of the purchase, he flagged it as suspicious to a nurse at the facility where Angela Craig was hospitalized. There was no medical reason to buy cyanide for a dental practice, he told the nurse, according to the warrant.",
      "The nurse, a mandatory reporter, then contacted authorities.",
      "When the business partner confronted James Craig about it, he initially denied buying the cyanide but later said his wife asked him to order it, according to the warrant.",
      "At a court hearing last year, Craig\u2019s defense lawyer said there was no direct evidence showing his client poisoned his wife\u2019s drink.",
      "That lawyer withdrew last week on the day jury selection was supposed to begin in Craig\u2019s trial. The lawyer partly attributed his withdrawal to a belief that his client \u201cpersists in a course of action involving the lawyer\u2019s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent,\u201d KUSA reported.",
      "Jury selection has been indefinitely postponed, the station reported."

      "An Arizona produce company is recalling all sizes of its whole, fresh American cucumbers in 26 states and parts of Canada because they could be contaminated with salmonella, it said.",
      "SunFed said in an announcement posted online Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration that cucumbers it sold from Oct. 12 to Nov. 26 were recalled because of the potential contamination, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.",

      "They were also sold in parts of Canada, including the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Calgary, Ontario and Saskatchewan.",

      "Beck and King threw matching touchdown passes followed by conventional extra points. Then it was King scoring on a 1-yard run, only to have Beck respond with a 25-yard scoring pass to Cash Jones. Both teams failed to convert their 2-point tries, so it came down to nothing but 2-point tries.",

      "For a moment, Jared Verse thought he had him.",
      "After he shed his blocker in the third quarter last Sunday at SoFi Stadium, Verse, the Los Angeles Rams linebacker, lunged at running back Saquon Barkley. But instead of tackling his opponent, he only grabbed air.",
      "By the time Verse got up off the field, Barkley, the Philadelphia Eagles superstar, was already past defenders and on his way to a 72-yard touchdown run. It was just one brilliant moment in a game of brilliant moments for Barkley, who finished with 255 yards rushing and two scores to go along with four catches for 47 yards in a 37-20 win.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a running back like that,\u201d Verse said after the game.",
      "What players marveled at that night \u2014 speed, strength, lateral movement, vision \u2014 are what Philadelphia fans have grown accustomed to all year. Barkley (1,392 yards in 11 games so far) is on pace to break the NFL\u2019s all-time mark for rushing yards in a season, set by Eric Dickerson in 1984 (2,105). He looks every bit the missing piece for a 9-2 Eagles team that has come up short of its Super Bowl aspirations in recent years.",
      "It makes you think: Why would a team allow him to leave?",
      "That question is what New York Giants fans has been asking themselves since Barkley for their division rival in March. And they aren\u2019t the only ones questioning their team\u2019s executives.",
      "While Barkley is a leading candidate for NFL MVP, other veteran ball carriers, like Derrick Henry (whose Baltimore Ravens play the Eagles on Sunday at 4:25 p.m.), Houston\u2019s Joe Mixon and Green Bay\u2019s Josh Jacobs, are all enjoying career seasons with new franchises.",
      "Their success has general managers around the league wondering whether the long-held belief that older running backs shouldn't be paid massive contracts is still correct. Are Barkley, Henry, Mixon and Jacobs the start of something new, or are they outliers?",

      "It\u2019s not a shock that teams historically prefer to move on after a rookie deal. The longer players are in the league, the more wear and tear their bodies suffer, with a higher likelihood of production drop-off. That is especially true at running back, one of the most injury-prone positions in the league.",
      "ESPN\u2019s Tristan Cockcroft confirmed the notion ahead of last season from a fantasy football perspective.",
      "\u201cAmong those who debuted since 2000, running backs experienced a 25.2% decline in PPR points per game, and 37.0% in total PPR points scored, from their age-28 to age-29 seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly 11 running backs have reached their age-28 and 29 seasons since 2010 and the group saw a 16.8% decline in PPR points per game going from ages 26 to 27, 8.4% decline going from 27 to 28 and a 15.3% decline going from 28 to 29.\u201d",
      "The Giants, a rebuilding team as it was, didn\u2019t want to commit a large part of their salary cap to an aging running back who just a few years ago tore an ACL. They could have signed Barkley to a multiyear deal or franchise-tagged him for $12.1 million. But with many other needs, they chose not to pay their star and allowed him to become a free agent.",
      "In a now-famous episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks,\u201d New York general manager Joe Schoen told owner John Mara they would let him hit the open market.",
      "\u201cIn a perfect world I would still like to have him back,\u201d Mara said of Barkley. \u201cUntil we can prove that we can have a decent offense without him ...\u201d",
      "Quarterback \u201cDaniel [Jones] is making a lot of money,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cWe got to figure out if he\u2019s the guy, so we got to protect him. We need to put resources there.\u201d",
      "Mara later told Schoen that he\u2019s \u201cgoing to have a tough time sleeping if Saquon goes to Philadelphia.\u201d",
      "Barkley would, in fact, go on to sign with the Eagles on a three-year, $37.75 million deal, and he has been nearly unstoppable. The Giants replaced him with free agent Devin Singletary and rookie Tyron Tracy, but at 2-10 they are among the NFL\u2019s worst teams. New York also just released Jones.",
      "Baltimore\u2019s Henry, meanwhile, is on a similar trajectory to Barkley\u2019s. After eight seasons in Tennessee, Henry, 30, signed a two-year, $16 million deal to join Lamar Jackson and Co.",
      "So far, so good.",
      "Henry leads the NFL in touchdowns (13), ranks No. 2 in yards (1,325) and is a crucial member of the league\u2019s most prolific offense.",
      "Behind Barkley and Henry on the rushing leaders list is Jacobs, who signed a four-year, $48 million deal with the Packers after five years with the Las Vegas Raiders. In last week's game, he had 106 yards rushing and three touchdowns in a huge win against the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "And you can\u2019t forget about Mixon, the former Cincinnati Bengals running back who was traded to the Texans in March in exchange for a 2024 seventh-round draft pick. He has put up monster numbers with his new team, ranking in the top 10 in both yards (786) and touchdowns (10) despite having missed multiple games with a high ankle sprain earlier in the year. He has failed to find the end zone in only two games.",
      "\u201cI feel great to be appreciated here and to play a big part in what we do,\u201d Mixon told NBC Sports in September. \u201cI\u2019m [going to] do whatever is asked of me as a player ... be the best teammate and leader that I know how to be. I\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m on this side now.\u201d",
      "The immediate success of those running backs, at the very least, makes the decision for teams to pay up on new contracts harder. Ask Giants fans \u2014 they would back up the Brinks truck for Barkley in a heartbeat.",
      "Barkley says he\u2019s \u201cthankful for the fresh start.\u201d",
      "\u201cMe and my family, my fianc\u00e9e, had a conversation of \u2018I think this is a spot where I can kind of rewrite my story. I feel like I can show everyone what type of player that I can be and was meant to be,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s working out right now.\u201d"

A 10-yard penalty against Teven\u00a0Jenkins\u00a0for illegal use of hands pushed Chicago back to the 35, making for a longer attempt that was still within kicker Cairo Santos' range.",
      "Chaos ensued after Bears quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked by Detroit's Za'Darius\u00a0Smith\u00a0for a 6-yard loss with about 32 seconds left \u2014 as the clock kept ticking.",
      "Eberflus opted against calling his third and final timeout at that moment. After the game, Eberflus said he wanted Willians to run one more play to recapture that lost yardage before calling his final timeout and sending Santos on for the kick.",
      "But that urgency was not communicated to Williams, who slowly regrouped his teammates and lined them up.  The precious seconds ticked away and a frozen Eberflus inexplicably failed to call timeout.",
      "Williams finally took the snap with 5 seconds left and fluttered a deep pass that fell harmlessly incomplete as time expired. Even if that aimless heave had found the hands of Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze, he would've been tackled inbounds with no time left.",

      "Moments before Brown's catch, Bears\u00a0cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was busy taunting Commanders fans off to the side as the play was unfolding. He hurriedly got back to the action and tipped Daniels' pass into Brown's hands."

      "Has a change of manager given Liverpool the edge in the title race?",
      "Replacing Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool was the equivalent of replacing Bill Belichick or Andy Reid, but Arne Slot has already somehow made Klopp, who won seven major trophies in his eight years and totally rebuilt the club back to a global power, look like an underachiever. Slot has won 15 of his first 17 games in all competitions. Liverpool are top of the Premier League and Champions League tables.",
      "How have they done it?",
      "There have been subtle tweaks to Klopp\u2019s high-pressing \"heavy metal football\" with Slot\u2019s rhythmic possession-based style intertwined.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones are the new, unexpected, conductors in midfield. They drift around, cushion passes and deftly produce a killer pass. Klopp\u2019s Liverpool is still there. But this Liverpool pick their moments when to put the throttle to the floor. Slot\u2019s extra wrinkle has happened so quickly that most teams still don\u2019t know how to react to it.",
      "Liverpool is now a two-headed beast. They can lull you into a false sense of security by passing the ball around serenely, boring you into submission. But they can still turn up the pace when they want to. Preparing to play against them has become a dizzying multi-dimensional challenge and nobody can stop them.",

That is a big part of it but a team that has been imperious for so long shouldn\u2019t capitulate like this because one player is out. A perfect storm of bad luck, big mistakes and father time is threatening to capsize what is arguably the greatest team in English soccer history.",

I\u2019m probably more out than in,\u201d Salah said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to retire soon so I\u2019m just playing, focusing on the season and I\u2019m trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well. I\u2019m disappointed but we will see.\u201d",

      "But Salah, 32, is out of contract this summer, along with Liverpool\u2019s captain Virgil van Dijk, 33, who is one of the best defenders of all-time, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, 26, one of the greatest products of Liverpool\u2019s youth system who has won everything in the game along with Salah and Van Dijk over the past seven years. Salah is to Liverpool what Michael Jordan was to the Chicago Bulls. Van Dijk is Rodman. Alexander-Arnold is Pippen.",
      "That these three stars are out of contract this summer, while Liverpool are having one of their best-ever starts to a season, is puzzling for most Liverpool fans.",
      "Salah\u2019s comments over the last week cranks up the pressure on Liverpool\u2019s owners, the Fenway Sports Group (FSG) who also own the Boston Red Sox, to give these three superstars huge new contracts. That isn\u2019t necessarily going to happen due to Liverpool\u2019s wage structure, league-imposed spending limits, the age of Salah and Van Dijk, and the direction Michael Edwards, who has just returned to Liverpool as their new Chief Executive of Football, wants to go in.",
      "Salah, and either Van Dijk or Alexander-Arnold, could still stay at Liverpool after adding a few more winners\u2019 medals around their neck this season. But surely not all three. This situation has a very \u201cLast Dance\u201d feel about it."

      "LONDON \u2014 The countryside came to the capital as thousands of farmers packed into London streets around Britain\u2019s Parliament to protest changes to tax rules.",
      "Some drove tractors, others brought hay bales, many carried signs saying \u201cno farms, no food.\u201d All were protesting against the new Labour government\u2019s decision to tax inherited agricultural property.",
      "\u201cBritish farmers make less than 1% profit,\u201d Tom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers Union (NFU), said in a statement to NBC News shortly after last week\u2019s protests. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the money in the bank to pay this proposed family farm tax.\u201d",
      "It was the first major demonstration in London since Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government took power in July. Rachel Reeves, his finance minister, announced the changes, which are set to come into effect in April 2026, in her annual budget last month.",
      "Similar to estate tax in the U.S., inheritance tax in the U.K. is charged at 40% on the property, possessions and money of someone who has died, above a threshold of 325,000 pounds, or around $410,000. A spousal exemption means married couples and civil partners can pool their allowances to pass on up to $1.2 million to their heirs tax-free.",
      "But under the current rules, land holdings used for crops or rearing animals, plus farm buildings, cottages and houses, have been handed down through the generations without the need to pay the tax, meaning together the total value of a tax-free inheritance could be around $3.77 million.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than $1.3 million will face a 20% tax when they are passed on to the next generation, half the usual rate.",
      "Defending the changes, which supporters say will recoup money from wealthy people who have bought up agricultural land as an investment and driven up the cost of farmland, Starmer said at the Group of 20 summit in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro last week that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of farms would be \u201cunaffected\u201d by the taxation changes.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.K.\u2019s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) also said in a statement that \u201caround 500 claims of Agricultural and Business Property Relief each year will be impacted,\u201d figures that were \u201cbased off actual claims data.\u201d",
      "A separate report published Monday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economics research institute, also said that \u201csignificantly less than 500 estates per year\u201d will be affected by the changes.",
      "But the NFU, along with the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), a membership organization representing land, property and businesses owners, have estimated that tens of thousands more will be affected.",
      "\u201cMinisters claim the inheritance tax cap hits only the rich, but it could put 70,000 farms \u2014 big and small \u2014 at risk. All will be questioning their future, and whether they\u2019ll have one to pass on,\u201d CLA President Victoria Vyvyan said in a statement.",
      "Noting the disparity between the government\u2019s figure and its own, on its website the CLA said it was \u201clooking at the impact on farms over a generation, whereas the government\u2019s figure is only looking at a single year. We are not \u2014 claiming that 70,000 farms will shut down or have to pay the tax a year.\u201d The website defines a generation as 40 years.",
      "The NFU pointed NBC News to a Nov. 21 report it produced with economists who formerly worked for Britain\u2019s Treasury and Office for Budget Responsibility that says around 75% of commercial family farms would be required to pay the tax.",
      "The protest in London was supported by JCB, which manufactures a wide range of farming equipment and machinery for construction. After giving its employees the day off to join the demonstrations, the company said in a statement that it was \u201ccrucial that food from Britain feeds our nation as not all the food we need can come from abroad.\u201d",
      "Despite the gray skies and wet weather, those who did join witnessed scenes similar to those seen in other European cities, where roads have been snarled by farmers protesting a variety of issues including grain prices and European Union farming policies.",
      "But while some of the protests on the continent turned violent, in London the mood was much more jovial as\u00a0children on toy tractors pedaled around Parliament Square after a rally addressed by speakers including former \u201cTop Gear\u201d TV host and celebrity farmer Jeremy Clarkson.",
      "While some promised to escalate the protests unless the hike is removed, Starmer\u2019s government, which won a large majority in July\u2019s general election, looks set to stand firm.",
      "\u201cOur commitment to our farmers is steadfast \u2014 we have committed \u00a35 billion to the farming budget over two years, including more money than ever for sustainable food production,\u201d the Defra spokesperson said.",
      "Environment Minister Steve Reed also told reporters last week that the government was \u201ctaking decisions because they\u2019re in the interest of every part of the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be sorry for trying to make this country\u2019s economy work and our public services work again,\u201d he said."

      "Black Friday takes place every year the day after Thanksgiving and falls on Nov. 29 this year. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday are no longer just 24-hour events \u2014 brands have morphed their holiday sales into weeks of doorbuster deals.",
      "Some Black Friday deals end at 11:59 p.m. on Nov. 29, while others run through the weekend and even through Cyber Monday. Most retailers host their sales through the Cyber Five, meaning the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. That said, the strongest deals usually end once Cyber Monday is over on Dec. 2.",
      "Once Black Friday is over, prices for already on-sale products usually don\u2019t drop any lower on Cyber Monday. Retailers might add new deals to their offerings, but the selection is largely a repeat of Black Friday. Because of this, I wouldn\u2019t recommend holding out for Cyber Monday sales. If the Black Friday price fits within your budget, it\u2019s best to purchase it as soon as you find it \u2014 waiting could mean it sells out.",
      "How I found the best Black Friday deals",
      "All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select\u2019s previous coverage and reporting. I also included products the NBC Select staff tested, including Wellness Award, Travel Award, Pet Award, Bed & Bath Award and Giftable Tech Award winners. All the deals I recommend are at least 20% off and highly rated with at least a 4.0-star average rating from hundreds of reviews. When possible, I ran deals through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to ensure products are at their lowest price in at least three months.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m a reporter at NBC Select who\u2019s covered Black Friday and Cyber Monday since 2020. I\u2019ve reported on the history of these holidays and spoken to experts about what you should buy and skip during major shopping events, like today\u2019s. For this story, since not all Black Friday deals are worth it, I sifted through hundreds of on-sale products to find the best ones actually worth buying across key categories, like tech, travel, home, and kitchen.",

    "summary": "The Atlantic hurricane season comes to its official end Saturday. Storm forecasters are taking stock of its surprising pattern of activity.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends Saturday.Its pattern of activity surprised forecasters: The season got busy early and produced strong, late storms, but what is usually considered the peak period was quiet.Climate change most likely made the observed storms more severe.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends Saturday.",
      "Its pattern of activity surprised forecasters: The season got busy early and produced strong, late storms, but what is usually considered the peak period was quiet.",
      "Climate change most likely made the observed storms more severe.",
      "A strange, damaging hurricane season comes to its official end Saturday, and forecasters are taking stock of its many surprises.",
      "\u201cEvery year there\u2019s one or two things that make me scratch my head, and this year I was doing more head-scratching than normal,\u201d said Philip Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University who specializes in Atlantic hurricane forecasts.",
      "Most forecasters predicted a hyperactive hurricane season as early as April, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issuing its highest-ever forecast.",
      "In the end, 18 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes formed \u2014 at the lower end of the range most forecasters expected, though still an above-normal and \u201cextremely active\u201d season.",
      "What surprised researchers was the bizarre way the season played out. It got off to a roaring start when Hurricane Beryl became the first Category 5 storm seen in the Atlantic Ocean in June. But from mid-August through early September, all went quiet. That\u2019s usually when the season reaches its peak \u2014\u00a0around Sept. 10. But not a single named storm developed during those weeks, the first time since 1968 that has happened.",
      "Just when researchers thought their forecasts were turning into busts, storm activity roared back to life and hurricanes Helen and Milton struck, causing billions in damage.",
      "\u201cIt took your normal seasonal cycle and turned it on its head,\u201d Klotzbach said. \u201cWhat stood out to me \u2014 it was like a switch flipped and it went completely off and completely on. It went from nothing to Helene and a bunch of storms in the east Atlantic and Milton.\u201d",
      "Researchers are studying what led to the strange pattern to boost their understanding of the factors that drive hurricanes and improve future forecasts.",
      "The reasons researchers predicted a busy, dangerous hurricane season this spring were record high ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and a likelihood that La Ni\u00f1a, a natural pattern of variability, would take hold. Ocean heat provides fuel for hurricanes, and it can enable them to intensify more quickly. La Ni\u00f1a is associated with hurricanes because it often decreases stability in the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cEarly on, we thought it would be the busiest season on record,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Although ocean temperatures remained at or near record highs in the North Atlantic, La Ni\u00f1a did not develop strongly, said Matthew Rosencrans, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service.",
      "Other factors most likely combined to cause the surprising lull in activity, as well.",
      "About 60% of hurricanes form as a result of Africa\u2019s tropical monsoon season, which draws moisture into an area called the Sahel. But this year, the monsoon developed in a different location.",
      "\"The monsoon ended up so far north and was so intense it ended up in places that hadn\u2019t had rain in 45 years,\u201d Rosencrans said. The change dampened tropical storm development.",
      "A separate climate pattern called the Madden Julian oscillation, which is a grouping of storms that travels near the equator, most likely also contributed, slowing storm development in early September and then allowing hurricanes to take off later in the month, Rosencrans said.",
      "Researchers will spend the winter investigating which factors had the most influence via climate and weather models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to learn, to look at the system and have the Earth teach us something new,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite the midseason break from tropical storms, 2024 set several records. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., tying several years for the second most in history, according to a review Klotzbach published.",
      "Helene was the strongest hurricane to ever strike Florida\u2019s Big Bend. And seven hurricanes formed in the Atlantic after Sept. 25, the most in recorded history.",
      "Hurricane Milton set a record for tornado warnings in Florida and spawned dozens of tornadoes.",
      "Research suggests climate change made Helene and Milton worse. Both hurricanes went through a rapid intensification process, in which a hurricane\u2019s sustained wind speeds increase by at least 35 mph over 24 hours. The trend has become more common as global temperatures rise.",
      "What\u2019s more, scientists who study the influence of climate change on weather found that rainfall in one-day events like Milton is now about 20% to 30% more intense because of climate change. The researchers, with the World Weather Attribution project, also determined that Milton\u2019s wind speeds were most likely 10% stronger because of climate change\u2019s influence. The group produced similar results for Hurricane Helene.",
      "A report published by Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that tracks climate trends, found that all 11 Atlantic hurricanes this year were intensified by an additional 9 to 28 mph because of human-caused global warming, primarily because of record warmth in the ocean.",
      "Rosencrans said research generally does not suggest that climate change will shift the number of named storms (those with winds of 39 mph or greater). However, a greater proportion of named storms will be expected to become hurricanes, and a larger share of those hurricanes will reach Category 4 or 5. That was true this year."

      "\"Birdie let us know on Thursday that she wasn\u2019t feeling herself (a renowned foodie, Birdie never missed a meal). We were surprised to learn that, not only was she very ill, she was at the end of her life,\" Garner continued.",
      "\"The vet told us that dogs often hang on until their person comes home from college and we believe Birdie did just that, so that we could pet her soft ears together and thank her for being the world\u2019s best dog,\" she went on, seemingly referring to oldest daughter Violet Affleck, 18, who began her first year at Yale University in August.",
      "\"Birdie,\" noted Garner, \"loved to be read to, always found her way into a Pretend Cooking Show, and knew just how to give people what they needed (as evidenced by her happy days as a dog therapy team with Mo).",

      "When Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's romance first began, some fans felt like it was a romantic-comedy plot come to life.",
      "Well, now, it might be just that.",
      "Lifetime's \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" which premiered on the network Nov. 23, is seemingly inspired by the popular couple.",
      "The film focuses on mega pop-star Bowyn Sykes (Jessica Lord), who has blond hair, bright red lips and often sports a cat-eye. Bowyn is at the height of her career, focused on making music her fans love, baking for fun and not looking for a new boyfriend after being tired of only dating \u201cserious actors and indie rockers.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Drew \"Gonzo\" Gonville (Laith Wallschleger) is one of the best wide receivers in the league who, from the outside, seems like a playboy, but he really loves hanging out with his family and niece.",
      "The end credits of the movie state, \"The characters and events depicted in this motion picture are fictional. Any similarities to actual persons or animals living or dead are purely coincidental.\"",
      "The movie's writer Eirene Tran Donohue told USA Today that after seeing Swift cheering on Kelce during a football game, she thought, \"This could be a rom-com.\"",
      "\"I was like, \u2018Christmas and Taylor Swift?' These are the two great loves of my life,\" she said.",
      "Speaking to the Associated Press, Tran Donohue said, \"It\u2019s clearly inspired by Taylor and Travis, but I don\u2019t know them, and I don\u2019t know what is going on behind the scenes.\"",
      "But she said she wrote the script for Swift fans.",
      "\u201cThere are so many Easter eggs,\u201d she told AP. \u201cI put in as many as I could.\u201d",
      "Here's a roundup of all the apparent references to Swift, Kelce and their headline-making relationship.",
      "Like Swift's Swifties, Bowyn's fans also have a nickname \u2014 \"Arrows\" or \"Arrow heads.\" (\"Bows, arrows, Bowyn's arrows, get it?\" one character explains at the start of the film.)",
      "Arrowhead is also notably the name of the Kansas City Chiefs' stadium, and the place where Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship.",
      "The male lead of \"Christmas in the Spotlight\" plays for the fictional Bay Spring Bombers. His jersey number doesn't emulate Kelce's (No. 87) but rather, Swift's lucky number, 13.",
      "In \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" Bowyn and Drew meet backstage at one of her concerts. Drew then attempts to get Bowyn\u2019s attention after their brief meet up backstage by inviting her to a game over social media.",
      "While, Swift and Kelce famously did not meet at the \"Eras Tour,\" their relationship was set in motion after the tight end shared that he tried and failed to pass along his phone number while at her show.",
      "During one of their first meetings, Bowyn tells Drew, \u201cGrowing up, I was never really the cheerleader type, more of a bleacher girl. Kind of a nerd to be honest,\" paralleling Swift's line \"She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers,\" from her song \"You Belong with Me.\"",
      "On their first date, which just so happens to be in Bowyn's private jet, the two have a myriad of song lyric interactions relating to Swift's \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\" Bowyn says, \"I'm a tough kid.\" Then, Drew notes, \"You look like you\u2019re having the time of your life.\"",
      "Newscasters in the film are also given seemingly Swift inspired names: Chad Marcus (\"Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\") and Aimee Hannah (\"Thank You Aimee\").",
      "Later in the film, the characters' dialogue references songs including, but not limited to: \"The Alchemy,\" \"You're Losing Me,\" \"Wonderland,\" \"All Too Well,\" \"Mean\" and more.",
      "Bowyn and Drew's blissful romance faces its first challenge when he wants to go public, but Bowyn isn't ready yet, maintaining that she values her privacy too much.",
      "The couple breaks up, but the world is still unaware they were ever together. While Bowyn privately mourns the relationship, the media begins speculating when she will release her next \"catchy break up\" song.",
      "Angry at the media and missing Drew, Bowyn decides to show up at his game and surprise him, sitting in his family box. (Swift and Kelce famously went public after she attended the Chiefs-Bears matchup at Arrowhead Stadium Sept. 24, 2023. She's since become a fixture in the box at Chiefs home games.)",
      "In the film, Drew, who initially wasn't having a great game, immediately turns it around after seeing Bowyn. After he scores a touchdown, Drew strikes Kelce's signature archer pose, which Swift has also made on stage during her aptly-titled song, \"The Archer.\"",

      "Now public with their relationship, Bowyn and Drew start supporting each other at their respective games and concerts. The media starts speculating if it\u2019s a PR relationship and the public begins to get invested.",
      "When the duo attends a party for a brand celebrating their \u201cbest things issue,\u201d Drew leaves the event early after a misunderstanding. Meanwhile, Bowyn is intercepted by her actor ex-boyfriend.",
      "Her ex begins questioning why she's with a football player and insulting Drew, but she quickly shuts him down.",
      "\"He is a better man than you in every way and I\u2019ve never been happier,\" she says (either accidentally or purposely referencing two Swift songs, \"Better Man\" and \"Happiness\").",
      "Things start to look up after Bowyn and Drew make up, and the wide receiver is offered a contract with a football team in Los Angeles, potentially putting them in the same city.",
      "Then, Bowyn's ex leaks an edited recording of a conversation the two of them had in which she sarcastically says she is only with Drew for publicity reasons. He conveniently doesn't release the parts of the conversation where she defended Drew.",
      "While initially heartbroken, Drew finally believes Bowyn after his brother (also a football player) and sister-in-law show him the full video, proving she tried to defend him.",
      "This moment could be a reference to the phone call audio Kim Kardashian leaked in 2016 between Swift and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, over the rapper using her name in his song \"Famous.\" The footage caused the internet to turn on Swift, beginning the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty trending hashtag. In 2020, the full, unedited clip was released online.",
      "After the truth is revealed, Drew resigns himself to thinking Bowyn is out of his league.",
      "Before Drew's football game and a Christmas gala he was supposed to host (notably featuring Bowyn as a guest performer), his niece gives him a friendship bracelet for good luck, spelling out an indecipherable mix of letters.",
      "Drew's brother is confused by what it means, but the niece clarifies: \"It's an abbreviation of a Bowyn lyric. Don't you know anything?\"",
      "Friendship bracelets have become a staple accessory \u2014 often with acronyms for notable songs and lyrics \u2014 for the \"Eras Tour\" after Swift's song \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" referenced making them.",
      "In the grand finale of the film, Bowyn sings a Christmas love song at the gala and reveals she wrote it about Drew.",
      "(While Swift never confirms the inspiration for her songs, fans speculate that her songs \"The Alchemy\" and \"So High School\" are about Kelce.)",
      "The only snag for Bowyn? She's been told Drew isn't actually at the event and backed out of hosting.",
      "Nevertheless, she gives a speech declaring her love in the hopes he is watching a livestream of her performance. (During each \"Eras Tour\" show, fans can often find a livestream on social media of the show filmed by a concert attendee.)",
      "But surprisingly, Drew is there and catches her declaration of love.",
      "\"I will always be your biggest cheerleader,\" he says, tying back to Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" once more, before asking her, \"Are we doing this?\"",
      "Bowyn responds, \"Let's freaking go\" \u2014 a PG version of a phrase Swift was caught on camera appearing to say after the Chiefs scored a touchdown in September 2023."

      "A recent four-part documentary, which aired on Lifetime in February 2024, followed the former talk show host and her family as they tried to get a handle on her life and wellbeing in the wake of her stepping away from the beloved \"The Wendy Williams Show.\" Williams was an executive producer on the documentary.",
      "Williams' health becomes a main focus of the documentary, in particular her alcohol use and her cognitive issues. The 60-year-old has since been diagnosed with frontotemporaral dementia, her care team announced in a press release ahead of the documentary's premiere.",

      "Here\u2019s everything to know about Williams\u2019 health:",
      "Williams is 'cognitively impaired and permanently incapacitated,' according to her guardian",
      "After her care team revealed in February 2024 that Williams had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, her guardian, Sabrina Morrisey, said in a November 2024 legal filing that Williams is \"cognitively impaired and permanently incapacitated,\" adding that she's been \"afflicted by early-onset dementia.\"",

      "Primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, impacts speech, reading, writing and the ability to understand what others are saying to you. It\u2019s a subtype of frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, which affects communication, including speech, writing and the ability to understand language.",
      "FTD is caused by shrinking in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control personality, behavior and language. Depending on which parts of the brain are affected, someone might experience personality changes, such as behaving erratically, inappropriately, or becoming distant, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "FTD is sometimes misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it typically occurs at a younger age, between 40 and 65, than other types of dementia.",
      "\u201cMost people, when they think of the word dementia, they think problems with memory and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but FTD doesn\u2019t really show up as problems with memory. ... It affects how people behave, how they interact with others and how they speak,\u201d Dr. Sami Barmada, director of Michigan Brain Bank and associate professor of neurology at University of Michigan Medicine, previously told TODAY.com about Bruce Willis, who was diagnosed with the same conditions.",

This overproduction of thyroid hormones, or hyperthyroidism, can lead to an increased heart rate, sweating, weight loss, anxiety, hair loss, difficulty sleeping and bulging eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Williams noted that her fans had pointed out changes in her eyes when she revealed her diagnosis. \u201cGraves\u2019 disease squeezes the muscles behind the eyeballs,\u201d she explained, adding that it\u2019s caused her eyeballs to twitch.",

      "In the documentary, Williams' lymphedema in her feet takes center stage at certain points. In one scene, she cries out and says she can't stand anymore. In another, she refuses to do exercises with a personal trainer to improve her stability out of fear of falling down.",
      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams' case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn't drain properly. Most often, it develops over a person's lifetime. It's not curable, and can be painful and lead to dangerous complications.",

      "The first \"Moana\" ended with a post-credits scene featuring Tamatoa, the famously shiny crab. When \u201cMoana 2,\u201d the sequel to the 2016 Disney movie, is finished, is it worth sticking around to catch a similar post-credits scene?",
      "Long story short: Yes. Like many Disney and Marvel movies, including the recent \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d has a telling scene during the credits that hints at the future of the franchise. The scene also nods to another Disney movie series returning next November.",

      "Is there an end credits scene in \u2018Moana 2\u2019?",
      "Yes, but it comes during the mid-credits, rather than at the every end of the credits.",
      "What happens in the mid-credits scene in \u2018Moana 2\u2019?",
      "To understand the scene, you have to know what happens in \"Moana 2.\"",
      "In the movie, Moana (Auli\u02bbi Cravalho) and the demi-god Maui (Dwyane Johnson) set sail on yet another quest. This time, they're in search of Motufetu, a hidden land named at the bottom of the sea that her ancestors tried, and failed, to find.",
      "Motufetu is cursed by Nalo (voiced by Tofiga Fepulea\u2019i), a lightning god famous for hating humanity. The curse will be broken if a human reaches the land \u2014 and Moana manages to, becoming a demi-God in the process.",
      "Nalo returns in the mid-credits scene. Previously seen only as a thunderous cloud, this time he's in human form with purple eyes and a lightening aura. He sits in his throne room, frustrated over Moana and Maui breaking his curse. He summons his servant Matangi (Awhimai Fraser), then confronts her about not stopping Moana. Unbeknownst to Nalo, Matangi had helped Moana find Motufetu.",
      "Matangi tells Nalo that she already paid her debt by laying dormant as a guard to the Motufetu portal for thousands of years. In response, Nalo magically puts Matangi in a lightning handcuffs and tells her, \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "As he begins scheming up ideas for vengeance, a familiar voice says, \u201cI can help you with that.\u201d",
      "Out of the shadows, and accompanied by an evil laugh, comes Tamatoa, the giant crab monster from the first movie voiced by Jemaine Clement. But after his brush with Moana, Tamatoa isn't looking as \u201cshiny\u201d as he used to.",
      "Tamatoa sketches out a plan for how he and Nalo can work together to bring down Moana and Maui.",
      "Then, he cracks a few jokes about singing a new song. \u201cI got a new one you\u2019re going to like. It\u2019s called 'Funky Crab Legs,'\u201d he pleads to Nalo, who looks on in disgust.",
      "The credits also have a subtle nod to \u201cZootopia 2.\" The character Gary appears in the form of a decorative image in the background of the scene.",
      "Will there be a \u2018Moana 3\u2019?",
      "Moana's two villains potentially team up in the credits, indicating the story could continue. As of right now, however, Disney has not announced a third movie. TODAY.com has reached out to Disney for comment about a potential \"Moana 3.\""

      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering on the network Nov. 30. The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "As it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",
      "Before he left Arrowhead after delivering his lines, Reid told Jenna that he never would have imagined his stadium as the setting for not one, but now two love stories.",
      "He adds, \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in today\u2019s world, this is a healthy thing.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:43:31 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Wicked's\" director and costume designer say why Dorothy's ruby red slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" are silver in \"Wicked.\"",
    "story": [
      "The ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d became nearly as iconic as the film itself. So why were the slippers silver in \u201cWicked\u201d?",
      "Some sharp-eyed fans noticed the change in the film adaptation of the Broadway show starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 novel \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d",
      "And as it turns out, the choice to include the silver slippers was actually staying true to the original source text: In L. Frank Baum\u2019s book \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d the magic slippers were, in fact, silver.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ruby,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d costume designer Paul Tazewell said in an interview with People. \u201cIn the book, they were these odd little silver boots.\u201d",
      "Tazewell explained he took what happened in Maguire\u2019s novel as a starting point for his creation that ended up in the film.",
      "In \u201cWicked\u201d the book, Nessarose is described as wearing iridescent shoes that seem to \u201cpulse with hundreds of reflections and refractions.\u201d Glinda later enchants the shoes to help Nessarose walk (though in the Broadway play, Elphaba is the one to cast the spell).",
      "Marissa Bode, who plays Nessarose in \u201cWicked,\u201d ultimately wears silver heels with swirls and sparkles in the film, paying homage to the original while also wearing something unique to the film, Tazewell said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the idea of Cinderella and the glass slipper, and then it\u2019s like how we make shoes a myth and how we\u2019ve indulged them into our fantasy fairytale storytelling,\u201d he said.",
      "In the 1939 film, the move from silver to sparkly red was a stylistic change made to emphasize the contrast between the yellow brick road and Dorothy\u2019s gorgeous heels.",
      "\u201cFor the Technicolor movie, costumers created ruby red shoes to show up more vividly against the yellow-brick road,\u201d reads the Smithsonian description of a pair of the ruby slippers used in the film and now housed in the museum in Washington, D.C. Garland wore several pairs when making \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d; another of them is currently up for auction.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu also weighed in on the change in an interview with Variety, when he was asked if it was true that MGM, which produced \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d had the copyright for both the ruby slippers and the yellow brick road. (TODAY has not independently confirmed MGM\u2019s copyrights.)",
      "\u201cWe had boundaries of what we could reference or not. We never use the ruby slippers,\u201d Chu explained. \u201cNessa has on crystal slippers as in the Frank L. Baum book, Gregory Maguire book and the show.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t think the phrase \u2018yellow brick road\u2019 is copywritten, but definitely the shape of the road is. We couldn\u2019t do the spiral. We had to do a circle that continues to show it\u2019s not where the road ends.\u201d",
      "Some eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed an Easter egg paying homage to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d when Glinda, played by Grande, briefly grabs a pair of sparkly red slippers while she\u2019s performing \u201cPopular\u201d in the film.",
      "She gifts the shoes to Elphaba, portrayed by Erivo, promising her she\u2019ll do everything she can to help make the future Wicked Witch of the West the most well-liked girl at Shiz.",
      "It turns out the creators of \u201cWicked\u201d have had the power to change the color of the iconic slippers all along, my dear."

      "When no one came to rescue them, the children began walking in the jungle in search of help, he said.",
      "\"(Lesly) said she didn\u2019t know where she was going, and they started leaving clues, so if someone was looking for them noticed, they started leaving clues at the places they were sleeping,\" he said, per Reuters.",

I mean, I have a manager now, and at some point I\u2019ll probably have to take a leave of absence for a while, and then assess and see if I would stay or start singing, but for the most part, other than singing out, I\u2019m still the same person, same guy, not changed.\u201d",
      "Goodall, who\u2019s worked as a school janitor for 23 years, says everyone in his school views him as just another person in the halls.",

      "The road to victory, however, was a long time coming. Goodall initially tried out for the show in 2009, but he didn\u2019t make the cut. He eventually tried out again, thanks to encouragement from his wife, Angela, whom he married several days prior to the Sept. 24 season finale.",

      "\u201cAGT\u201d flew him out to Los Angeles and put him up in a hotel. He was alone as his journey on the show \u2014 and to stardom \u2014 began. He kept to a budget using a supermarket club card to stock up on lunch meat and cottage cheese, which he kept in the mini-refrigerator in his room. He was anxious, but his nerves would melt away when his time to shine came.",

And so, in the following rounds, I had Ange with me, and it was a little bit better, and was a little bit easier. And each round it got a little bit easier, because I was a little more confident.\u201d",

He\u2019s performed the national anthem at multiple sporting events and will open for \u201cAGT\u201d judge Howie Mandel at a show in December. He says \u201cregular concerts\u201d will begin in January, noting that \u201cthings are starting to open up.\u201d There are no plans to record an album right now, but he says he \u201cwould love to.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Not long after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he had recommended that his Cabinet approve a ceasefire with Hezbollah to end hostilities in Lebanon, his office announced that the ministers had done just that.",
      "But Israel \"reserves its right to act against any threat to its security,\" his office said.",
      "\"The ceasefire allows us to focus on the Iranian threat,\" Netanyahu said in a televised address. \"We will complete the elimination of Hamas, the return of all the hostages and the return of the residents of the north.\"",
      "The deal, which was brokered by the United States and lauded by President Joe Biden, will be implemented Wednesday at 4 a.m. local time.",

      "Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most important proxy, would also withdraw to the north of Lebanon\u2019s Litani River and about 5,000 Lebanese army troops will move to the south. The Lebanese military is not officially a party to the conflict."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli government failed in its \u201cprimary duty to protect its citizens\u201d in the lead-up to and during the Oct. 7, terrorist attacks, according to an Israeli civilian report released Tuesday.",
      "The Civilian Board of Inquiry, which has been investigating evidence of intelligence failures around the Hamas attacks, laid the blame on Israel's defense and intelligence establishment, as well as civilian leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who it said silenced '\"dissenting voices\" and did not strike Hamas pre-emptively.",
      "\"The foremost sin was arrogance, which blinded state leaders and security officials from confronting reality,\" according to an NBC News translation from Hebrew.",
      "The board, which is not connected to Israel\u2019s government and cannot officially compel it to act, is made up of former members of the judiciary, military, civil service and relatives of Oct. 7 victims.",
      "The report, which says it interviewed 120 witnesses, also called on the government to launch an official inquiry into the attacks, something Netanyahu has refused to do so despite calls from the families of hostages and other victims.",
      "Netanyahu \u201cbears significant responsibility\u201d for the policy of \u201cmoney for quiet,\u201d the report also said, referring to allegations that the prime minister encouraged the Qatari government to send millions of dollars a month to the Gaza Strip in the hopes of maintaining the peace.",
      "NBC News has approached Netanyahu\u2019s office for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage during the attacks as Hamas fighters infiltrated Israel from southern Gaza and launched thousands of rockets. The incident, described as the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, profoundly shook Israeli society and damaged a sense of security built over years.",
      "The war that followed the attack has killed more than 44,000 people in Gaza\u00a0\u2014\u00a0most of them women and children\u00a0\u2014\u00a0according to local officials, driven much of the population of the enclave to the brink of famine and destroyed many of its buildings.",
      "The Israeli report also identified a \"major cause\" of the Oct. 7 tragedy as a \"glaring failure\" by Israeli intelligence branches.",
      "It specifically pointed to Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency, and military intelligence for their inability to provide timely warnings or act on those that were issued.",
      "Israel\u2019s intelligence services appeared blindsided by the attack, despite having long been seen as some of the most capable in the world, with an array of human intelligence, eavesdropping and other technical means covering the occupied West Bank and\u00a0the Gaza Strip.",
      "In a response attached to the committee\u2019s report, Shin Bet said that it \u201cvalues civilian engagement,\u201d but that a state commission of inquiry \u201cmust be established.\u201d",
      "Benny Gantz, a former defense minister and key rival of Netanyahu's who quit Israel\u2019s war Cabinet in June, echoed Shin Bet\u2019s calls for an official inquiry, which he said \"must be established without delay.\"",
      "In a response attached to the committee\u2019s report, he said an official inquiry would help with \"initiating the process of national healing, restoring public trust, and strengthening national resilience.\"",
      "The report also criticized Israel's former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, for \"reducing troop presence near Gaza, the lack of preparedness of southern forces, and ignoring multiple warning signs.\"",
      "NBC News has reached out to Gallant for comment.",
      "In July, the Israeli military released an assessment of its failures to protect the residents of\u00a0Be\u2019eri, one of the communities hit the hardest by the attack, where more than 100 people were killed and dozens taken hostage in an assault that left much of the kibbutz destroyed.",
      "The report, based on an internal inquiry, said the Israeli military \u201cfailed in its mission\u201d to protect the kibbutz,\u00a0a few miles from the border with the\u00a0Gaza Strip, because of grave errors in Israel\u2019s response to the multipronged assault.",
      "In September, former soldiers from a military observation unit told NBC News that their warnings about suspicious Hamas activity ahead of the\u00a0Oct. 7 terror attacks\u00a0were repeatedly ignored.",
      "\u201cIf I had been valued a little more \u2014 not much, just a little \u2014 maybe it could have ended differently,\u201d\u00a0Roni Lifshitz, one of the former observers, said. \u201cIt\u2019s anger and sadness, mainly frustration, because I was there and no one listened to me.\u201d",

      "The 80-strong choir has come together to do more than sing, though \u2014 the crew of architects, stonemasons, archaeologists, art historians, art conservators and others have helped rebuild Paris\u2019 Notre-Dame cathedral after a fire ripped through the iconic French Gothic masterpiece nearly five years ago.",
      "With hundreds of people working to rebuild a structure so intimately tied to French art, history and culture, it felt natural to start a choir, said Stephanie Duch\u00eane, a conservation scientist and chemical engineer who helped form the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir, or Notre Dame Companions, nearly two years ago.",
      "Much like the building and rebuilding of a cathedral, a small army of individuals needs to work in unison to create extraordinary music.",

It will be part of a weekslong celebration marking the long-awaited reopening.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:07:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions got underway Monday morning, with reigning champion Ding Liren taking game 1 of the World Chess Championship against 18-year-old phenom Gukesh Dommaraju.",
      "While the world championship is still considered chess' marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the $2.5 million showdown between Liren, a soft-spoken assassin from China, and Gukesh, an up-and-coming prodigy from India, should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",
      "Howell points to \u201ca clear shift\u201d over the past 10 years away from Russia and toward China and India.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."

      "Salah is Liverpool\u2019s all-time leading Premier League goalscorer. He\u2019s been sensational this season and the talisman in Liverpool\u2019s return to being a perennial challenger for all of soccer\u2019s top trophies.",
      "But Salah, 32, is out of contract this summer, along with Liverpool\u2019s captain Virgil van Dijk, 33, who is one of the best defenders of all-time, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, 26, one of the greatest products of Liverpool\u2019s youth system who has won everything in the game along with Salah and Van Dijk over the past seven years. Salah is to Liverpool what Michael Jordan was to the Chicago Bulls. Van Dijk is Rodman. Alexander-Arnold is Pippen.",
      "That these three stars are out of contract this summer, while Liverpool are having one of their best-ever starts to a season, is puzzling for most Liverpool fans.",
      "Salah\u2019s comments over the last week cranks up the pressure on Liverpool\u2019s owners, the Fenway Sports Group (FSG) who also own the Boston Red Sox, to give these three superstars huge new contracts. That isn\u2019t necessarily going to happen due to Liverpool\u2019s wage structure, league-imposed spending limits, the age of Salah and Van Dijk, and the direction Michael Edwards, who has just returned to Liverpool as their new Chief Executive of Football, wants to go in.",
      "Salah, and either Van Dijk or Alexander-Arnold, could still stay at Liverpool after adding a few more winners\u2019 medals around their neck this season. But surely not all three. This situation has a very \u201cLast Dance\u201d feel about it."

    "summary": "LONDON \u2014 The countryside came to the capital as thousands of farmers packed into London streets around Britain\u2019s Parliament to protest changes to tax rules.",

      "LONDON \u2014 The countryside came to the capital as thousands of farmers packed into London streets around Britain\u2019s Parliament to protest changes to tax rules.",
      "Some drove tractors, others brought hay bales, many carried signs saying \u201cno farms, no food.\u201d All were protesting against the new Labour government\u2019s decision to tax inherited agricultural property.",
      "\u201cBritish farmers make less than 1% profit,\u201d Tom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers Union (NFU), said in a statement to NBC News shortly after last week\u2019s protests. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the money in the bank to pay this proposed family farm tax.\u201d",
      "It was the first major demonstration in London since Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government took power in July. Rachel Reeves, his finance minister, announced the changes, which are set to come into effect in April 2026, in her annual budget last month.",
      "Similar to estate tax in the U.S., inheritance tax in the U.K. is charged at 40% on the property, possessions and money of someone who has died, above a threshold of 325,000 pounds, or around $410,000. A spousal exemption means married couples and civil partners can pool their allowances to pass on up to $1.2 million to their heirs tax-free.",
      "But under the current rules, land holdings used for crops or rearing animals, plus farm buildings, cottages and houses, have been handed down through the generations without the need to pay the tax, meaning together the total value of a tax-free inheritance could be around $3.77 million.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than $1.3 million will face a 20% tax when they are passed on to the next generation, half the usual rate.",
      "Defending the changes, which supporters say will recoup money from wealthy people who have bought up agricultural land as an investment and driven up the cost of farmland, Starmer said at the Group of 20 summit in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro last week that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of farms would be \u201cunaffected\u201d by the taxation changes.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.K.\u2019s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) also said in a statement that \u201caround 500 claims of Agricultural and Business Property Relief each year will be impacted,\u201d figures that were \u201cbased off actual claims data.\u201d",
      "A separate report published Monday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economics research institute, also said that \u201csignificantly less than 500 estates per year\u201d will be affected by the changes.",
      "But the NFU, along with the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), a membership organization representing land, property and businesses owners, have estimated that tens of thousands more will be affected.",
      "\u201cMinisters claim the inheritance tax cap hits only the rich, but it could put 70,000 farms \u2014 big and small \u2014 at risk. All will be questioning their future, and whether they\u2019ll have one to pass on,\u201d CLA President Victoria Vyvyan said in a statement.",
      "Noting the disparity between the government\u2019s figure and its own, on its website the CLA said it was \u201clooking at the impact on farms over a generation, whereas the government\u2019s figure is only looking at a single year. We are not \u2014 claiming that 70,000 farms will shut down or have to pay the tax a year.\u201d The website defines a generation as 40 years.",
      "The NFU pointed NBC News to a Nov. 21 report it produced with economists who formerly worked for Britain\u2019s Treasury and Office for Budget Responsibility that says around 75% of commercial family farms would be required to pay the tax.",
      "The protest in London was supported by JCB, which manufactures a wide range of farming equipment and machinery for construction. After giving its employees the day off to join the demonstrations, the company said in a statement that it was \u201ccrucial that food from Britain feeds our nation as not all the food we need can come from abroad.\u201d",
      "Despite the gray skies and wet weather, those who did join witnessed scenes similar to those seen in other European cities, where roads have been snarled by farmers protesting a variety of issues including grain prices and European Union farming policies.",
      "But while some of the protests on the continent turned violent, in London the mood was much more jovial as\u00a0children on toy tractors pedaled around Parliament Square after a rally addressed by speakers including former \u201cTop Gear\u201d TV host and celebrity farmer Jeremy Clarkson.",
      "While some promised to escalate the protests unless the hike is removed, Starmer\u2019s government, which won a large majority in July\u2019s general election, looks set to stand firm.",
      "\u201cOur commitment to our farmers is steadfast \u2014 we have committed \u00a35 billion to the farming budget over two years, including more money than ever for sustainable food production,\u201d the Defra spokesperson said.",
      "Environment Minister Steve Reed also told reporters last week that the government was \u201ctaking decisions because they\u2019re in the interest of every part of the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be sorry for trying to make this country\u2019s economy work and our public services work again,\u201d he said."

      "The 13-year civil war in Syria has roared back into prominence\u00a0with a surprise rebel offensive\u00a0on Aleppo, one of Syria\u2019s largest cities and an ancient business hub. The push is among the rebels\u2019 strongest in years in a war whose destabilizing effects have rippled far beyond the country\u2019s borders.",
      "It was the first opposition attack on Aleppo since 2016, when a brutal air campaign by Russian warplanes helped Syrian President Bashar Assad retake the northwestern city. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power, within the 70% of Syria under his control.",
      "The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East, at a time when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups.",
      "Robert Ford, the last-serving U.S. ambassador to Syria, pointed to months of Israeli strikes on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in the area, and to Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon this week, as factors providing Syria\u2019s rebels with the opportunity to advance.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the key aspects of the new fighting:",
      "Why does it matter?",
      "Assad has been at war with opposition forces seeking his overthrow for 13 years, a conflict that\u2019s killed an estimated half-million people. Some 6.8 million Syrians have fled the country, a refugee flow that helped change the political map in Europe by fueling anti-immigrant far-right movements.",
      "The roughly 30% of the country not under Assad is controlled by a range of opposition forces and foreign troops. The U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, far from Aleppo, to guard against a resurgence by the Islamic State. Both the U.S. and Israel conduct occasional strikes in Syria against government forces and Iran-allied militias. Turkey has forces in Syria as well, and has influence with the broad alliance of opposition forces storming Aleppo."

    "story": [
      "BEIRUT \u2014 Islamist rebels breached neighborhoods in Syria\u2019s second-largest city of Aleppo and clashed with government military forces after detonating two car bombs Friday. The incident, reported by a leading war monitoring group and The Associated Press, has renewed international attention on a country wracked by civil war and extremism for\u00a0more than a decade.",
      "The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, the monitoring organization, said fierce clashes were underway between the attacking insurgents and regime troops. The fighting is a significant escalation since rebels launched a surprise offensive Wednesday, seizing towns and villages as they advanced toward Aleppo.",
      "The breach marked the first time opposition forces besieged the city since 2016, when they were driven out of Aleppo\u2019s eastern neighborhoods during a military operation in which Syrian troops were supported by Russia and Iran. Four years ago, a ceasefire brought an end to the most intense violence, but the new push from rebels has upended a period of relative calm.",
      "The rebels appear to have gained momentum by the diminished strength of Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah throughout the region, illustrating how the conflicts in the Middle East feed off one another.Witnesses who spoke to The Associated Press said Aleppo residents were fleeing from areas on the western edge amid missiles and exchanges of gunfire. The AP said an insurgent commander posted a recorded message on social media urging the city\u2019s residents to cooperate with the rebels. The rebels are led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS.",
      "Syrian armed forces were repelling attacks, the\u00a0Syrian Defense ministry said\u00a0Friday, adding government forces involved in combat operations were able to regain control over some areas.",
      "\"Our armed forces have inflicted heavy losses on the attacking organizations, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries among the terrorists,\" Syria's general command of the army and armed forces said in a statement translated by NBC News. \"Dozens of vehicles and armored carriers have been destroyed, and we have successfully shot down and destroyed seventeen drones.\"",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of on-the-ground information sources, said at least 121 people have been killed since the start of HTS\u2019 shock offensive, including at least 20 civilians.",
      "Syrian state media reports cited by the AP said insurgent-fired projectiles struck student accommodations at Aleppo\u2019s university in the city center, killing four people, including two students.",
      "The Syrian civil war started in early 2011 with a wave of protests against the authoritarian rule of President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, bolstered by arms shipments from Iran and Russia, cracked down forcefully on the popular uprisings, setting off a spiral of violence and fueling an aggressive insurgency.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 British lawmakers voted on Friday in favor of a landmark bill that would for the first time help terminally ill adults end their lives.",
      "The initial parliamentary vote in favor \u2014 330 for and 275 against \u2014 starts months of debate and possible changes to the bill as it works through the House of Commons and the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords.",
      "If eventually passed, it will see the U.K. follow other countries such as Canada and Australia, as well as some U.S. states, and represent one of the most significant social reforms in a generation.",
      "The bill would allow mentally competent adults in England and Wales with fewer than six months to live to request and receive help to end their lives.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently illegal in Britain and carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years. That same sentence will remain for anyone found guilty of tricking, pressuring or coercing someone into making the choice if the bill is ultimately passed.",
      "Debate around the contentious bill, which will continue to be discussed in Parliament in the run up to the vote, has prompted an uncommon outpouring of politicians\u2019 emotions and moral persuasions in a political system where voting usually happens along party lines.",
      "It has drawn comment from former prime ministers, religious leaders, judges and doctors, and shone a light on one of the few issues \u2014 birth and taxes perhaps being the only other two \u2014 that happen to everyone. The outcome of the vote looks to be uncertain given how many members of parliament have expressed their ambivalence on the issue.",
      "Those in favor of the bill say such a law would relieve the unnecessary suffering of those with terminal illness and provide dignity and agency in a situation where the two are in short supply. Opponents say it could put the country on a slippery slope and place vulnerable people, such as the elderly or handicapped, at risk or put them under pressure to end their lives in order to not burden their loved ones.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, an MP for the ruling Labour Party, proposed the bill, arguing it has \u201cthree layers of scrutiny.\u201d Two independent doctors and a judge will be needed to sign off on any decision before the state allows a patient end their life.",
      "One example of a similar law put forward by detractors of the bill is that of Canada, where government figures show that 4% of deaths are due to patients opting to end their lives. Euthanasia, which is also allowed in Canada and Netherlands and allows for doctors to give lethal injections, is different from assisted suicide and is not being debated in the U.K.",
      "A 2023 government report showing figures from 2022 showed a 30% jump in the number of people choosing to end their lives, with more than a third of the 13,000 exercising their right saying their decision was partly due to feeling like a burden on loved ones. Canada currently plans to extend the law in 2027 to those whose sole underlying condition is related to mental health.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been lots of assurances about safeguards,\u201d Gordon Macdonald, CEO of advocacy group Care Not Killing told Reuters. \u201cBut in every jurisdiction in the world where it\u2019s happened, the safeguards have been removed or eroded over time.\u201d",
      "Even so, the U.K. bill has broad public support \u2014 a poll conducted last week by YouGov showed that 73% of the British public back the bill as opposed to 13% who said they don\u2019t.\u00a0While the current prime minister Keir Starmer has previously opposed assisted dying, he has not said how he plans to vote Friday.",
      "Terminally ill broadcasting veteran Esther Rantzen, 84, has stage four cancer and has long supported a change in the law.\u00a0\u201cIf I want assisted death, which I do because I want to have the choice, I will have to go to Switzerland\u2026 to achieve that,\u201d she told Sky News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fortunate because I can afford to go,\u201d she added, \u201cbut for all the hundreds of thousands of people in the future who can\u2019t afford that and who want to die in their own homes surrounded by the people they love\u2026 they will have the choice if this law is changed and that would be a very good change.\u201d",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown and three of his Conservative successors \u2014 Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss \u2014 have all publicly come out against the bill. But former-Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron this week said that he had reversed his opposition to the U.K. bill.",
      "Writing in The Times of London newspaper, Cameron said the bill specifically excludes mental health or disability grounds and that the safeguards contained in the bill will allow it to meaningfully reduce human suffering.",
      "Cameron also refuted arguments \u2014 such as the one posed by the current health secretary Wes Streeting \u2014 that the expense and additional administration could add to pressure on the country\u2019s beleaguered National Health Service. The former prime minister wrote that the bill would apply to a very small number of cases and that \u201cthe NHS exists to serve patients and the public, not the other way around.\u201d"

A 1,200-year-old castle in Prague houses one, an ancient former mosque in Cordoba another, and a decommissioned\u00a0power station in London a third.",

The two Koreas are still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.",
      "Tensions between the two Koreas are clear to see.",
      "Last month, Pyongyang blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the border as part of its push to scrap its long-standing goal of unification. North Korea has also this year sent thousands of balloons attached to bags of trash, old batteries and manure across the border, with one landing in Seoul\u2019s presidential compound.",

      "For some customers, enjoying a cup of joe while overlooking fields and a North Korean village is calming \u2014 even if Kim Jong Un has repeatedly threatened to send nuclear weapons across the border.",

      "Maye Musk, a model and dietitian, has been a frequent visitor to China since last year, gaining a big online following from a Chinese public curious to know more about the woman who raised their business idol while becoming a celebrity in her own right as a \u201csilver-haired influencer.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe basically did it her way,\u201d Dudarenok said. \u201cThat was one message that resonated very strongly.\u201d",
      "The other appeal, she said, \u201cwas that people wanted to figure out, how do you actually give birth [to] and raise billionaires?\u201d",
      "The book has found an audience among working women in China, who are increasingly resistant to social pressure to get married and have children, even as the Chinese government clamps down on the feminist movement and says it is up to them to boost the national birth rate.",
      "\u201cA must-read for all girls! Thank you for showing us the resilience and strength of women,\u201d one Xiaohongshu user wrote.",

      "She is also a global brand ambassador for Chinese mattress brand AISE Baobao, attending a store opening in Shanghai this month, and has appeared in smartphone advertisements for Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Oppo.",
      "Her popularity in China could come in handy for her son. Though Elon Musk is still widely admired, Dudarenok said there has been a \u201ccooling off\u201d in public opinion since he financially backed the campaign of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to be tough on China.",

      "BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s ByteDance is suing a former intern for $1.1 million, alleging he deliberately attacked its artificial intelligence large language model training infrastructure, a case that has drawn widespread attention within China amid a heated AI race.",
      "The parent company of TikTok is seeking 8 million yuan ($1.1 million) in damages from the former intern, Tian Keyu, in a lawsuit filed with the Haidian District People\u2019s Court in Beijing, the state-owned Legal Weekly reported this week.",
      "While lawsuits between companies and employees are common in China, legal action against an intern and for such a large sum is unusual.",
      "The case has drawn attention due to its focus on AI LLM training, a technology that has captured global interest amid rapid technological advances in so-called generative AI, used to produce text, images or other output from large bodies of data.",
      "ByteDance declined to comment on the lawsuit on Thursday. Tian, whom other Chinese media outlets have identified as a postgraduate student at Peking University, did not immediately respond to emailed messages.",
      "Tian is alleged to have deliberately sabotaged the team\u2019s model training tasks through code manipulation and unauthorized modifications, according to Legal Weekly, which cited an internal ByteDance memo.",
      "In a social media post in October, ByteDance said it had dismissed the intern in August. It said that, while there were rumors that the case had cost ByteDance losses in millions of dollars and involving over 8,000 graphics processing units, these were \u201cseriously exaggerated.\u201d"

      "The official declined to provide further information, citing privacy concerns.",
      "Li, 62, who is from Long Island, New York, was detained in 2016 and sentenced to 10 years in 2018 on espionage charges his family says are baseless. Swidan, a Texas businessman in his 40s, had been detained since 2012 and was sentenced to death with a reprieve in 2019 after being convicted on drug-related charges that a United Nations working group said had no evidential basis.",

Leung, who was detained in 2021, had been a member of a pro-Beijing group in the United States and had been pictured with senior Chinese officials, according to Hong Kong and Chinese news outlets.",

      "With the return of Li and Swidan, all Americans officially designated as wrongfully detained in China have been released, the State Department spokesperson said.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 More than 700,000 homes and businesses were without power across a frigid Ukraine early Thursday after Russia launched a widespread missile and drone attack on the country\u2019s energy sector.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said the \u201ccomplex strike\u201d was a retaliation for Ukraine\u2019s using American-made ATACMS missiles to strike inside Russia. Despite the widespread civilian impact, he claimed, without evidence, that the assault targeted military sites.",
      "Air raid sirens began to ring out late Wednesday and blared for more than nine hours. People across the country took refuge in bomb shelters, subway stations and even their own bathrooms, waiting out the bombardment alongside strollers, pets and what few blankets they could carry.",
      "The power grid was targeted just as cold weather begins to bite, a tactic that Ukrainian officials and Western analysts say Russia deliberately deploys. The temperature is forecast to stay below 35 degrees Fahrenheit all of Thursday, with fog in the air and snow already covering Kyiv\u2019s roofs.",
      "\u201cIt was about 6 a.m. I was sleeping and heard a very loud explosion in my dream,\u201d said Valeria Grinchuk, 24, a makeup artist in the city of Lutsk. \u201cI just ran into the corridor with my cats and immediately heard two more explosions,\u201d at which point the power went out, she added.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see what was on the news and so didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d she said. Grinchuk, who has a gas stove, said \"we've gotten used to it a little\" but described the conditions as \"very uncomfortable.\"",
      "\u201cI feel very strong hatred, and I still can't get in my head the fact that this is all reality,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't understand how with so much beauty in the world you can make people's lives such hell.\u201d",
      "The physical discomfort of the outages is compounded by the uncertainty of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s looming inauguration on Jan. 20. His reluctance to commit support for Ukraine brings a huge degree of uncertainty to the conflict, just as Russia is making its fastest battlefield gains since the early days of the 2022 invasion.",
      "It was Russia\u2019s 11th attack on Ukraine\u2019s energy sector this year, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it a \u201cvery vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics.\u201d",
      "Ukraine said it had detected 188 incoming \u201cattack targets,\u201d including 57 cruise missiles fired from Tupolev Tu-95 bombers, 28 Kalibr cruise missiles fired from ships in the Black Sea and 97 Iran-designed Shahed drones, according to a post by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cAgain, energy system is under a massive attack from the enemy,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, wrote on social media. \u201cAttacks on energy facilities are taking place all over Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said the attacks included cluster munitions, which \u201cmake it much more difficult for our rescuers and energy workers to eliminate the consequences of the impact.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden called the attack \u201chorrific\u201d in a statement Thursday that aimed to reassure Ukraine of U.S. support.",
      "\u201cThis attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said.",
      "\u201cEarlier this year, and at my direction, the United States began prioritizing air defense exports so they go to Ukraine first,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Department of Defense has delivered hundreds of additional air defense missiles to Ukraine, as a consequence of this decision, and further deliveries are underway.\u201d",
      "Putin gave details of the attack at a summit in Kazakhstan of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization.",
      "\u201cI repeat once again that these strikes on our part were in response to unrelenting strikes onto the Russian territory with the U.S. ATACMS missiles,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I have said many times, there will always be a response from our part.\u201d",
      "He derided the way Ukraine \"nags its masters for other weapons.\"",
      "Ukraine has made no secret of its desire for more Western assistance, making the case that Kyiv is defending not just itself but all of Europe and the West against Kremlin aggression. After the attack, Zelenskyy reiterated calls for his allies to provide more military assistance.",
      "\u201cEach such attack proves that air defense systems are needed now in Ukraine, where they save lives, and not in storage bases,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially important in the winter, when we have to protect our infrastructure from targeted Russian strikes.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s existing air defenses were able to bring down more than 100 of the incoming projectiles, the army said, but dozens got through.",
      "Worst hit were several western regions that do not often face Russian attack. As of Thursday morning, 523,000 homes and businesses in the Lviv region were without power, Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram.",
      "In neighboring Volyn, 215,000 customers were without electricity, Gov. Ivan Rudnytskyi, wrote, after a transformer substation was hit in the regional capital, Lutsk. Other outages were reported in the Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zhytomyr and Rivne oblasts, with many schools telling children to study at home.",
      "In Cherkasy, entrepreneur Elena Bondarenko, 52, endured a night of \u201csirens, drones, then you don\u2019t sleep listening to every sound and monitoring news. It was scary and unpleasant,\u201d she said.",
      "She and her husband have endured power cuts before. This time they faced hours more without electricity, and another outage was scheduled in the evening as the grid tries to cope with the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to live like that. It ruins all your life. It ruins the order of life and any plans you make,\u201d she said of the blackouts. \u201cEverything that is happening now is awful. Well, a human can adjust to everything, but I don\u2019t want to get used to it. Is it even possible to live like that?\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, officials said, anti-aircraft guns intercepted all inbound targets, although falling debris caused damage in the Dniprovskyy and Darnytskyy districts, damaging a truck and buildings in an industrial area.",
      "The Energy Ministry said in an online post that \u201cpower engineers are working to provide backup power schemes where possible. They have already begun restoration work where the security situation allows.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attack, which came hours after Trump said he would nominate retired Gen. Keith Kellogg to serve as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Kellogg has suggested he could condition U.S. military aid to Kyiv on its participation in peace talks with Russia.",
      "The U.S. has provided $70 billion in military aid to Ukraine, more than any other country. Trump has repeatedly declined to commit to continuing the assistance, instead saying he would finish the war before his inauguration \u2014 without saying how."
